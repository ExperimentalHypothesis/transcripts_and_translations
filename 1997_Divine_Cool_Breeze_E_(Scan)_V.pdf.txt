 Editorial Golden Words he message of God has come to mankind in the golden words of the great prophets and incarnations. The first known message was given by Lord Krishna to Prince Arjuna on the battlefield of Mahabharata known as the 'hitupdesh' or the Gita. But this was an advice given exclusively to Arjuna in the context of his mental blocks and the need of the situation. 5000 years later Lord Jesus Clrist preached the gospel of love and forgiveness to mankind which was compiled long after his crucification called the Bible. In the 6th century the Prophet Mohammad had visions of God's message which he narrated to his wife. 40 years after his death these teachings were consolidated as the Holy Koran by a remote follower. These were the prime sources of God's communication to mankind. The turbulances of History marred by papal manipulations no doubt blurred the lustre of these golden words. Fortunately, in modern times the Divine herself has incarnated as Her Holiness Mataji Shree Nirmala Devi to communicate directly with all humanity for its en masse ascent. But do we listen? Do we listen to only what we want to hear. Often we quote only that which suits our convenience "Mother said this...". Each golden word is a mantra to be read again and again, to introspect and to imbibe. She is not speaking for others, she is speaking to each one of us. It is a common hallucination that she is saying it for others and not for LIS. No incarnation studied human beings and their problems so minutely and deeply as she does. Hence when she speaks the vibrations flow to work out the problem. If we listen with rapt attention and absorb each word, it will work out like a mantra at every chakra. This is Divine Vani' which feels, loves and acts. It is all powerful and all pervading. Yes, when she speaks every word falls like pearls into the ocean. It is Divine music that elevates us to celestial heights and blesses us with ambrosia. Often our intellect tries to argue with what she says. Our own idea, convictions, mental jargans and conditionings start projecting immediately. But we should question ourself, "who are we and what is so important about what we think and say." It is only a mental projection of our programming like a computer throwing out information based on its floppy programme. Therefore wisdom lies in realising our limitations and shortcomings and recognise the truth. The truth is that we are the Spirit, not this body, mind intellect or ego. So why identify and support falsehood against absolute truth whcih is her Divine message. The human intellect tends to find excuses or offer explainations, but of what use are they and to whom. By playing games with ourself we only deceive ourself and hasten towards our doom. Christ warned, "those who are not with me are against me" Nor is there any room for any half hearted commitments, for that will only produce half baked yogis. Hence we cannot mellow down her words for then they would cease to be golden.. In this Blossom time what a golden opportunity is at hand, golden words of the Divine are being compiled in the eternal scripture of Divine Cool Breeze", Let us wear them close in our hearts and flow with the Divine Cool Breeze. Yogi Mahajan

 Divine Cool Breeze Volume: IX isue: 9 & 10 1997 Krishna Puja (Cabella 23.08.1997) Talk by H. H. Mataji Shree Nirmala Devi oday we are here to celebrate Krishna very important in these modern times. Exposure of body is regarded as a great achievement of women. They are trying to become aboriginals "No, let me talk about Krishna only," because we you seel. That time they never had these ideas and they were not so confused, you see. So even if their women were scantily dressed it did not mean that it was some sort of a sex or some sort of a attraction for men. Or men behaving in a Dharma does not mean what we understand as funny manner to show that they have a special attraction for women. I mean why you should? It not. Dharma means our primordial taboos that is absolutely absurd that men should be attracted are built-in in the human beings. About these, I to women and women should be attracted to men. And on the road, on the street, you go, you what we did? We dominated them and also they see this, just that going on. This adharma is the had to change their style of life. The primordial worst, I think, for it is a curse. Because after taboos are only understood if people are trying coming to Sahaja Yoga also people start doing this nonsense, you know. They should all go to the lunatic asylum. They are no good for Sahaja is little bit different in the sense that it is much Yoga. But Dharma gets established as soon as you Puja. I went to America and they wanted me to have a Mahakali Puja. But I said have to first realize what is the strength of this Puja. How we are going to establish Shri Krishna within ourselves. He Himself has said that whenever there is a down fall of Dharma... Hinduism, Christianity or Islamic nonsense. It is think, aboriginals knew belter than we. But then to understand oneself or else whatever has come to them through traditions. Now Sahaja Dharma higher than the Sahaja ideas that we talk of, but have the light of the spirit. is much higher than even what Shri Krishna said At the time of Shri Rama He had to put down or Shri Rama said. First Shri Rama thought best ABCDEF. At the time of Moses also He had to is to give them discipline. People should be serious about life, have full idea about their own being. They should respect themselves. All these put down ten commandments. But Krishna thought the other way round: to establish the Dharma of puure Love, pure Love. So, because He things were written down long time back. Also wanted that Shri Rama's taboos were forced on people, basically when they were g√∂od, they ; just like Islamic, just like Christians. It people; understood that whatever is bad for us we should not do. These are primordial taboos. Now these primordial taboos are built-in within Lus never works. So he thought better to ask them in their freedom they must develop pure Love. Radha who was with him as his power, it is Now supposing I say, "don't drink." You will called Ahladdayini. She is the one who gives joy, go on drinking. If I say, "don't tell lies." You will pure joy. So all these limited type of attractions tell lies. It is the human nature. You see to go end up in trouble. Now drinking is against, you know that. Today they are talking about tobacco, tomorrow they will talk of drinking when they They are free people. Actually, they are not. They will find so many people suffering from horrible are under the spell of all the kinds of allurements livers and die. Then they will taboo it. But it is you can call or temptations which are against a natural taboo for your body. If you do human life. And it is very natural to be a person something all the time which is not good for you, for your good life you are becoming example I have seen children they feel very shy adharmic. This is to be understood very clearly, to take out their clothes. Even small, small boys, that the Sahaja Dharma is that you are just free. I have seen. They won't take out their clothes in Complete freedom, from lust greed and all nonsense. You are above it. You are above. This are described like Ya Devi Sarva Bhuteshu Lajja Dharma is above the Dharma established by Shri Krishna or by Shri Rama. Because you have should be humble and respect your body. It is reached that stage, in complete freedom you have against primordial taboos because they think now they have freedom. Freedom to do what they like. of Dharma. Small children mostly have it. For the presence of others. They feel shy. So all these Rupena Samsthita. So you should be shy. You

 Divine Cool Breeze Volume: IX Issue: 9 & 10 1997 to be Dharmic. Whatever is not good for you, you dropped out. Specially in America it should stop. should not do. I don't have to tell you that you don't do this and you don't do that. Whatever I say may not be acceptable but immediately your looking like some monkey. Monkey is better, I vibrations will tell you. This is Sahaja Dharma, in the Sahaja Dharma you get rid of all kinds of, as they say, Kaam, Krodh, Mada, Lobh and Moh, compare, I tell you. So I asked him "why are you means Lust, Anger, Greed and Attractions. Now if you understand how people are greedyl Greedy for what? This America is dying primitiveness." I said, "but your brain is modern. of consumerism, you see. Now see the trick of the Just by growing your hair like that you think you trade: In America you can borrow any amount of money from the bank. No problem. Now even if afterwards I learnt that he died. Another one like you don't borrow they will send you a letter "Why do not you take twenty thousand cheque, asylum. Like that I met many. Why do you do it? we are sending you? Why not have it? Ah! very rich you become, you see! It is very nice to take the loan: I was told some people used to cone to Ganapatipule Puja after taking loans. I said, "Stop this nonsense!" So they take the loan and then they come to Ganapatipule. All the time their mind is "how will I pay this loan? How will fellow said that "My God! you lost your hand in I manage?" All the time the attention is distracted. Even when you wvant to do something expensive watch from Switzerland." "Really? good to yourself of coming to Ganapatipule. So such a mind is not free. The free mind is that hand is gone. Rollex is a fashion. So these are which has attention completely enlightened by nouveau riche people who have money. the spirit. But problem is, we are still rising out of this human bondage to a higher life of realization. And when we are going to that level taking? I mean supposing, the Italian designers we have to realize that we have to give up all these shackles, all these horrible things within us, like a bird when it is born out of the egg, shakes out all the parts of the egg = sisters, your father, your mother, your husband, everybody. They try to put you down When, they are drinking they say "come along! you better have something to drink. You are not expensive, why? because they are designers. So social, you are useless, you are not up-to-date, wearing this thing from a designer shop, this is what is this nonsense?" That's how a fashion starts. And this collective action of fashion did you? You have no sense of designs, You have no not come from Shri Krishna and not in Sahaja. In Sahaja you are absolutely free from all these you don't need. And nowadays most of them are nonsenses. If you want you can wear good dress, in jail also. Sorry to say but they have money. if Also in England. A fellow came as a hippy. His hair were must say. They don't like what? All put together like a, you can say, I mean there is nothing to having such hair?" He said, "because I want to be primitive. Now we have to take to the can become primitive? You cannot." Then that came and he didn't die but went to lunatic Because that is the fashion. Now Italy, you know is prospering because of all kinds of designers. Now there is a joke about nouveau riche people, in Russia specially. Russians are not like that, normally. They don't accept something because it is a fashion. So one that day!" "Does not matter. But I lost my very What?" "It was Rollex." Does not matter if the They (dogs) don't follow any fashion. I have not seen dogs taking to any fashion. Monkeys make something special for them. They won't think much of it, may be their masters might buy. But not the animals. Now, we don't have to your brothers, your become animals, of course. But we don't have to become slaves of fashion. So there are some shops which are very you know about telling everybdoy, "See, I am from designer shop." That means what about sernse of understanding, what you need and what don't want you need rot. You are free, you And they have made money by befooling you. you are free from money bondage. This is very Specially in America, I was surprised that they important. Money bondage is another thing. I know some Sahaja Yogis who came to Sahaja coming from Italy, designs, Italian designs. Yoga trying to make money out of Sahaja Yoga. Written down Italian design, so they buying it. I You come to Sahaja Yoga for what? To get out of that money bondage. In the Sahaja Dharma your that are available everywhere, such beautiful money is nothing but dust of your feet. Nothing things. But what they believe in is some sort of so important. Then we have such a collective sense of accepting nonsense. That has to be kind of design from this or that. were selling most of the things which were was surprised that such artistic things they create a group madness. Everybody wearing the same

We are not to accept any design or anything. Let the stupid they have a little street in his name. Of course in follow them. We are Sahaja Yogis. Now this also Washington they say they have some nice prevails among people who are supposed to be saddhus. They all dress up, the same way. How can you make out who is who? In Sahaja Yoga or other some people came and wrote against we don't want you to dress up the same way, look the same way, cut you hair the same way. No, you have to be individuals. Because you are free. Freedom is always supported by wisdom. something that is created by God.

See, the light of the spirit you don't get involved into look at the trees, look at the flowers and look at this kind of collective madness that is going on We are so collective in mad things! I wish they happy. What gives you happiness is variety. could be more collective in wise things. Wisdom Variety is a sign of beauty. If there is no variety, is very important and a joy giving quality of Radhaji, Ahladdayini Shakti has to come within very proud of it. And they think ruining of us. Then when we meet another person in the collectivity, that person should feel happy with people. They have a sense of superiority because 15 wanted.

What business they have to write against same colours everywhere they will all look like the different hues, the sky has just to make us so boring, I tell you, so very boring! But they are themselves. They think they are very great you. they have a certain type of nose, or may be a certain type of lips or may be a certain types of hair. Such stupid things they are.

I would say that now the Sahaja Specially for Americans. I think this kind of Yogi's who are going back to America should separation I found there among the blacks and the whites. I went to Harlem.

If you call me yellow I am yellow." So I am going. And there I had a lecture, they immediately said, "Mother, you are spiritual, you know. So many people were there. Really, I cannot forget. It is one of the most famous place that there is built in that hall and the same hall is built in Australia, where I had addressed many people. I thought just look at this.

But I was surprised nobody raised the of things. The light you put on me I absorb. I get voice against this. They should have raised voice, black spots. So what a great thing to be white they should have said the government "Please do not think so. It looks very funny and pale and joyless.

And then to think they much do we get impressed by these we should are superior. It is very nice: Somebody enters your house and thinks he is very superior and drives out all the people of the family. That is what is happening in America. be on the watch. I saw my grand daughter was wearing a sleeveless dress. I told her "Bete you should not wear sleeveless dress" She said. "It is very hot. I am feeling very hot." She is young. I said, "See these are two very important chakras. If you expose them then you will have problem." She does not like to wear dresses which are above the knees. But she said, And just the opposite is Sahaja Dharma. With such Dharma you take people into your heart, you love them. Your love flows all the time, your compassion flows all the time. To me it is a problem now my body is more compassionate "people wear even above the than myself. I don't even think of compassion. knees." I said "knees, there are very important this body just grasps every thing, problems of others. But T don't think you can have that kind of a body, you should not have. But at least you immediately. "Mother I'll wear a should have a heart which is opened. You see on the street somebody who is a dark fellow. I like black Americans. Once I got down on an airport. So one gentleman, black gentleman "Hello taboo that we should not expose ours these two Darling! How are you here? Very happy to see you. I am happy to see you. How are you?" Then legs, I don't know they have shorter clothes. I once I was travelling in.. Husala was with me, He looked at me, one fellow, very tall, hefty, you know. He said, "Ah! Are you back again?" "Ham!" I said, "I am back, you know me?" "of course, of burka" because she was a Muslim. And by the course, I know you". He had never met me. But I felt happy. I felt very happy. That is the best way to meet people. Supposing you are walking √∂n the street. You see some black gentlemen wwear such a thing, to come out of the plane. You going. It is a terrible life there, I tell you. It is a terrible life for them. I know I have read books on them. I cried and wept. I felt very sorry. So, as a Sahaja Yogi you should just jump at them. And you should say "Hello! How are you?" Shake hands with them. They won't eut your throat I can tell you. In criminality I don't know who is more criminal in America. Whether they something is not Alhaddayni, keep quiet. Don't are the blacks or the whites. Competing. But if say, What is the need. What is there to be you are kind and if you are loving you can remove that part of criminality which is within them; because hatred can be only washed away you talk sarcastically to others, in a sharp way. by pure love. But people think that they are very But if you talk sweetly what is the harm. This cunning, very superior in cunningness, of course. Otherwise what is their superiority? Only this chakras." We should keep them closed. Otherwise, if these are affected, you will have knee trouble. " Immediately she changed3; blouse from M inside and something from outside." Immediately. Because she knew this is our natural primordial chakras. But nowadays the more you have long don't understand what is in the legs. The whole beauty is in the legs or what? So I met one lady who travelled with me. She was wearing the time we landed in London she took out the burka and the dress was much above the knees. I said "What kind of a Muslim woman is she?" She is worst than even Christians because they won't have to come down on the staircase. No Lajja, No shame, nothing, shamelessness. So Sahaja Dharma is that have shame. You have sense of shame. What you talk to others, what you say to others, how you behave towards them in Sahaja Dharma is Alhaddayni. If you (sarcastic, showing off your brains in your sarcasm. It is not a sign of good breeding that sweetness comes from Radhaji. Now, of course, they have misused her They have made her into

To be the should dress up in a way that is perfectly alright. calibre of Sahaja Yoga you should be free of your Once I remember I was in a big party and one gentleman came and sat down "Ha!" I said, "What happened?" "What a relief, Mother! Mrs. Srivastava to see you! See these women. I am fed letters." I do not remember. I don't want to read up. But you came. I felt so relieved." I said what anything about it. So there should be forgiveness. is so relieved?" "You are so serene" so women are serene in Sahaja Dharma. They are not stupid, will feel very releaved and your married life will frivolous, laughing at anything. That is not the way for a woman. Anything happens they must something. Alright, some marriages are really, laugh. I mean if there is something even really very difficult, alright. So you get out. In laughable, that is alright. But something is not Sahaja Yoga we have allowed complete divorce. even laughable they will laugh. That is not the way. This can be ridiculous also. But laugh of think something is superior. Now we have appreciation, laugh of enjoyment is so pure and creates such beautiful atmosphere. I think the whole ecological problem is in our brains and your upbringing. It is not outside. It is inside us which is reflected outside. In Ganesha Now then better not marry and if you marry then Puja I am going to tell you how we are so closely live like an ideal Sahaja Yogi. Also if you are a related to Mother Earth, and how Mother Earth Sahaja Yogini then you can carry on very much and the atmosphere reacts to our behaviour, to better by forgiving all the time. Every time when how we live. In the Sahaja Dharma you give up people tell me "Oh! Mother. You see you must lust and greed very easily that I know. I mean if help me" "Why?" "Because, you know, my they can't even give up then they should not call themselves Sahaja Yogis. The first thing you give "give him up I do not mind. He must give you up is lust and greed. I find it among young people, now, that those who come to Sahaja Yoga talk to her husband he will say "Mother she is they come really very free people. They do not very extravagant". I said "you better give up run after women, women do not run after men. They are together, they sit together, talk together, In Sahaja Dharma the husband-wife relation laugh together but it is purity. In the Quran it is described that when Kyama will come beautiful beautiful. It is not you know we talk of love and women and beautiful men will be there. But they all that here. Very rarely people fall in love and will have no lust and greed. They will be pure. carry on. It is a blessing if you really get that Today you can see that luist and greed is finished, most of you, most of you. Automatically it is finished and now you can see for yourself that forget that you are Sahaja Yogis. In that Sahaja you are free of this bondage. Then our marriages are coming tomorrow. remember. The present is the best. Now if you are sitting here with me enjoying the Ahladdayini Shakti that time you are thinking about the past a very pure woman and she was past. Finished. There is no need to confess. I know after Sahaja Yoga many people wrote letters to me of confessions. And I just said "burn these If there is forgiveness you will be surprised you be very happy. But if you try to remember But must be for some reason. Not because you banned many countries from where we don't want to have girls or from where we don't want to have boys. What is the reason? With experience we have learnt they are not marriage substance. husband does not give me any money." I said money. Why doesn't he give you money?" You Sahaja Yoga, both of you, and da what you like." should be really romantic, should be really kind of a feeling. But mostly it is a curse. So to fall in love is very good but does not mean you Yoga helps a lot, I think, in your married life. Sahaja Dharma is for your children that you bring In the Sahaja Dharma first thing is very up your children not troubling them too much important is forgiveness. If somebody cannot forgive then he cannot be a Sahaja Yogi, Sometimes I know children go astray and try to Forgiveness: How this forgiveness comes in is by follow wrong things, then you must correct them, forgetting the past. Otherwise you will go on saying, "this person tortured me, that person tortured me. He was very mean to me. He was that to me. He did this to me." Shows that you are not of that calibre to understand Sahaja Yoga. be done. It is very wrong thing, you should Because you cannot forgive. What is there to but into a free life. Let them use their wisdom you must tell them, it is your duty. They were not born out of the trees but they were born here from the parents, so it is the duty of the parents to tell them that this is wrong and it should not correct them but that correction should be in a

 IX lssue: 9 & 10 1997 Divine Cool Breeze Volume 7. Sahaja way. I will tell you an example. I had a problem once with somebody coming to me and Sahaja Dharmis? Mother has established Sahaja saying "Mother, I cannot do without smoking. I have to smoke." I said "better smoke then, but you can't be a Sahaja Yogi because smoking Love which of course we have. But apart from Sahaja Yogi is a funny caricature, you know, I that we have so many other beautiful facets and can't think of a smoking Sahaja Yogi. How will I such beautiful things within our personalities, look if I start smoking like that?" "Ah! Horrible." I said then if you are my son, you cann't smoke, should be on your own qualities, on your own it looks bad." He gave up smoking. Can you personality and then you will be amazed how imagine? So dealing with your children always your personality is giving you joy, giving you make yourself an example. Yourself part and parcel of that example. So the children don't feel you know. This is something that I have t√§lked many a times. Children is onething, I tell they can give up everything but not your love. If they know you love them they will not accept weapons in this life time. Without weapons anything that will make you not love, not love things are solved what can you do. But them. This is for definite. Because children are the try to see the beauty as Sahaja Yogis. best people who know about love. Of course I don't know. I feel that in English language 1 been helped, how you have been guided, how didn't see many books about children written you have been blessed! This is Sahaja Dharma. If beautiful, beautiful things. There was one book that was published when I was in London. The low level. It is not the fault of Sahaja Yoga but it children talking about the politicians and they is your style. You are not sensitive. Supposing published I think 5,000 books and that very same somebody burns his hands, so what will you do? day it was finished. So talk to children. Talk to them you will be amazed they are full of honey, feel, he can drink, he can smoke, he can do they are such nice, nice things with them and everything and still he is existing alright. Must be when they talk like that then you are amazed how they say things, how they talk of Sahaja, we have to take example from other good Sahaja how they are expressing their spiritual strength. Yogis and not from the bad ones and how do we Now we have many very good children And also they are absolutely Sahaja. One boy came and he just prostrated himself before me. So I said, "Why trying to fax me. But also in the West another did you do it?" "O! I was getting cool vibrations Pproblem is they like to live in a hermatically from you mother, so I did it." "Is it, you like it?" "Of course" "More than chocolate" "Of course. "You eat them or what" "No need to it, you They don't want to drought. Drought is not know, you feel so happy inside and I feel, Mother, you are putting your hand on my in the fresh air at all. And that is another reason and trying to console me." I was surprised. I said, Where is your heart?" "Here! Here is my heart. I feel it here". You just imagine what love and suffocating life. Once I was in India. It was very what understanding of Sahaja Yoga for these little hot, somebody was driving me but the person children below even 5 years. Now you are all who was there was from Western country. He grown up children of mine. And I wanted to know all the beauties that are within you, that "why?" There is drought. I said "in this country, you have to enjoy. First of all learn to laugh at in India, people live in the open, what is yourself, that is the best way to enjoy yourself, drought?" "What drought you are talking now?" you know. And not to spend much time in the You couldn't open the door, you can't open the mirror, that is another way. If you spend too window, you could not open anything. If you much time in the mirror there is something open anything they will all be dead. So open. As wrong with you? I think personally that it is a kind of passion. You should see inside: Are we Dharma much more than what Krishna wanted to establish. He wanted to establish the Dharma of that we have forgotten to enjoy. So the attention Ahlad, giving you so much of patience with others. To me the whole thing looks like sometimes a joke, because nothing so serious. It is not a Rama's type that you have to be serious. I don't have to kill anybody. I don't use any you, if must you You should be sensitive to see how you have you cannot know that then you live on a very He has no sense, he has no sensitivity, he cannot Rakshasa. I think, I don't know what to say. So Proceed in enjoyment, which is an ocean just an ocean. For example now I came, everybody was sealed rooms, hermatically sealed cars. They are very afraid of draught. I don't know whether they will be thrown away, what will happen to them. coming from some iceberg. So they don't believe heart that people are very suffocating sometimes you know. They just suffocate. They are used to said "Don't open, don't open the window" I said it is about the nature also it is in their private

 Volume : IX Issue : 9 & 10 1997 Divine Cool Breeze Say in India, We see now what is happening in India. All corrupt, horrible this, that, so I said lives. They don't want to open. If somebody comes to their house "Oh my God. Now we will have to share the wines, will have to now share "alright if you don't like India why don't you go the food." They can not share. That is most uncollective. But in India I must say people have stay here. But this is a very corrupt government a good sharing capacity. Because they are still here, very bad." Anywhere you go you will find primitive. They are still primordial. They have not immediately they will see. Because you don't gone out of the way to satisfy their ego. But I think somehow or other in India, people like to share. If you want to please an Indian you tell them, "Tomorrow I will come and I'll have food with you." His wife will jump. She will say, "now what do you like?" "Tell me what food you like" She will jump. But otherwise what happens? As soon as you say "he is coming for food" the wife will say "No! I am going to my mother." Immediately she will have a program. I just don't understand. They will have beautiful houses, get that very deep feeling within you if you are very clean, very beautiful everything. But if Sahaja Dharmi. So this is a new Dharma we have somebody comes to their house they get a shock as if electricity has entered. So for whom is all this? To show off they will borrow money from Krishna's vision is coming true. He describes in the banks even Indians in America they do. They the beginning, I think he was not a good want to have, three Mercedes, four houses, for salesman, because he describes the best first, you what? Borrowing money, borrowing money they see the salesman first will start from 2 rupees and do it. Sahaja Yogis have not to borrow any money. There is no need. You can do away with these things, why to have so many cars? Nowadays people don't even walk at all. We used to go to our school. My father had a car, in India. Nothing doing. We had to walk. We used to climb one mountain. It was about 5 miles, this school, every morning; and in the evening, the questioner I think. So he starts asking questions car used to come. And I would walk with my bare feet. Because of so much vibrations and somewhere else." "No, No, No, No that we will know they are now chosen to change their country. I have taken up many questions now of India. I am going to start working on that level. We have already started in a way for the destitute women, then for other type, of poverty and all that. Just by saying remove poverty, poverty cannot be removed. You have to have feeling for the poor. Then only. But you get that feeling because you are an Indian. You are an Indian? So what? your own brothers, sisters, starving. You established now and this world a new race with a new Dharma which is much above. Even Shri go on to 2,000. But He first told us that you have to become 'Sthita Pragya' means Sahaja Yoga and when Shri Krishan was asked a question by Arjuna "What is the 'Sthita Pragya'?" Then he described the Sahaja Yogi. That is described beforehand. Second chapter is that. Then the question starts - Arjuna was a great "What about this, what about that? What about that?" He goes on explaining to him that you see this is all just a Maya. This is all an illusion now. Get out of this illusion once you get out of this illusion because Arjuna said "they are my him. He said, "How will I know who is your relations, they are my teachers, How can I kill them?" So Krishna said "nobody is killed" He her hand is the one you have to bring" so it is said, "Nobody is killed" But they are being killed to enjoy your nobility, to enjoy your generosity. because they are not following the Satya Dharma. It is very important. And not to side with any So it is alright. Who is your brother, who is your one. You are not identified with them. It is much sister? They are not following the Satya Dharma. So you have nothing to do with them. If you can correct them and guide them it is alright. Otherwise forget it." First deal with people who are straight. Like we should say that we must deal with people who are simple innocent and then you can take to difficult people when you are that good. Otherwise you will come here and Russians. They immediately start seeing what is say "Mother I have got this I have got that" So wrong with us and where do we lack in this. in Sahaja Dharma, you being the spirit, you also Because the collectivity of being in one country, know about others, very well. And you can make chappals I thought were cutting my vibrations. So I used to have chappals in my hands and walk. One day we had a new driver. My father sent daughter?" He said "any girl with chappals in better, now I think, because since you have taken to Sahaja Dharma. I have seen English will tell you what is wrong with English, Swiss will tell you what is wrong with Swiss. Indians will tell you what is wrong with Indians. Actually I learnt from them. I don't know these things are there. Russians will tell you what is wrong with

 Divine Cool Breeze Volume: IX Issue: 9 & 10 1997 You see love is something so great. It not only it out who is who, what chakras they are catching. But the trouble in America I found that helps others, it also helps you. It is so joyous to Sahaja Yogis used to just go and tell somebody give realization to others. But if you start telling you are catching on this chakra." They have come for the first time and you tell him "you, realizations? If you don't know how to give you are very egoistical" He said "How do you realization, better not do it. So to criticize is not know?" Your agnya is catching. May be his own agnya might be catching. Is this the way to pull legs of each other sometimes, just for fun's receive a new person? Is this the way to talk to sake. But not to harm, not to torture, not to make rnew person? See on the contrary you should that person fall. You are all Sahaja Dharmis, you Say "come, sit down. Very nice. You are very have accepted Sahaja Dharma and in Sahaja great" See because they are still ignorant so they Dharma we have to have, pure love of the heart like some sort of a buttering. Then gradually, not hypocrisy and sensible life. Now this pope is because you are doing this just to make him a Sahaja Yogi. Because you love him. Basically that suffering let her have abortion. The one who is is the reason. But as soon as somebody comes in living is more important than the one who is not if you tell him "this is wrong with you. That is living. If somebody wants to have abortion that wrong with you." This is not a pope's business where you go on telling people what is wrong with them. Go and confess to all the silly people. It is not that. What we have to show that vou beings. Like they say the muslim women are like have fallen in love with that person. You are nice to that person because you like that person. But as soon as he comes you give him one shock. So finished. How can you have good relations? Americans have to to learn this. I don't know "Your this Chakra is catching." why did you give the way we can enjoy life. Ahl of course you can f a woman is against abortion. I am not. If child can be born again. According to us nobody dies permanently. Whatever it may be. So this is one way they use it for propagation of human a factory. They go on producing more children, more children. So there are more voters. So the pope knows that; that is why he said "abortion no" Christians should not abort because then there will be less christians to compete with the why Americans think they are very superior muslims. But in Sahaja Yoga we don't have such people and I tell you for wisdom I would not say funny, radical, non-sensical things. We have they are not. They completely lack wisdom. And they misunderstand people very fast. Start important. To understand that these are all taboos judging others is not the way you can have which are there but not for people who have to Sahaja Dharma. Sahaja Dharma is you are in your own; you are in your own; you are in your own realm, in your happiness and joy. Where is the time to criticize others? So the best thing is to show divorce and we have also abortion which is get out of the troubles, we have to act and that is how it works. But to be very frank we don't have to do abortions. It is achieved by Parama Chaitanya. Parama Chaitanya does for me, I don't have to, I don't have to do anything. It is Parama your maximum love to everyone. In that love you should not show your pity but love Chaitanya, it is nice. Because it knows what is to which is again Ahladdayini. This is the message of Shri Krishna but I don't know how many understood it. Now what you find those who are following Shri Krishna, like the Hare Rama things will work out very well. So to understand people they are actually beggars on the street. He is Kubera and his disciples are beggers on the street. Can you imagine? Does it add to his glory you are giving to others. For that you have music as Kubera? be done. How to achieve. And sometimes you are in trouble, they know that you are not leaving things into the hands of the Parama Chaitanya. If you leave into the hands of Parama Chaitanya Sahaja Yoga first and foremost thing is how much you are enjoying yourself. How much enjoyment you have this, that. I was saying that today I So Sahaja Yogis are not like that. Should be won't speak much but somehow with Shri Krishna you cannot keep quiet. He played murli, Bansuri, flute. Look at him. I talk to you but he yourself. But think of the collectivity of yogis. just played murli. He didn't talk so much except Collectivity is not to bring forced people to come for a Geeta you won't find him talking. And to Sahaja Yoga. Once they come to Sahaja Yoga those who read also Geeta are horrible people I they will know the joy of life and you don't have tell you. Those who read Geeta they don't to tell them anything. Nothing has to be told. Just understand what is Shri Krishna's Dharma. If (contd. on page 16) generous. Should not bother too much about yourself. Should not all the time think about sit silently to work and they will feel your love.

 9 & 10 1997 Volume: IX Isue: Divine Cool Breeze 10 Talk by H.H. Shree Mataji Nirmala Devi To Unity International Foundation Hotel Claridges - Delhi 6.4.1997 (Synopsis) s far as efforts are concerned, people have Our country has been divided into 3 more done lots of research, lots of conferences countries, like Burma was a part of our country, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, also Bangladesh. Now if you and also they have tried to convince people that without unity we cannot exist. The go to these countries you will be surprised that reason is that, this world is one, we are all part they are in a mess. The people who fought, who and parcel of this world. But we are not wanted their freedom and separation, most of connected as we are in this body that even if you them wwere murdered get a pin prick the whole body knows about it. Rehman, Bhandaranaike, Bhutto. These are the Because, we are not awakened, our awareness is people who wanted to have the position, so they not such that you can feel this collective started saying we must have a separate state, awareness within yourselves. This collective separate identity. For whom it worked? But still awareness has been talked long time back, but they don't see the point, by getting separated not clearly. In the collective awareness what from the main line, how much they have happens is that the Kundalini, which is your own suffered! power, rises and as a result of that you become part and parcel of the whole and become aware of others and this we call as collective Ukraine people why have you separated from consciousness. To understand properly we must Russia? So to have this idea that we should have the experience of becoming one with the all- pervading power of Divine love. We have heard have not seen any country achieving any better. about it in the Bible, in the Quran. In all our Indian scriptures, it is described that there is a very subtle power which does all the work for us. Now few people believe that it exists and when 1 tell them they think it is something beyond our intellect, but you have to go beyond your mind. This mind of ours which we consider to be fast, I am myself amazed how things are very precious is just made by us through our ego and our conditioning. Mind is a myth because it is created by us and we play into the hands of our mind like we use our computers! Computer There were 2000 people sitting outside and 2000 has been made by us but it is ruling us. In the same way, this mind controls us and we also take people sitting inside the hall.I could not guidance from this mind which is a myth. If I say that, you should not be shocked, because you are very much identified with this mind, but I must tell you if this mind goes off the track, it doesn't matter I will come back. Then I talked to can make anyone mad. It can get identified with any person or stupid thing as something very useful. So it can lead human beings to wars, all kinds of things that will remove unity from our hearts. For example I was talking to someone who wanted to have a separate state. I said. sit on the stairs. You will be amazed, about 6000 "Why do you want to have a separate state?" He people came. Those who were inside, those who said, "then we can have two Prime Ministers." I Were outside, many others, I said how have you said, "why", because he wanted to become the prime Minister. Sheikh Mujeeb-ur- 1 have seen in Russia, now Bela Rousse is trying to come back in Russia and I asked the separate from one country to another country, I When you get your self-realization, then what happens that you develop within yourself a new dimension by which you feel the collective consciousness. You can feel on your finger tips, what is wrong with you and what is wrong with others. So, once that happens the unity comes so happening in Sahaja Yoga. I went to Russia,, I was shy of talking, but understand, how could these Russians take to me so easily. But they said what about us, we can't come inside this hall because it is full. I said it them and all of them got realization. I came out they were still sitting there. They said what about us, I said alright, come tomorrow I will be there in the morning. In Russia we have lots of big beautiful gardens so I said you better come, I will taken to me? What have I done for you? What makes you think that I can give you something

 Volume: IX ISUD: 9 & 10 1997 Divine Cool Breeze 11 special? They said its so obvious. I was surprised you know yourself, you cannot know God. You at their sincerity and 1 found Russians, also other should know yourself, there should be self- Eastern block people are extremely sensitive. One knowledge and this knowledge takes you beyond of the reasons for their sensitivity is perhaps your mind and beyond science. because they feel that they were oppressed or whatever it is, but the thing is, they have lost first of all it is amoral. There is no morality and their sense of conditioning. They are not possessive. They were told by the government that you can take your flats and live there vou don't feel anything because it is immoral. happily. They said no, no we don't want flats. They have no sense of possession at all. Their's is a clean slate. Another thing, they do not have any conditioning because they were not told artificially practice something like a moral about any religion, they were not told about God, such people can become extremely dry and also about all these things which are creating hot tempered. It should come from within that problems in our country. I was so surprised that these people took to Sahaja Yoga so easily, in the spirit. You are not this mind, you are not this next program that I had, there were 10,000 people. It was amazing. I don't know Russian language. They were so sweet and so nice and should become. Becoming is the point. If you there we had a program of 250 scientists. I must become that then you will be amazed how great say Russia has developed science in such a subtle manner, they have very great scientists and they conscious but also you become a fountain of all were there and I started telling them about science. If 1 start on something else, I thought it happens, you cannot bring unity e.g. now I have won't be so good, so let uS start on science. One of them got up and said, Mother we have had enough of science, can you please tell of the science of the Divine. One thing I have noticed about them is that they are really very all with several hippies, gradually it grew into introspective. I asked them, are they worried such a sweet thing that we could get into Russia, about the coup that is happening in Moscow? into Eastern block, all the European countries, we They replied why should we worry, we are in the Kingdom of God. Intellectual people have their brains very much gains that from South America, he says what with their thoughts and their ideas. Somebody about South America? When are you coming to meets one type of a person, he becomes very South America? We need you very much there. right-sided. Another meets another type he When I went there I found there were so many becomes identified. You go and listen to seekers, they were not interested in power, somebody's lecture, that lecture goes into your head, so all the time your brain is covered, all the time by these outside items which are not yours. Unless and until they are your experiences, they Russia, there 25 Germans came to Moscow. I said are not clear. To get that experience is very easy. how are you here, they were Sahaja Yogis. They Of course our country is a country of great Yoga, said. Mother, don't you think that we Germans I must say. Even in China when I went there they have killed so many Russians, don't you think came and asked me, Mother is this the treasure of our rich Chinese? Treasure of spirituality is India. They have read about it, they know about it, they are just waiting to get something out of us but here I find not that much. Here we have gentle that you won't believe that they have no time to pay attention to ourselves, to know anything of Hitler in them. yourself which is told by every one. Christ has said, Mohammed Sahib has said, unless and until Germans, they went to Israel. I said why did you Science as you know has its own limitations, so with science you cannot go any further, you can kill people, you can destroy countries and Now morality doesn't mean outside restriction but it means compassion, love, pure love, you understand what is to be done. But if you you should know that you are nothing but a pure ego, this emnotion but beyond that you are the pure spirit. Even knowing is not enough, you you are. Not only that you become collectively love and compassion. Unless and until that been working in Sahaja Yoga which I would not call government level, or in any way official level. I never tried to disturb my husband's office or anything, but I just started on my owrn. First of went to America and to South America. Because, just people felt that. See because if one person money, nothing-just seeking. Now, I must tell you a sweet story, twice they have shown their sweetness. First when I went to that its our duty that we should come and give them what we have got? Such love and such compassion! These Germans are so soft and so Then they went, Austrians, they are also

They Mooladhara, this chakra is made of carbon atoms. said Mother, the thing is that we felt very Now if you take a look at carbon atoms what you responsible for these Israelis, Jews, because so many have been killed in our country and we from left to right it looks just like Omkara, the cannot forgive ourselves and so we have to do same thing looks like Omkara but if you see from something about it. Imagine Germans knowing down upwards, you will see alpha and omega. Israelis and talking to them and caught hold of Christ has said, I am the alpha, I am the omega some young people say about 30 or so. But I was amazed that I asked the Israelis, I said how are be proved. Another thing is that, once you get you here? They said why not, we want to make your self-realization you start feeling cool breeze friends with Muslims, so we have to be here. I coming out of your hands and you can feel the said very good idea. Automatically, they are all pervading power all around you. Now with working out this unity. I don't tell them, they just this thing you can say that what centres you are do it on their own understanding. What is needed catching because there are seven centres on the is an inner understanding, inner unity not right hand, seven centres on the left hand. You outside. This is what is that we human beings are can easily feel on your finger tips the different capable of doing tremendous thing if we fall into the ocean of compassion and we do it in such a sweet manner that you can't believe that they are human beings, that they have gone absolutely with them. If you take about 10 children, tie up beyond the limitations of human life. The other day I read a news about a somebody before them ask the boys, what is he gentleman who was saying that I am going to catching, they all raise one finger, all of them the start a Jihad. For what? To get rid of all the same, because it is absolute knowledge. Suppose immorality they have in the West and all sorts of they raise the index finger, something wrong with things, the drinking and all other things. So one Sahaja Yogi telephoned to me that Mother what not spoken, how do you know? I said it is is the need to do Jihad for all that, just do Sahaja communicated by this knowledge, through this Yoga, you will get rid of all these things. We all were drunkards, we all were doing all sorts of nonsensical things, we were doing immoral of false gurus, some of them, really have come things, you don't have to do Jihad for that, you out making big money and especially they take just get it yourself. So much clean and so much above all that all things, in Sanskrit we call it has big position and they approach them. These 'Upadhi', they just fall of, it happens. I assure people actually you can find them out on your you it can happen to you also, its nothing special, fingertips. Because if anybody is like that, you because this Kundalini when it rises, it does work just start feeling. It is written in the Quran that out. She is your own Mother, she knows your fingers will speak, that your hands will everything about you and the way she gives you speak at the time of 'Qayama' at the time of your second birth is very good, you all are capable of getting it, especially Indians. We have yourself and others. Supposing you know how to so many 'sufis', like lotuses they have come out and the rest is still the same. Now, we have to understand that we Indians are born in this great country of Yoga because of our previous life. The problem is that we are not taking advantage of spiritual being. So you can; and that's the the Yoga Bhumi, which is in your power and can personality where we have a complete human give you all the blessings of the Divine.

I said alright, then we had a program and so many became Sahaja Yogis and then we are amazed that how in Rome, how there used to be like Sufis, they suffered so much many thousands are there who are Sahaja Yogis. and then running to one unit in turkey, one in Like this Sahaja Yoga started spreading, not by Tunisia and one everywhere. I went to Tunisia, I me so much but by people who went from here to see.

It is amazing that there are 400 Sahaja Yogis in just change completely the panorama of your one city of Africa. Now what they are doing just collecting more, more and more of Sahaja amazed. What has happened to this gentleman, Yogis and that's how they are working. This is what it is that, if you are wanting to have peace of mind, this is what you call a Mother's temptation, Pralobhan' as they call it. personality, the human personality as described in The Mother says alright take your medicine, then I will give you a chocolate. In the same way you can say, if you really want to have peace of mind, twice. Now once you become one with the if you really want to have unity, it will work out. It is a very great 'Vidya' as I told you in the very the word, it is not like you put a sign board - beginning and if you have this Vidya', Sahaja I am born again'. But if you are born again you Yoga will work very fast because that's the only have a power and the greatest power is that you way in which you can get natural, spontaneous, love and you enjoy your love. This power works. inborn love between people. We have programs every year, every month. We have a program in tell her story. She met me because she was a very far fetched place called Ganpatipule. There working with the U.N. in New York and she got people come from all over the world, some are rich, some are poor. We don't have much Yoga. Then she retired and went to Mexico and arrangements there, you see, for these people her son was stuIdying, very. very young. She because we don't have much money. Whatever it wrote to me "Mother there is some disease which is but they come there, they are put wherever only very few people in my family get when they there is a place, they enjoy themselves. I said don't you think it is uncomfortable, they said and then they get this disease but they are very Mother we are just seeking the comfort of the old, they just die when they get this. But spirit because spirits are so comfortable. They unfortunately my son has got it, he is a young don't bother me, it's not good or that is not good, boy and I don't know what to do." So I started nothing. Just they enjoy that, you should see the wondering what I should do, I was just putting way all the nationalities enjoy themselves. Such a peaceful understanding, such a beautiful flow this, second came, in the third one she was of I never knew there could be so many Sahaja Yogis, I could never understand because only I or 2 here and was amazed how people got their realization and because you develop a witness state by which this helps you to understand yourself better.

All these petty "Mother I am amazed, my son is completely things like rivalry, competition, all this drops off. cured." Its not a miracle, it looks like that but so They have no liking for all this because they have many patients have been cured. So many have already become saints and this is said by so many changed their lives through Sahaja Yoga. So that these are men of God and they become the curing is just a Pralobhan' as you call or a inheritors of the Divine love.

All this has been described by great seers human being which then treats the inner energy and saints like Markandeya, Adi Shankaracharya, centres, or chakras, automatically.

A cool breeze flows out of your fingertips and out of the top of your head and this is described in most of the scriptures. You are not left in the dark, but you can feel the centres in you, which are in jeopardy, on your fingertips and in your body. Also you can feel others' centres. If you know how to cure your centres you can cure others' also, for which you do not have to pay. It is a living process of evolution so you do not have to pay for This unique method is not against science. What civilization western western or consumerism has done is given us blind progress but with Sahaja Yoga you can achieve progress of the real kind because there is light. This way Russia will become a land of real morality and inner spirituality capable of leading the world into the twenty-first century. Congratulations to all Russians. (contd. from page 9) they don't understand Shri Krishna how they will understand Sahaja Yoga. So for all of you is to practice on love, on forgiveness, on appreciating others, on giving joy to others. Some of the Sahaja Yogis have been very kind to me. Once I went to the shop to buy a saree for myself. The saree was very expensive for my purse. So I didn't buy. So let it "this colour suits me alright but does not matter." I didn't have so much money to buy. So that Sahaja Yogi bought that saree and on my birthday gave me and really I could not see it because my eyes were filled with tears. Just a small thing like that. Normally I do not expect you to do anything for me. No. But small, small things make me so happy. But even if you, do this to somebody he may not understand, may not realize, may not feel it. But if you are a Sahaja Yogi you will. So thank you very much for all this that I have said to you, try to enjoy yourself and make others enjoy you. May God bless you. =

The collective state "collective energy" -is important for keeping new people. Dynamic energy, love and collectivity is what generates the collective energy. Various points were mentioned: After the 14-week course there are seven more sessions which provide more details about the chakras. It is important to remember the auspiciousness of putting up posters of Shree Mataji. Each poster is an act of worship. In India sometimes they even put kumkum on the poster when hanging it-like a Puja. The yogis have a responsibility for the new people. New people are lost due to stupid things such as the yogis' lack of maturity and desire. The details at the programs are important. The yogis must know what to say and how to behave in front of new people. In Colombia they are now doing a ten-week series on the 10 Gurus in which they emphasize the basic message of each Guru. Many people are getting realization. Recently there were 230 people at programs in Barranquila, Colombia and 100 at the follow-ups. This many people came from -only putting 30 posters for the first program! Now 25 are still staying. And recently in Bogota 500 people came to a public program and now 200 are staying on for the follow-ups. New people take varying amounts of time to establish. It is different for everybody-some may take two weeks, others two years. Some of the first Brazilian yogis got realization and went to India right away. They came up very Other key points for public programs were discussed : . It is essential to clarify key terms and definitions.

They need to know who is ready and when they are ready. . The people are seeking but there needs to be more dedication and more attention on the new people by the yogis. The yogis must make time and be available to communicate with the Always the yogis must have open hearts to the new people. Everyone can watch and see how to help the new people. The leader can help by assigning different yogis to help particular groups of new people. It is most important to remember that Divine new people. The yogis need to establish a relationship with the new people and support them. The yogis need to develop their own qualities. They need to manifest sincere love for people-the capacity to give peace and joy. discretion is vibrations. The new people need to feel their sincere love. The need to get a feeling of security. Mahatma Gandhi was quoted to emphasize an important point. A journalist asked Mahatma Gandhi, "What is your message?" Mahatma Our devotion to Shree Mataji must show. This is the most important thing. Gandhi replied, "My message is my life." Javier, now living in Bolivia, spoke of things that happened while he was living in Italy. Many changes have been initiated in Italy.

The sun was shining upon us, filtered by leaves of the surrounding trees. A warm, gentle breeze blew. We looked up to see a wide, blue sky, the soothing sounds of nature helping to settle the attention upon the spirit. It is so quiet in the country. This is one of the reasons it is so conducive in helping us touch our own inner silence. The program was held in a hotel with a seating capacity of not more than 100 people as a big response was not expected because it was a long holiday weekend. To our amazement the hall was full, with more than 30 new people in attendance. The program started with the leader of Austria welcoming the guest of honour, Ms.Lata Reddy. He then gave a very touching At the conclusion of the puja Uncle John Henshaw thanked our hosts on behalf of us all. He spoke of the national and international feeling speech as to why we as Austrians were of brotherhood and union that this event had established, due in no small part to the hospitality and warmth showered upon us by the Brisbane collective. This puja provided a boost to the Brisbane collective as well as to everyone who celebrating India's Independence Day. He narrated how Her Holiness Mataji Shree Nirmala Devi brought us close to this great land of Bharat the Yoga Bhoomi of this world through the process of Sahaja Yoga. He explained how Sahaja Yoga had given us inner independence from all those things that make us dependent. This was participated. He concluded by saying that he is looking also the dream of Mahatma Gandhi's Swatantrata forward to the opportunity of the Victorian collective welcoming the national collective to celebrate Diwali Puja later this year at a venue near the Victoria/New South Wales border. movement. After the talk, a praise to the Mother, H√© Adi Ma was sung, followed by small excerpts from the film Gandhi. We relived the historic moments of the independence struggle in this film. Then an Indian brother spoke about Shree Mataji's contribution to India's independence struggle.

To add to the joyful tempo of the evening we sang a few devotional Sahaja bhajans and Qawwalis. Our new Indian brother whom we met in the morning sang a beautiful Indian folk song from Gujarat, the birth place of Gandhiji. The function concluded with the presentation of a small gift, Sir C.P.

Golden Words
he message of God has come to mankind in the golden words of the great prophets and incarnations.
The first known message was given by Lord Krishna to Prince Arjuna on the battlefield of Mahabharata
known as the 'hitupdesh' or the Gita. But this was an advice given exclusively to Arjuna in the context of
his mental blocks and the need of the situation. 5000 years later Lord Jesus Clrist preached the gospel of love
and forgiveness to mankind which was compiled long after his crucification called the Bible. In the 6th century
the Prophet Mohammad had visions of God's message which he narrated to his wife. 40 years after his death
these teachings were consolidated as the Holy Koran by a remote follower. These were the prime sources of
God's communication to mankind. The turbulances of History marred by papal manipulations no doubt blurred
the lustre of these golden words.
Fortunately, in modern times the Divine herself has incarnated as Her Holiness Mataji Shree Nirmala Devi to
communicate directly with all humanity for its en masse ascent. But do we listen? Do we listen to only what we
want to hear. Often we quote only that which suits our convenience "Mother said this...".
Each golden word is a mantra to be read again and again, to introspect and to imbibe. She is not speaking for
others, she is speaking to each one of us. It is a common hallucination that she is saying it for others and not for
LIS.
No incarnation studied human beings and their problems so minutely and deeply as she does. Hence when
she speaks the vibrations flow to work out the problem. If we listen with rapt attention and absorb each word, it
will work out like a mantra at every chakra. This is Divine Vani' which feels, loves and acts. It is all powerful
and all pervading. Yes, when she speaks every word falls like pearls into the ocean. It is Divine music that
elevates us to celestial heights and blesses us with ambrosia.
Often our intellect tries to argue with what she says. Our own idea, convictions, mental jargans and
conditionings start projecting immediately. But we should question ourself, "who are we and what is so important
about what we think and say." It is only a mental projection of our programming like a computer throwing out
information based on its floppy programme. Therefore wisdom lies in realising our limitations and shortcomings
and recognise the truth. The truth is that we are the Spirit, not this body, mind intellect or ego. So why identify
and support falsehood against absolute truth whcih is her Divine message.
The human intellect tends to find excuses or offer explainations, but of what use are they and to whom. By
playing games with ourself we only deceive ourself and hasten towards our doom. Christ warned, "those who
are not with me are against me" Nor is there any room for any half hearted commitments, for that will only
produce half baked yogis. Hence we cannot mellow down her words for then they would cease to be golden..
In this Blossom time what a golden opportunity is at hand, golden words of the Divine are being compiled in the
eternal scripture of Divine Cool Breeze", Let us wear them close in our hearts and flow with the Divine Cool
Breeze.

After the 14-week course there are seven more
sessions which provide more details about the

It is important to remember the auspiciousness
of putting up posters of Shree Mataji. Each
poster is an act of worship. In India sometimes
they even put kumkum on the poster when
hanging it-like a Puja.
The yogis have a responsibility for the new
people. New people are lost due to stupid
things such as the yogis' lack of maturity and
desire. The details at the programs are
important. The yogis must know what to say
and how to behave in front of new people.
In Colombia they are now doing a ten-week
series on the 10 Gurus in which they emphasize
the basic message of each Guru.
