内在灵的力量的达致

印度Rahuri 1984年2月26日

我希望你们到目前为止和往后的旅程都很舒适。舒适的源头是你的灵。当你的灵感到越舒适,外在的问题便不再重要了。你不会介意住在那里、睡在那里、吃什么、做什么。当这些粗糙的感官消失,你内在的精微感觉便会生长。这就是为什么你们要来到这里,你们在这里克服时间、克服各种制约等等。我是指那些你死我活的竞争,这些竞争必须完全停止,决断地停止,「外在(without)。」所以在这里我们可以以「外在」的态度来作事。当你开始静坐,这个「内在(within)」也可以做到,你们可以达至和平,那是所有人类必须拥有的,若我们想从毁灭中把地球拯救出来,必须要有和平。

你必定已经意识到,霎哈嘉瑜伽现在发展得很快,以很恰当的速度前进。我们必须保持装备完备,令自己可以在即将横扫全世界的伟大进化和改革过程中,成为其中一份子。

为此,我们要承担起我们的工作,不要过平凡的生活,平凡的思维,这是非常重要的。我们都是极有潜质的人。还有,神的神性力量都在祝福我们。尝试运用这个在你内里的力量,与这个力量合一。渐渐地,你必须看到你重重的打击你的身体、你的头脑、你的自我,把它们雕琢得很漂亮,令你成长成你本来被创造的模样。

至于其他事情,像我来到你的国家,我视我为你做最好的事情,就是当你来到「这个」国家时,令你感到你是属于这个国家,你像从其化国家连根拔起。当你来到这里,你是那么昌盛。在这个国家,我是那么努力,幸勤地工作,做各样的事情,我的时间全花在与你们一起,不分白天昼夜,全时间的做每样事情。在这里,当我看到发生在你身上的事情时,我感到不可能成就太多事情。在这里,你对这神圣的地方感到絶对放松。我想这种把你从别的国家连根拔起的想法必须放弃。我想就像你已经移居到这些国家,回到自己的本性一样,但却并未被移民法例所发现。

在这种情况下,我们必须改变策略,开始在这里建立我们的静室,我们的工作计划,所以你们必须来到这里,成就更多事情。你可以在这里赚取你的生活。但你必须来到这里,连续花两至三个月,建立自己,令自己成长。因为我没有想过在这里可以成就得这样好,因为我们已经尝试了各种方法,所以这是我们这旅程最后的成果。

尽管我们在这里的旅程和生活,充满着各式各样的危险,你们做得非常好。我必须说,当我看到你们时,我感到你们都很好,改善了很多。就像手表,为了令你们对它有免疫力,你把他们放在荒谬的条件,他们变得没有问题。就像这样,现在你有了免疫力。他们被放在槽里,彻底地被摇晃。正如你们昨天那样,在巴士上被摇晃。跟着,他们被制造成让水可以很快在他们身上流过。所有这些在这里也被尝试。我想你的免疫系统,对外在事物的反应,成长得很快。你们变成真正坚固永恒的个体,就如在这里创造你们一样,我非常高兴看到你们的进展,这是我们来到这里,已经达致的主要成果。

首先,注意力必须远离金钱。钱是其中一个最大的问题。实际上,没有人会相信,富裕的国家的人比印度人更金钱取向,虽然他们已经那样发达。你看,那些发达国家的人比印度人更金钱取向,那是非常令人惊讶!当你看到他们是怎样数算一分一毫,你是不能相信,他们真的是已经成长的人吗。有时,他们比乞丐更坏。所以你必须远离金钱。金钱是人们数算的可怕的东西,我的意思是数算神的名比数算钱好_______可怕的钱币。

还有,我们对其他事物如对舒适有表面的执着。我并不认为这里过的是舒适的生活,因为在这里,你随时要在晚上任何时间迁移。你不会遇见任何会夺取你的钱包或你的手镯的人。你可以以你喜欢的行径移动,没有人会骚扰你。你不会遇见两或三个酒鬼互相殴打,不会有这类事情发生。所以这里的生活是很纯朴。这是很大的成就。

若你想过那种你想过的舒适,你可以迟一点自己创造。我个人认为,太现代化并不适合这个地方。所以,令自己身体变成舒适的奴隶和奴役人这些无用的观念,必须不要灌输给他们。

在任何情况下,个人的卫生在这里是很好的,但大众的卫生必须向那些人讲授。这种施予和接受的过程,我肯定必会运作得很好。还有事情在你内里正在运作。我有很大的愿望,希望你来到这个国家,居住一段时间之后,再回到自己的国家,你真的成长得更快。这比只有我探访你的国家还好,有时我感到探访你的国家,只是被负面能量轰炸。

另一点我要告诉你,你必须明白,你来到这里,必须有些得益。没有人会在你身上得到任何好处,所以你必须在这里获得某些益处。你是学生,所以你必须学到一些东西,尝试发展纪律的意识。就像一个门徒,吸收四周所有一切_______这是什么?这是怎样?这是房子,那很美好。就像这样。但若你继续看些并不重要的事物,随意说些与你无关的说话,所有这些必须放弃。因为你有太多时间,所以人们坐下,与你交谈,说些无聊、难聴、无用的说话,不需要这样。相反,还是保持沉默比较好,吸收更多自己的内里。因为在这里,人们没有时间,他们不能交谈,他们需要工作。但当你有时间,你便开始说些无聊的说话,这是非常错误的事情。

另一种谈话是与自己,也说得太多。像你开始分析、批评,找别人错处,不停的想..「啊!这样会比较好。我伤害这里太多......这种事情已经发生...。」所有这样的事情进入你的脑海,这种与自己说的话也必须停止。耶稣基督称他们为喃喃终日的灵,祂还说..「小心喃喃终日的灵。」但喃喃终日的灵存在于我们内里,所以小心它们,不要听信所有荒谬的言论,要保持警觉,这样便能帮助你。整体上,我必须说这个旅程和之前的旅程,我都感到极大的喜乐,非常高兴这些旅程可以为我带来那么多不可能发生但却发生了的事情,亦把你的潜能带到我面前,我为此感到很高兴。无论如何,在这一年,在我们之间,已经形成了一种新的气氛,那就是谦卑、宁静、和平,吸收神性,对我来说,那是非常非常伟大,喜乐的东西。

我非常多谢所有这些,我希望你们可以保持这样的进度。

愿神祝福你们。

Translation from Marathi:

Now I thank the Sahaj yogis of India on behalf of everyone that they did all the work peacefully, not infighting with each other, not landing anyone in the soup, not causing anyone embarrassment, not showing any anger, and doing everything sensibly and setting a good example in front of them (foreigners). They think that you are very great men, devotees of God, wise, having a nice and balanced life, and are extremely moral. This means in short everyone thinks you are Shivaji Maharaj, and to such Shivaji Maharajas, you all, I bow to you.

Now I have to tell you that in us sometimes it so happens that words and deeds do not match, because we have so many ideals here that hypocrisy enters into a man. We put up a pretence of being very nice, which these people cannot see through, as they are straightforward people. They have nothing concealed in them, which goes to such an extent that we will say they are shameless, but in them whatever is there, it is visible to everyone. They don't keep any malice in their hearts, but in us this art is very advanced. So we show ourselves as very great to others, but inside we have many defects. So, we will be harmed in this case. When we talk to people, we say such things that people will feel God Almighty has himself descended on this earth, but if we look closely at their character or their life, then we feel that there is no bigger demon than them. And demons like these have gone abroad and swindled these people (foreigners). These people outwardly talk very sweetly, very nicely and act as if they are extremely innocent and loving, and after going abroad they have fleeced all their (foreigners’) money, made them hungry, destroyed their state, and they got respect and honour abroad. Then we all have a little bit of this quality that we can manage being outwardly very nice and be different inside.

These people (foreigners) cannot do this even if they want to. They even ask Me, "But he says he is so nice. So how can it be? I mean, if someone is a bad person among us then he will state clearly, ‘I am a bad man. I am cruel’.” So I said, “We don't do this. If we say this we will get a beating. So we do not tell. Instead, they say, ‘I am extremely good.’ Even if he is an extremely cruel demon he will say, ‘I am extremely nice and a great man,’ but what he is inside, he will not say. I mean, we do not feel the responsibility to admit what we are inside.”

But in Sahaja yogis, outside and inside there is no difference. We should be the same outside and inside. The man who becomes the same outside and inside, ander baaher ek hi Janu, who has no difference in his thoughts and deeds, is a true saint. Outside and inside. If I tell you not to drink and I Myself sit drinking, then what will you say? This is a simple example, but if I am an Indian then I will drink in secrecy and tell everyone not to drink, and I will drink in secrecy. This is the Indian style. And the English style is telling you that drinking alcohol means you are going towards God. I am drinking, so you also drink. This is the style of the English or foreigners’ style. But both the styles are wrong. In their style even if we say everything is exposed, still it is foolishness, and even if we conceal everything nicely, we are really not as nice as we seem. We should keep this in mind. If we are surrendered to God, God helps us. He blesses us with innocence by which we cannot put up fake pretences. Where is the wisdom in pretending to ourselves? There is no meaning in it. By the fear of society or for the sake of show, we show we are ideals and we are nice. This gives one the impression that in society evil does not spread much, but by that egoistic behaviour and hypocrisy we are never going to benefit. So why don't we benefit ourselves? We should think like this, that by doing goodness and good deeds they will benefit us.

Now people of old times used to say that saints always had trouble, and they always had grief. What happiness did they get from God? They faced so many crises, and the rest of the people lived in happiness. But in a way if we look at it, no one was happy. So, let’s look around. We see lots of people who seem happy, people who are rich, people in power, people who have huge empires, but if you look closely, no one is unhappier than them. They are in deep misery. If I tell you their grief, it is as big as mountains, and they are crushed under it. They are as good as mad. They don't understand what to do. They do an injustice and then they feel bad about it. It must be so! If someone hurts anyone, then it returns back to him. The torturing hand also suffers. So they are in great grief. If they are cruel to anyone, then that cruelty affects them also.

We went to see those people who think they are very rich and very prosperous to their home. The day before yesterday I was in Pune. There is a gentleman who is very rich. He invited me to his house. About two or three years back, his wife and his son were very big alcoholics, and his daughter-in-law was on the verge of having tuberculosis. They were facing such a big calamity, but her husband was a drunkard and they had lots of money. The woman could not give up alcohol, come what may. She was like big-time alcoholics, and they were so prosperous that you cannot even imagine. So he told Me, "Mataji, I will give you lots of money. Please cure my wife." I said, “I don't need any money. I will cure your wife.” And you will be surprised to know that the day before yesterday both the son and his mother came. They had quit drinking completely and were completely normal. The rich man said, "Mother, I do not want this money. Due only to this money all the grief and penury has come into my house. All this trouble has only come from money. This is the true penury in the sense that I have so much money with me but I have no support from my wife and my son, and my daughter-in-law was falling ill. So this is true penury that I had. So I do not want this money. You put this money anywhere. Put this to good use. I don't want this money."

Other rich people whom I saw, some were caught up with false gurus, some were caught somewhere else, and there were misery and illness in their homes. Someone started running after money. So he went to the races where he lost everything, blah, blah. He ditched his wife and children and he kept women, began drinking and all this happens. This means that if we look at someone and say, “See how successful he is,” tomorrow if he falls from grace he will be lying on the road for days and no one will look at him. People say to him, “When you were in power you behaved like this. So now we do not care for you.” His aura of power is also gone. I mean, now there is also no meaning in his power. In this way, whatever we say makes a person successful, but when a person gets it, he is not happy. Have you ever seen a drunkard being garlanded after his death? We never hear, “He was such a big drunkard. Let's build his statue,” or “This person was very cruel. He ill-treated everyone, but he was in power. Let's build his statue.” Have you seen this anywhere? There is no statue of Hitler anywhere, one who was very well-regarded at one time and did so much cruelty. There is no statue of him anywhere. This means that the person who lives a bad life will never get recognition ever. So, superficially we may feel that he became so big and successful for the time being, but if we look with foresight, that man never gets peace.

So, after this we must understand that true prosperity is in attaining your spirit. But now this Mahayoga that is started, at the time of this Mahayoga we are going to get true prosperity in every way, as this time all the seven chakras have come on Sahasrara. As all the seven chakras have joined on Sahasrara, due to their integration we get the Laxmi principle. Similarly, we get the principle of Bhramadev, meaning all kinds of creativity will come to you, and you will start writing poetry. Also, if we are afraid of something or we are facing some loss or someone is attacking us, then all that attack is negated, and if someone still attacks us then he is destroyed. Such a situation will come. You should try to attain this level.

After that, at the level of Vishuddhi is the place of Shri Krishna. There you will get complete Kshema (wellbeing). As Krishna has said, “I will give you Kshema. If you get your yoga, I will give you Kshema.” All kinds of Kshema means beginning with good physique and a glow on the face. The whole life of the person blooms like a lotus. He gets the witness state, peace and mastery like Shri Krishna. He can do with people as he pleases and put them on the right track. He gets a kind of authority and sovereignty.

After that, on coming to Agnya chakra he gets a reservoir of forgiveness. He is not hurt by anyone or anything. He forgives everyone. Nothing sticks to him. Whatever anyone says to him or if anyone hurts him, he forgives. And this forgiveness has so many powers, it’s as if forgiveness forms a big mace and goes and puts that man in his place who had hurt him. I mean, either that man is corrected or he is destroyed. I mean, you have so big a blessing of Agnya chakra. Also on Agnya chakra are Ekadasha rudra, meaning that those people who have ill-treated you or troubled you, their Ekadasha gets caught up and they are destroyed. This means on one side you are nurtured, and you get love, growth and protection, while on the other side those who try to hamper your growth are completely destroyed. This is the magic of Sahaja Yoga today. This means it is the work of the seven chakras.

Then, Sahasrara being My place, those who reach Sahasrara and establish themselves, once their Sahasrara opens up, are blessed with Mother's love in all ways, and whatever is sweet and fruitful in it, they get all the kinds of its tastes. Man feels truly blessed. He becomes aware that he is completely secure and he swims in the ocean of joy. His powers increase tremendously, and people give him recognition. A lot of people who have never spoken publicly become big and famous speakers. They develop oratory skills and they give realization to lots of people. In this way, the world is getting a new leadership which was predicted fourteen thousand years ago. So, this is the time to make true the fourteen-thousand-year-old prediction, and whatever has to be done is to be done only by your hands. You will be such big people that you have a place on My Sahasrara, you are sitting in My Sahasrara, and a lot of work will be done by your hands. And to do the work we need capabilities. We need to give up pretences, quit being hypocrites, stick to truth, be straightforward. We should ignore small things and look at the bigger picture. We should not get upset with each other, nor get angry or distressed with each other, and one must be humble and shine in one’s own glory. Even if only this is done, it is a lot. Everything is in your own hands, everything is near you, everything is given to you by God Almighty. So, it's not like something special has to happen. It is a very simple thing to happen, and it is already predicted that it will manifest. You only need to stand in this holy Ganges. Keeping your legs close to each other, nicely you need to stand your ground. If you manage this a little, everything can be done. In this way once Sahaja Yoga spreads, everyone is going to be blessed by it.

So I bless you that you get those benefits and you bloom in it. My infinite blessings to you.

May God bless you all.

May God bless you all.
