[English Transcript]

Shri Mataji: First you must get realised. Then you will know who is the real guru; who is not. But as a Mother, I would say, you have a guru [UNCLEAR] why are you keeping a guru? Minimum. Any mother would say, “Baba, what is the use having the guru, when your health is not all right. Also, you have a guru and you are [UNCLEAR]. Then what’s the use of having such a guru? So there is something wrong, either with the guru or with yourself.

So the best thing is - that first of all we must get in the position in the [UNCLEAR/state] by which we ourselves can know who is right and who is wrong. Who is real, who is unreal. These days these gurus are available everywhere. You know that. Anybody calls himself a guru. I mean, in [UNCLEAR] name, especially in Calcutta, everybody says, “I am he. I am he. I am he”. Arre baba, if you are [UNCLEAR/“this”], all right. What speciality have you got that is [UNCLEAR/distinct]? What did you get as this personality? What, are you different from others, or you have in one way become a fundamentalist?

Then some will say, “I am Jain”. “I am Christian”. “I am Hindu”. “I am Musalman”. What is the difference between a Musallman and a Hindu? If there is a difference, fine. Except one will put the clothes this way and the other will put the clothes that way. One would shave their hair; another will not shave their hair. What is the basic difference between people, I don’t know.

Somebody says we follow Buddha. But what is the enlightenment you have got from Buddha? Buddha has said the future Buddha has to come. Bodhisattva. Means you will become Buddhas and you will be doing the work with people. You will be doing “kalyan” (welfare) of others. That is Bodhisattva.

What powers have you got following any guru? “I am a follower, Mother, of that guru, I am a seeker”. Why are you a seeker? Why are you a follower of that guru? Better give up all such gurus, I would say [UNCLEAR]. You should have your free mind - just now, for the time being.

Also, it is said that we must have a guru. Every [UNCLEAR] thinks you should have a guru. But you should be a “satguru” (true guru). Somebody comes out of a cave and wears a “kasha vastra” (ochre robe) - everybody starts following. Even women, when they are possessed, they say, “ I am Durga Mata” and everybody falls at their feet. I mean, it is an absolutely brainless thing. Imagine Durga Mata coming in a maidservant. Is it possible? I mean, imagine. All these tantrikas, this, that - I mean Bengal is poor because of this “kali vidya” (black magic). And these useless gurus. That’s the reason the poverty comes in.

The day you remove these shackles from your eyes and get your realisation, you will see how [UNCLEAR/it works]. I do not want to go into [UNCLEAR] or [UNCLEAR], because it is a very long list. They are right here. Best thing is you become your own guru. Why do you need a guru? You become your own guide. In the light of the Spirit, you can guide yourself. You don’t want any guru outside yourself.

But first have faith that you can become a guru. Also sometimes this gurudom business comes out of insecurity and fear. That, “My guru will look after me”. Why? You should look after yourself. If you have decided that, “I will stand on my legs”, you will have Self-realisation. Take it from Me. Don’t have to depend on anyone. Just you have to surrender your ego completely, that’s all.

This ego is really standing in between. And this image that you see here; they will show you - you can see the ego part. Can you see that yellow, like our [UNCLEAR]? And this ego is the one that even covers the superego, our conditionings. And when it covers that, we are gone. Hard nuts. Nobody can talk to them. They are just these convex people. It just goes into their head and comes back. But what is the use of such a head? If this head is just going to give us trouble, it is better to break the nut here. And get all this nonsense out.

It is very simple. It will work out. And don’t believe these people when they say that, “You are “paapi” (sinner), you are horrible, you have done this thing, that thing. Bring me a cow and I will save your mother in the heavens. We are all intelligent people, actually. Actually, Bengalis are brilliant people. One Bengali goes abroad and everybody says, “He is so intelligent”. But in his own country, he is dominated by this. The idea that these are gurus and who are these, people we must respect, who can prove that you are a paapi.

Never respect a man who says such a horrible thing to you. Never. Believe Me. I am your Mother and to Me, you are very clear. And I don’t think anybody is a sinner here. Please believe when I say this. The way I love you, you have to love yourself and I have respect for you. Complete respect. You will know your own truth. You will know what you are. 
It is very simple to know yourself when this connection is established. Like this instrument is connected to the mains, in the same way, when you are connected to the mains, you will know how glorious you are. Then you will [UNCLEAR]. Before that, do not have any [UNCLEAR]. It is very important, before we start the process of Self-realisation, that we do not have any diffidence about ourselves. Of any kind. Also one has to be humble about it that you have to have your Self-realisation.

Like somebody coming to Me with a revolver, “Mother, give me my realisation”. The kundalini will not budge. How can I give you realisation? It may just sit down there. May never come up. How can we know?

She understands everything. What to do? As certain nourishment is needed for sprouting the seed, also for raising the kundalini, we have to do that in our own humble way. Christ has said that, “You will have to become like small children if you want to enter in the Kingdom of God”. These tremendous things happen inside also. Your Mooladhara chakra just stops working its function. Completely. [UNCLEAR]. That means you become absolutely innocent at that time where you stand.

You get back your innocence. Whatever you have lost, you get it back. And that innocence is so pure. And such a person, even if he pays attention to someone - that can help that other person. Even a glance, it helps. Because this love I am talking about is a very great, powerful love. Which doesn’t want anything. It loves because it loves.

We have never known the power of love. We know the power of hatred only. With some excuse, we find out how to hate others. I mean, of course, in India people don’t say like that. But in the West, they say, “I hate you”. In India, if someone says, “Mein tuzhse grhruna karta hu” (I hate you), people will say, “He is mad; put him in the lunatic asylum”. We don’t say such things, “ghruna karta hu”, can anyone say this? This is our culture; we never say that.

So this powerful Love that is all around you nourishes your chakras, nourishes you and is all the time flowing through you. So the potential that you have, you have to find it. And the potential, when it will flower - you will be amazed at yourself; what you are. You are so pure within, with joy. Absolutely “nirmal”. Khalid. Khalid. I am making the Khalid Saab. By making Khalid people. What are those people doing by making Khalid? How can you people Khalid by breathing? I can’t understand. If you have to wear the sari, clean it, then wash it - not to destroy it.

This is what we have to do and all over the world, this movement has started in a very big way. I am sure all of you will take it up seriously. And go deep down within and make all your powers express themselves. Then you will know what powers you have. You don’t have to do anything. Only we have meditation about five minutes in the morning, usually and about ten minutes in the evening.

Now how do you get realisation? You don’t have to go to the Himalayas, stand on your head for ten years and ten years on one foot. That’s not going to happen. Nothing of the kind. What you have to do is very simple. Is that you have to come to the collective. This is the way it works. It is not individual. For the individual, you have to do much, suffer - nothing. Fasting is not allowed here. If you want to fast for yourself, it is all right - but not for God. He doesn’t want you to fast any further. Why should He trouble? He is God Almighty, He is your Father.

If you want to show temper to your Mother, you just don’t eat your food, very simple. And then the mother falls at your feet, “Baba, you..”. Now you know this, all of you. Is the best way to punish your mother is not to eat. So there is no fasting, no suffering, nothing to be done - except you have to come to the collective.

Now as you know, we don’t take money. So we don’t have elaborate palaces for you to come into for meditation. But we have simple places where you have to come as ordinary people. You may be a great raja or anything. But, as it is now, whether you are a raja or prime minister, you all have to sit together and pray together, do Namaz together. In the same way, we do not want to, in any way, to feel that you are in any way higher, or you are holding a very big position, so you must get a special chair - that’s not possible. We are all just the same in front of God.

So you all have to come to the samuhikta, to the collective - and the cleansing takes place automatically. In Sahaja Yoga, there is a compulsion that we have to come to the samuhik.

There’s another problem. That Sahaja Yoga door is open to all of you. All kinds of people can come. Every type of person can come in. It cannot, of course, do anything [UNCLEAR]. It cannot. But it is for you to achieve your own goal. If you are looking at others, “this man came, this man did this, he has come, who has come”, you don’t have to bother. You just come for yourself. Now, you don’t have to look at others, you come for yourself, that’s all. And that’s only possible because, after raising the kundalini which rises - and when the kundalini rises, your attention is sucked in, and you go inside and see for yourself.

Now don’t have doubts about yourself. I see people have doubts, “I may get married; will I get it or not?”. You will all get it, I promise you. Now don’t have doubts at all. That’s very important that you should have complete self-confidence. It’s your birthright and you will get your Self-realisation.

[Break in recording. When it resumes, Shri Mataji has notes of questions in Her hand and is replying].

Shri Mataji: Vibrations are called by Adi Shankaracharya as “Soundarya Lahiri” (waves of beauty). And the paramchaitanya is called as “rooh”. The all-pervading power of God’s love. And also as “rutumbhara pragyna” by Patanjali. But vibrations doesn’t mean that you start shaking. No, no, no, no, it doesn’t mean that. These vibrations, if you are shaking means [UNCLEAR]. It’s a very cool, soothing, breeze-like feeling on your hands.

Adi Shankaracharya has described that. “Salilam, salilam”. That means cool and cool. In the Bible, it is called the “cool breeze of the Holy Ghost”. All is there. Only we have to read between the lines. But not just now. “Bas ek hi akshar prem ka, padhe to pandit hoye” (Just one of love, read it and become a scholar). Let’s have this within us. And then we will talk about [UNCLEAR].

[UNCLEAR/Shri Mataji reads a line from the paper in hand]. I would request you just now; that you should concentrate only on one point - that “I should get my Self-realisation”.

[Reading another note]: There is somebody, some gentleman who has said that he has felt the cool breeze in his hand and that he likes it very much.

The gentleman who wants to write about his realisation; you are welcome. But go deep into it first. Deep into it. You are welcome to write about it. I will be very happy if you do.

[Reading another note]: There is another gentleman who has not felt the cool breeze [UNCLEAR]. And he writes, “Mother, please forgive me”. There is nothing to forgive. You have done little wrong. There must be an obstruction. It’s all right. You will get it today.

[Reading another note]: There’s another .... should I speak in Hindi?

Seekers: Yes.

Shri Mataji: These people are saying speak in English, speak in Marathi, should I speak in Bengali?

[Seekers saying, English, Hindi etc. in chorus].

Shri Mataji: The questions are coming in English. By the way, it cannot be explained properly in English. As I was saying yesterday, the English language is such that the word “spirit” means Atma also, alcohol also and bhut also. It feels very strange to say that word. French is worse than that.

There is no word for “chetana” (awareness) in French. There are thousands of words written about alcohol. For all sorts of useless things from around the world, described in thousands of words. But for chetana, awareness, they do not have a word. Talk about the French language. And they think no end of themselves. After drinking alcohol they go sit on some different horse.

[Reading another note]: One gentleman says he wants to meet Me individually. That’s a very nice thing. But, Me, what can I tell you about My state? Here today and there tomorrow. I do not understand. Tomorrow morning, I am going to Australia. So you come to Australia to meet Me. I will try.

[Reading another note]: This gentleman writes in Hindi. [UNCLEAR]. Those children who are [UNCLEAR] they should become all right.

The reason is all right but the solution should be there. For these children, the solution is Sahaja Yoga. Through Sahaja Yoga, many such children have become all right. So if you really want these children to gain something, then you should understand all the techniques of Sahaja Yoga properly. And then you will know it is very easy.

Any other questions?

[Reading another note]: Method of...? They will tell you where you have to go for meditation. You note it down. And anyway, they have printed it somewhere.

[Reading another note]: This point is right. “You are asking the hungry (starving) to sing bhajans”. I am not saying to do bhajans at all. I am saying that you get Self-realisation. Even if you are hungry, you will get it. Your work will be done. And then you will no longer be hungry. You will become completely contended.

Such power will come within you that you will be content. And the one who is doing all the organising, Paramatma - you do not know the government of Paramatma. You have become used to the government here. Here you have to go hungry.

My grandmother used to say this about God. There was a man who was going to meet God. I mean, grandmother’s stories were like this. So he met another man. Who was standing on his head? So he said, “You are going to meet God. Please tell God, ‘I am standing on my head every day, working hard. I am doing surya namaskars every day. I do this, I do that. When will You meet me?’ Please ask Him”.  Another man was lying by the side of the road. “You are going to meet God? Tell Him that I am hungry since yesterday; arrange food for me”.

So he said, “All right. I will tell God both these things”. He went to God. God met him. And he said, “There is one poor gentleman below, who keeps standing on his head, works very hard, does hatha yoga. At least please talk about meeting him. When will you meet him?”. So He said, God, said, “All right, tell him to work for some more days. We will see”. This man was perplexed that the man wanted to meet God so much and God did not want to meet him.

Then he told Him, “There was one more gentleman who said he was hungry for the past two days and God has not arranged any food or drink for me”. Immediately He called His manager and said, “Please arrange something for him. You have not given him anything to eat or drink”.

Everyone was amazed. Even the man was amazed that God is taking so much trouble for such a man. And the other man who has been standing on his head for so many days, there is nothing for him.

So God understood his question. He said, “You do this - when you do down and meet them both, tell them one thing - ‘When I went to meet God, I saw God pass a camel through the eye of a needle. Then you see what the matter is”.

So when he went down and he met the first man, he asked, “Brother, what did God say?”. “God said to wait for a few days”. “Is it? But he will someday, no?”. “Yes, you just have to wait”. “All right, what did you see there?”. “I saw that in the eye of a needle, God passed a camel”. “Ah, just because you have come from God, you are making things up. What can such a thing be possible? Pass even an eagle through the eye of a needle?”.

The other man was also there. He asked, “Did you get your food arranged?”. He said, “Yes, it was done. I was here, it was all done. I didn't even come to know. All right, what did you see?”. “That God passed a camel through the eye of a needle. Something very surprising”. He said, “What is so surprising about it? Arre, He is God. The world, the whole world He can pass through it. He is God, what do you think He is? He is all-pervading, all-encompassing God”. Because he was a realised soul, he was a param bhakta of God.

So the man who is talking about hunger today - to him I can say with full confidence that all this will be over. You get your Atma first, and then we will talk. You come into His kingdom first. If anyone tells Me that, “I am doing Sahaja Yoga and I am sick”, I say, “No, no, not possible. You are not doing it. There is something wrong. There is wavering in your faith. You do not have faith in yourself. You have faith in the doctor. Or you are doing something wrong. This is not possible”.  This is the truth.

Some doctors sometimes get upset about this. That, “Mother, you say that all diseases will be cured”. Baba, there are a lot of rich people sitting around for the doctors. I am talking about the ordinary man. They are never going to come here. Politicians are never going to come here. Bureaucrats are never going to come here. The ordinary people are going to come here, who is there for them? And the rest of these people can keep giving money to doctors.

So you can be in peace. Now, are the questions done? There have been too many questions. You want to say something?

Someone: [UNCLEAR].

Shri Mataji: Yes, let us have realisation first. See, they have come here again. Then we will see what is next. I had told you that by giving answers to questions, it is a waste of time. Because that is not going to give realisation.

Yes. “Tatshan” (in a split second), it can happen. Tatshan.

Everybody is ready now? Very good. Excellent.

Seeker: Mother, one more.

Shri Mataji: Yes, later.

Seeker: Last one.

Shri Mataji: You please sit down. I am here after this. After all of you have left, then I will leave. Then you can ask Me any question. I have a lot of love. That is why there will be no problem with time nor anything else.

So now you should quietly obtain Self-realisation.

First of all, it has to be mentioned about this, that there are three conditions. I may have mentioned it yesterday also. That you should have complete self-confidence that, “I can attain this state”. [UNCLEAR/Anyone]. Everyone should have this self-confidence. This is the first thing.

And the second condition is that “I am a sinner, I am very unhappy” - these kinds of negative feelings about oneself - get rid of them. These thoughts are of no benefit. It harms. People who have this, their (Left) Vishuddhi chakra gets caught up. And when the Vishuddhi chakra catches then you get diseases. You can get angina. Not only that, even spondylitis can occur. And all the organs that are in your body - they all become lethargic. So please, somehow or other, you accept that you are not guilty in any way whatsoever. This is the second condition.

The third condition is that you have to forgive everyone together. At the same time. It means that “I want to forgive this person, I do not want to forgive that one”, without thinking about it, just forgive everyone. The thing is that whether you forgive someone or not, you do not do anything. It is just in the head. But when you do not forgive someone, then you play into the wrong hands. They are nicely enjoying and troubling others and you are troubling your own self. So at the same time, “I have forgiven everyone” - say this in your mind once. These are the three conditions.

Those who are sitting on chairs and those sitting on the ground, please remove your shoes. And both legs - those who are sitting on the ground, it is great - those who are sitting on chairs should keep both legs apart. Because left and right are both sympathetic nervous systems that are completely different from each other. On the left side, we have the desire power and on the right side, we have the action power.

And do not think you are guilty. If you think of yourself as guilty, then the kundalini will stop at the throat and will not rise. So you do put yourself on judgement. Have you understood? Please, you are not guilty. On anything. You are humans, after all, only God [UNCLEAR] - you are not God. But you are not guilty.

[Shri Mataji rubs Her Left Vishuddhi finger and holds Her left palm outstretched].

Now your left hand is the sign of desire and it means that you have the desire for Self-realisation. Very comfortably [UNCLEAR]. All those who are sitting down and on chairs. Even sitting on chairs, you will still get Self-realisation.

Now that Ganga (river) is here, then where will you go - whether you sit down, or on chairs or My head. So one should keep a joyful attention towards oneself. Do not be upset with yourself. Forgive yourself and be joyful. I have been trying to make you understand for some time now.

Now keep your left hand like this (outstretched). Comfortably. Towards Me.

And with your right hand, you have to activate the chakras on your left-hand side. That I show you.

First of all, on the heart. You have to close your eyes and do this afterwards; first I will show you.

In the heart is the reflection of the Spirit. The Spirit is there. The reflection of Paramatma, in the form of Atma, is the light within us.

After that, it must be understood that when the light of the Spirit is enlightened within us, we are guided by that light.  So we become our own guru, our own guide, our own master.

Now this same hand, you should bring on the upper part of the stomach on the left side. We will do all the work on the left side.

This is the chakra of the guru tattwa which all the great sadgurus have made within us and which we have to awaken.

Then we have to bring the right hand below the abdomen on the left side. This is the chakra of pure knowledge. Means, all the work of the paramchaitanya, how it is done - you come to know and it starts flowing through your fingers. This is pure knowledge. You are aware of the black knowledge. This is pure knowledge. You will attain it.

Then you will place your hand on the upper side of the abdomen. Then, on the heart.

And then between the neck and shoulder, with the head turned to the right. Now this chakra, as I told you if you feel guilty - it is caught.

Now some people are using their left hand. Do it with the right hand. The right hand.

No, no, no, from the front (position of the left hand for Vishuddhi chakra). Keep it in front.

Now you have to place your right hand on the forehand. Press it on both sides. And bend the head down. And here you have to forgive everyone at the same time.

This same chakra has its second half on the back of the head.

[Shri Mataji places right hand on the back of the head].

Now bend your neck backwards and up. Here, without blaming yourself or others, for your own sake, ask for forgiveness from paramchaitanya.

Now the last chakra, Sahasrara. Now stretch out the palm of your right hand completely. And place it on the “talu” (fontanelle bone area), the soft area that you had in your childhood. Here the fingers should be stretched and pointing up. With that - this is very important, stretch them - this will put nice pressure on the talu.

Now you have to move the hand slowly in a clockwise manner on the talu. Seven times. Press it. It should be pressed. With the fingers outstretched. That is all you have to do. Nothing else.

Now one request to all, with folded hands. Those people who do not wish to follow the technique of Sahaja Yoga, it will be a great favour if they can leave the hall. Because it is a decent thing to do. Sitting here and gawking at other people will not be effective. So those who do not want to do this, they may please leave and do us a big favour. The practice of just looking at others may harm them. So those who do not want to do anything, they may please leave. It will be a big favour.

Now keep the left hand (towards Shri Mataji) and, closing your eyes, place the right hand on your heart. Those sitting on chairs, with their two legs apart.

Do not say any mantra. If you are wearing an amulet of any kind, please remove it. Or you are wearing something that is putting pressure on your waist or neck, please loosen it. But remove any amulet or (religious) thread (around the hand).

Now, placing your hand on the heart, you will ask Me a very fundamental question. “Shri Mataji, am I the Spirit?”. This is a very fundamental question. You can ask this three times. You can call me Mother or Shri Mataji. And ask Me three times in your mind, “Mother, am I the Spirit?”.

Now you have to take your hand to the upper side of your stomach on the left side and press it like this. Here the second fundamental question has to be asked three times. “Shri Mataji, am I my own guru?”.

Here you have to ask in your mind, three times, the question - “Shri Mataji, am I my own guru? Mother, am I my own guru?”.

I had told you at the outset that I respect your freedom. And I cannot impose force on you in any way. That is why you have to ask for pure knowledge. Please place your right hand on the lower part of the stomach on the left-hand side.

And here you repeat six times because this chakra has six petals. Six times, because it has six petals. Six times, “Shri Mataji, please give me pure knowledge”.

“Shri Mataji, please give me pure knowledge”. Has to be said six times.

As soon as you say this six times, your kundalini starts the upward movement. She starts ascending. That is why we have to awaken or nourish the upper chakras again.

With self-confidence, you have to place your right hand on the upper side of the stomach. Here you have to say with full confidence, “Shri Mataji, I am my own guru”. “Mother, I am my own guru”. This you will say, with complete self-confidence ten times.

Now know that you are not this body, mind, intellect, ego or conditioning - none of these labels. You are the complete Spirit. You are the pure Atma. You have to pay honour to this pure Spirit. That is why, please place your right hand on the heart and say with full self-confidence, “Shri Mataji, I am pure Spirit”. Say this twelve times. Twelve times. “Mother, I am pure Atma”. Say it twelve times.

This paramchaitanya is the ocean of knowledge. It is the ocean of love, solace and joy. But above all, it is the ocean of forgiveness. You can do no wrong that it cannot be dissolved completely in this ocean. That is why you forgive yourself completely.

And place your right hand on the corner of the left shoulder and neck - the further back the better - and turn your head towards the right. This chakra gets caught when you consider yourself guilty. That is why, say here sixteen times with full self-confidence, “Shri Mataji, I am not guilty at all”. “Mother, I am not guilty at all”. In this manner, you please say it sixteen times.

I had told you earlier that whether you forgive or not, you do nothing. But if you do not forgive, you play into the wrong hands. So those who have troubled you - do not think about them. It is not necessary to bring their name to mind. Just you have to forgive them altogether.

And so, bring your right hand on your forehand and press it hard. And bending it forward, you have to say with all your heart - with your heart, does not matter how many times - that, “Shri Mataji, I have forgiven everyone”. “Mother I have forgiven everyone together”. And say with all your heart, because this chakra is very sensitive. And if you do not forgive everyone with your heart, the kundalini will remain here. Forgive everyone with all your heart, at the same time.

Now take the hand to the back of the head and raise the head upwards. Here, for your own satisfaction, without counting your faults, or blaming yourself, does not matter how many times - to say with all your heart that - “Oh paramchaitanya, if I have made any mistakes, please forgive me”. “Oh paramchaitanya, if I have made any mistakes, please forgive me”.

Now, for the last chakra, stretch out your palm. And place the centre of the palm on your talu. Bend down your neck. And place the palm on the centre and fingers pointing out and upward. And bending down your neck - this is very important. Bend down the neck.

And at this time, I respect your freedom. Please keep the neck bent. And I cannot give you Self-realisation forcibly. That is why you have to say when you rotate the talu with the pressure of your hand seven times - when you rotate clockwise seven times you have to say that, “Shri Mataji, please give me Self-realisation”. “Mother, please give me Self-realisation”. Seven times you have to say because the peethas (seats) of the seven chakras are in our head.

[Shri Mataji blows into the microphone]. Keep the head down.

Now take your hand down and slowly open your eyes. And you can also wear your glasses. Now raise both hands (upwards and outstretched). 
Now keep the right hand towards Me and with the left hand over the head, check if there is a cool or hot breeze coming from the talu.  Those who have liver or similar complaints will get a hot breeze. Or those who have not forgiven may also get a hot breeze. So now you forgive. 

Please see if you are feeling a cool breeze or hot breeze. You have to know. You have to see for yourself. I am not going to say anything. You have to see if there is a cool breeze coming from within.

Now left hand towards Me. Again lower the head and with the right hand see if there is a cool breeze coming or not. Some get it close (to the head), others get it further away but do not keep the hand on the head. See here.

Some get it very far, like a jet and some get it closer and mild. Please see. Pay attention here (over the talu). See here, you will feel it.

Now one more time, put the right hand towards Me and bending the head, see if the cool breeze is coming or not (with the left hand).

Now raise both your hands to the sky, bend your head back and ask one question. “Shri Mataji, is this paramchaitanya?”. Ask this three times. That, “Shri Mataji, is this brahmachaitanya”. Or, “Shri Mataji, is this the prem shakti of Paramatma?”.

And place your hands towards Me like this (outstretched) and look at Me. And do not think. This is “nirvichar samadhi” (thoughtless awareness). The people who have, in their hands, or fingers, or talu, felt the cool or hot breeze - these people may please raise both hands.

See now, all of you are realised. To all you saintly people, My namaskar.

[English translation from Hindi 37min].

Shri Mataji (in Hindi): As described yesterday, that what is Truth is also dharma. It remains still (absolute) in its place.  We are not able to imagine it. We are not able to give any simile to it. Nor can we change it. And the thing is, in this human awareness, we are not able to know that Truth.

It should be accepted that science has now reached its limit. And it has definitely given a lot of benefits. But along with that, atom bomb, hydrogen bomb and plastics have been created. In the machine age, whatever was created has gone and crossed its boundaries. That now in [UNCLEAR/Ranchi?] and in Calcutta city, there is a high level of pollution. The reason for all this happening is that man has lost his balance. He does not know to what point he should go and where he should stop.

Due to this, Whatever man does, later on, it [UNCLEAR]. In the human awareness [UNCLEAR/whatever is missing], this evolution, we get that in Sahaja Yoga. We have not done anything special to become human. We have obtained it easily. [UNCLEAR/We have easily reached the human stage]. And now you are human.

And in this human state, Paramatma has given you full freedom, that if you wish you can go towards heaven or if you wish, you can go towards hell. Now, in these modern times, even if one takes the name of Paramatma, people think you are mad. But as I said yesterday, if we take offence and without seeking, we say God does not exist, then it is a belief that we have made and are holding fast onto it; in which there is no basis.

I say there is God. Not just in humans, but in all four directions, His power is pervading. It is pervading in all four directions in the form of paramchaitanya. Today, when we see these flowers when we see the marvels of nature – but we do not think as to how Mother Earth produces all these different types of trees and fruits and how she sustains them. And going further, if we look at ourselves – our eyes, our nose and the structure of our whole body – how miraculous it is. [UNCLEAR].

If we think deeply, we will know that humans could not have evolved in such a short time. In such a short time [UNCLEAR]. Science has no answer for many such things. And in all sincerity, they have to admit - whatever they see from outside and attain it, that only [UNCLEAR]. But that there is something within us, a mechanism by which we can obtain this [UNCLEAR/revolution], they do not know.

[UNCLEAR sentence/scientific research does not tell us]. If we ask them, that a seed which is sown in the earth, please tell how does it sprout into a sapling by itself – they do not know. It sprouts by itself, it sprouts only the plant species to which it belongs and it grows and stays only within its limits. And in that same seeds, there is the map of all the seeds that will sprout. Such an immense work is going on at a subtle level. But we do not wish to even look at the work because we are not able to explain it.

This work taking place through the all-pervading power of God's love. This is the power of love. This is the one performing all the living processes and it is the one that resides in our heart. You may think whatever I am saying is a mental image. But it should be considered as a hypothesis. And if this hypothesis can be proved then you have to admit with all honesty that there is such a thing within us.

First of all, we think all the time that we are completely useless. That we are human is all right but it is of no avail. We are not fit for anything. We cannot do anything. We start thinking like this beforehand, that after all, we are [UNCLEAR]. On the other side, there are people who say that there is no such thing as fate; God does not exist; whatever we say is the law.

There are many people who are seeking [UNCLEAR] and there are also people who are seeking in the wrong places and feeling content that, "We have acquired wealth". But they’re also people who are "sadhakas" (seekers); who are dissatisfied and who feel that there has to be some path beyond all this. Whatever problems are there in the attention of the world today - be it poverty or pollution - man is the reason behind them.  Man has created all the problems.

So if mankind is behind these problems and if mankind is transformed - if there is a transformation, a transformation within man - then think how big an accomplishment this would be. That is why it is said in all the religious scriptures that you attain "Atmasakshatkar" (Self-realisation). But in modern times, people do not read the scriptures. Some people tell them some nonsensical things - and they ponder about those.

As Nanak has said, [UNCLEAR/"Kahe khojan jaaye. Kehna hi to aap mi dikhe sab"]. Until the time that you do not recognise yourself, your delusion will not go. Krishna also said. Everybody has said this. Jesus Christ has said, "You are to be born again". So they just put the label, "We are born again". And think, "We are born again". By giving yourself a label you are not born again.

The man who has known the Brahma, who has attained Brahma - he alone is Buddha. Just calling yourself Buddha in vain does not mean you have become Buddha. You cannot attain it in any form of a concept or mental thinking. This has to happen inside you. And that happening is very easy, very sahaja and very straightforward. This is because it is absolutely vital. Just as breathing is extremely vital, in the same way, this is absolutely vital for the last step in our evolution.

And it is going to happen in the dire state of this Kalyuga. And all of you seekers who are sitting here, those of you who want to attain it [UNCLEAR]. Now you have been told about the benefits of this on the outer side. That physically, mentally and emotionally you have complete relief. Not only that but after this you also get powers and by these powers, you can give this power (of realisation) to other people. You can also cure their diseases. You can also give them mental peace. All kinds of bad habits automatically drop off.

The condition of the household improves, that of your children improves and even farming gives a ten times more yield. And even the domestic animals become healthy and yield ten times more milk. And this is all shown through experiment. But there is something even more that I am going to talk to you about today.

That is you see your Self within. You get the experience of your own Spirit. When your Spirit comes into your attention, then you can know on your fingertips which chakras are damaged and the chakras of others that are damaged. This is called “samuhik chetna” (collective consciousness). You know in “yashti” (individually) and you also know in “samashthi” (collectively). If you know what is the cause of problems in others and if you make use of this power in your hands for the benevolence of others, then that is it – you can do good to others and also to yourself.

When doing good to others, there is no [UNCLEAR] and you do not face any problems. Because when you get this power in the Sahaja manner and it starts flowing through you, then you do not say that I am the doer. “This is happening, it is flowing, it is taking place”. And when paramchaitanya itself looks after you then you are amazed that “How did I receive this help? How did this take place? How did I get this?”. You are left in amazement and if you ask about this to any Sahaja Yogi, they will all have long instances of their own experiences.

The other thing that happens is that, in the light of the Spirit, you come to know the Absolute Truth. You know now that you are standing in front of Mother because you are seeing this and listening with your own ears. But your concepts may not be the same as someone else’s. What you believe in, the other person does not. You are busy in one type of system while the other is busy in his own system.

In religion, one says, “This religion is good”, another says, “My religion is good”, a third one says, “My religion is good”. They all think theirs is good, although it is hard to see anyone who is actually religious. The reason for this is that what we believe in, we have not really scrutinised it and neither do we have a method to do this scrutiny.

That whether this is the truth or not. For this, the “chaitanya lahiri” (waves of bliss) should flow from our hands. Then you can immediately ask if this is the truth or no. If you wish to ask, “Is it true that God exists or no?” – then you can ask this question with your hands (palms outward) like this. You will see that cool breeze starts flowing from your hands and then you will experience this chaitanya for the very first time. The first time.

For the first time, you will be connected with and nourished by this extraordinary power. So, you have to do one thing before. That you obtain Self-realisation. Because you come to know the truth in the light of the Spirit. Whatever anyone says about Me, pay no attention to it because, unless and until you get the sight to see, how will you recognise Me? So it is essential to get this vision. Then you will be able to recognise truth and untruth.

When the drop becomes the ocean, its meanness, smallness, poverty and the [UNCLEAR/filth] inside all get destroyed. In the same way, you have to attain that beauty. And this complete arrangement has been made by God. I do not do anything. The truth is that you are your own power. Kundalini is your own mother, who [UNCLEAR]. She is sitting comfortably in the triangular position, just waiting for the day when she can [UNCLEAR/lift/bring up] her child. She is so [UNCLEAR/anxious] and she is very desirous of somehow she should complete this work.

But today our state is different. The time has come that today we can in our [UNCLEAR/existing] condition, attain Self-realisation. About the Atma, many things have been said, that you get “Atmanand” (Joy of the Spirit), Brahmanand (Universal Joy) and Niranand (Eternal Joy) which means you go into complete bliss. That joy and [UNCLEAR], does not mean that you turn away from reality; rather you understand reality.

Till the time that you are not sitting in the boat, you are not able to see your problems. Then how will you solve them? When you have become separate from your problems then you can see what the solution should be and you also come up with the answer.

In these modern times [UNCLEAR], this is a very great age. In the Nala Damayanti adhyaya, Nala was separated from Damayanti and was very unhappy. One day he came across Kali and he caught hold of him. “I am going to kill you. You are the reason that people go into delusions. You are the reason they get lost. You are the reason that they become mean. So I have to kill you”. So Kali said, “All right. But first, you must hear out my importance. [UNCLEAR], what is my importance. After that, you may kill me.

My importance is that when my “yuga” (age) arrives, the people who are living in the jungles and seeking the truth, they will take birth as ordinary householders. And in that Kaliyuga only, they will attain the Truth. Now if you wish to kill me, then do so”.

So Nala asked, “But why will this happen in Kaliyuga?”. “Because in Kaliyuga, man will be [UNCLEAR]. He will turn his attention and ask that there must be a way to go beyond all these things. He will be tired of going to the temples, going to the masjids, going to [UNCLEAR/forest?] and [UNCLEAR/worldly life?] and will ask, ‘What is this drama, after all?’. Then he will become the ocean. And when he becomes the ocean, he will attain this”.

This is the fact that was stated in [UNCLEAR] prediction. But this prediction was also accepted by Kali as the truth. Because one thing you do not know is that this paramchaitanya, is “tatastha” (detached). Completely detached. Today I see, that in these fifty years, Kritayuga has started. And this Kritayuga has also made the paramchaitanya very active. It has become dynamic. And this paramchaitanya is performing this work. Every moment, in every direction.

You will experience this after Self-realisation, that all the time, someone is helping you, someone is looking after you. All the time someone is with you, when you need something it is in front of you if you need someone, they are in front of you. Not only that but all the time you are in bliss. So to obtain this Supreme joy you first have to have Self-realisation. If someone says that you just get into joy, then this is incorrect.

One has to be [UNCLEAR/manifest?] it for oneself. One has to be honest with oneself. And if all this is for our own benevolence, then why not attain it? And if this is your own Kundalini and she is your mother and she knows all about you; and she is in anticipation that somehow or other to give you Self-realisation – then why not [UNCLEAR/manifest it?]. And why not accept it?

What is the need to doubt or question it? Nobody is taking any money from you. Nobody is asking you to hand over your property. Nobody can take anything for this. Because this is such a priceless thing that those people who ask for money in the name of God –  be extremely wary about them. Does God understand banks or money? Never – this is something that we have created. What connection can God have with it?

We are now people who have been brought up in such a culture where without giving money, no work can be done. This is only that man has dared to do, that is why we have to spend so much money. These things of man which are so despairing are also equally with hope. If there is a transformation in man, in all of society. If all of India transforms and not only that but the whole world transforms – even if not everybody, enough people are transformed then the world will change.

Because you become completely immaculate. You become completely sahaja [UNCLEAR]. [UNCLEAR/You get sight] of where you want to go, and you also reach your destination quite easily. This might appear strange to listen to and even miraculous to think about. The thing is, these things are there and today, you are going to attain Self-realisation. Everyone, all those who are sitting here, they all should be able to get Self-realisation.

However, there is just one thing – you should have a pure desire. If you do not have a pure desire, then this cannot be forced upon you. Because of the freedom that God has given you, that has to be respected. You should desire this in independence. Because Kundalini is pure desire. Because other desires are transient – today there is one desire, then we turn away. Tomorrow you want this and then something [UNCLEAR sentences]. This means that our desires are not pure desire.

There is only one pure desire. Anyway, whether we know it or not, through this paramchaitanya, [UNCLEAR/will give this to us]. Knowingly or unknowingly, this power takes us everywhere and we seek there. Some seek in money, some seek in power, some seek in family and household and in the end he comes to know that these do not have that joy. Then he turns and thinks where Supreme joy can be found and that it is within us, inside us.

This is not just talk but there is something in it. This should take place in reality, there should be an actualization, this happening should take place – otherwise, it is all just talk. People in our country simply talk on this, more than necessary and everyone is fed up, of listening to them and [UNCLEAR].

But the time has come now for [UNCLEAR/the experience?] and if there are any questions that may have come up for you and [UNCLEAR] if such questions are there, I would definitely like to answer them. Although you may know that I visit a lot of countries and face all types of questions, I have become very proficient. [UNCLEAR] and even if I give realisation, it does not mean that your Kundalini can be awakened. It would be [UNCLEAR/ridiculous]. I am talking about going beyond your intelligence. It is about going beyond the mind-intellect-ego. And for it, any type of [UNCLEAR/abstaining], holding fasts or merely talking about it – it is not going to happen.

By the way, My [UNCLEAR]. But without meeting these people are not able to understand how just with the hands [UNCLEAR]. But this is a matter of love. In love, it is not necessary that you are always [UNCLEAR/together]. But [UNCLEAR statement]. I think you all should get it today. But after getting (Self-realisation) it should not be that the seed sprouted and then was not [UNCLEAR/allowed to grow/looked after]. That should not happen. After the seed is sprouted after that you have to turn it into a tree.

A tree of this kind can benefit thousands of people. All types of prosperity can be achieved. All kinds of support can be provided. I would like to tell you that even though there is so much unemployment in London – all those who have come to Sahaja Yoga, whatever type they may have been – not one Sahaja Yogi is jobless. All have got jobs, they have [UNCLEAR/progressed]. Because the principle of Laxmi is also here. But to [UNCLEAR/capture the heart of Laxmi], that should also be understood.

Because Laxmiji is also standing in a state of balance. Mother Laxmi is a goddess full of love. In Her two hands; there is a lotus in each – a pink lotus flower. There is no shade pink like the pink colour of the lotus. She has two in Her hands and She is also standing in a lotus. Means there is a lot of simplicity in Her and She does not exert any kind of pressure. He should be recognised as Laxmipati who is as beautiful and attractive as a lotus – meaning his house and his heart should be beautiful. And there, even if a thorny black bee enters, [UNCLEAR] enters, it is received there. There should be love even towards him.

The second thing is, there is money flowing through one hand and the other hand is raised in blessing. This means there should be charity with one hand and with the other hand, refuge. Those who are under our refuge (dependents) should be treated with love and faith.

Three days ago, I explained to the members of Enlightened [UNCLEAR/name of organisation] and their wives how they should be in [UNCLEAR/rapport] with the locals and how they should establish a dialogue with them. How they should progress and monitor. And the Sahaja Yogis are active in this as to how they can establish this dialogue.

In this manner, the people (Sahaja Yogis?) of fifty-five countries – they mentioned today there are fifty-five countries – I have never seen them fight or quarrel with one another. They never complain about one another. We have people here who are so honest that people wonder how this honesty developed within them. And the Sahaja Yogis from abroad have become so moral that they do not even look at other women. Is this some kind of miracle? They have all become messengers of God and I hope that today, you also obtain that great principle.

I have nothing to give or take in this. There is no [UNCLEAR/favour] from Me. If a mother does something for her children, she does it with love because she loves. It is an act of love. How can there be any give or take in this? Any mother will desire that her children be bigger than her, be [UNCLEAR], be more loving than her and more compassionate than her. That they spend their life in felicity and joy. What else can a mother desire? Nothing else.

And in this country where the mother is [UNCLEAR/respected], where every woman is looked upon as a mother; in this country, you should understand – abroad where they do not understand the mother when they do not respect the mother; even they have honoured the mother – so for you, it is very easy. That in this “yogabhoomi” (land of yoga), where your culture is so high, your character is so high, where so many great sadhus, saints and seers of great character have lived – why should you not obtain it and settle in it?

In their care, they have not even heard the name of God, such as the Russians. And they have settled very deeply. It cannot be understood. There is a village there Togliatti – they have come in (to Sahaja Yoga) everywhere – but there is a village Togliatti where you will be amazed to hear there are twenty-two thousand Sahaja Yogis there, who are active there – twenty-two thousand. And they are very deep.

So think that in this country what progress there could be, where we have always talked about the truth. Where we have always talked about the Spirit. Where we have always been seeking God. In such a great country, this movement should be so great. I am very hopeful that one day, we will all be awakened and attain this truth.

My Endless Blessings to All of You!
