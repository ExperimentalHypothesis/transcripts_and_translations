Can you hear me there? At the back? It's alright?

But one must know that you cannot change the truth and you cannot transform it, unfortunately also at human awareness, you cannot know the truth. So, you have to get enlightenment. You have to get 'Bodha' as Buddha has got it. You have to have your self-realization, your selfhood. Without that, you cannot know the truth. Now, whatever I am going to tell you, you need not believe with your blind faith. But if it is proved, then you have to accept as honest people because this is for your benevolence and benevolence of the whole world.

You see we have ecological problems, economic problems, political problems, family problems, personal problems, but if you see it is only because of human beings. So, the human beings have to be transformed to overcome these problems. And inside you is placed this subtle body to transform you. Even there are religious problems and spiritual problems. You may follow any religion. You may be a Hindu, Muslim, Buddhist, Christian but anyone can commit any sin. Nothing to stop them. You have seen how people have been killing each other in the name of God. Also, those who have been following Buddhism have been quite violent. And the Christians, Muslims all of them just the same. Same with Hindus, nobody is an exception. So, we have missed the point and that is that we are not yet the Spirit.

All these incarnations tried that people should first have their self-realization. People like Buddha, Mahavira, Mohammad they talked of the abstract power. (Shri Mataji repeats here for the yogini translating) they talked about the abstract power. The Buddha, Mahavira did not even want to talk about God. They said first get your self-realization. But Buddha has said about the future Buddha. He called it as Matrayeya. And he said it is Boddhisatva. Boddhisatva is the power which will enlighten people and these enlightened people will enlighten others.

Same is said by a great seer William Blake in England. So, now the time has come for the people to get their enlightenment. We take everything for granted which is the living work. We see beautiful flowers we take them for granted. We don't even think what a miracle it is! Look at our eye! what a camera it is! Look at our brain! What a computer it is! But we take it for granted.

So, the truth is there is an all-pervading power of love, of pure love which does all this living work. How did we become human beings from amoeba? Nobody thinks! And our evolution is not yet complete. And our evolution is not yet complete (Shri Mataji repeats the line for the benefit of yogini translating her speech) because we have not reached the absolute point. If we would have reached the absolute point there would have been no quarrel, no war. In absoluteness, everybody sees the same point.

One has to realize that this is the living process of a living energy. And you cannot pay for this work. How much do we pay to mother earth for her work? She does not even understand money and banking. That Is the headache of human beings. So, now one has to understand that we have still to become the spirit as said by all scriptures. This is the fundamental truth about it and secondly, there is this all-pervading power of pure love and we have to get in contact with it. We have to feel it on our Central Nervous system. Whatever we have got in our evolution we feel on our Central Nervous system. It is not mental.

Many people think that by reading scriptures they can achieve spirituality but scriptures are just prescriptions, they are not the medicines. You have to take the medicine and not read the prescriptions all the time. I am happy you have already been told about the Subtle System. And now only my job is to see that you all get your self-realization.

As a result of that when this Kundalini passes through this center which we call as Agnya chakra, you become thoughtlessly aware means you are in the Present. You are either in the future or in the past. The thoughts come to us from the future or from the past and we are jumping on the curps of these thoughts. But if I ask you, you be in present you cannot be. Present is the reality. The past is finished and the future doesn't exist. Then only you are in Meditation. You do not have to meditate but you are in meditation.

But when this Kundalini passes through this center of Sahasrara of thousand petals then you can feel the cool breeze coming out of your own head. You can also feel the cool breeze around yourself. This cool breeze first time you feel is the all-pervading power of love, but then you have to establish this connection. You become absolutely peaceful and you see everything as a witness, as a witness. Everything looks like a drama. Supposing you are standing in the seawater you are afraid of the waves. But if you get into the boat then you can watch these. But supposing you know how to swim you can jump and save many others. As a result of the Kundalini awakening, you get your centers completely cleansed out. As a result, you get cured.

In Delhi, there are three doctors who have got their MD in Sahaja Yoga. The subjects were Epilepsy, Blood cancer, and Asthma. So many other diseases have been cured but is done by your own Kundalini. It is not something you do that you don't understand. You know everything about yourself, about your centers. About your centers and also you jump into another dimension of your awareness. You develop a new dimension called as Collective Consciousness, that means you can also feel on your fingertips centers of others. and if you know how to correct yourself or others you can help them. This is your own power. This is your own divinity which expresses, which manifests. Thus you become a transformed personality. On your fingertips, you can know the absolute Truth.

As you must be knowing Sahaja yoga is working now in sixty-two countries and surprisingly, we get people in India once a month, once a year from at least fifty two countries. I've never seen them quarreling, fighting in the collective. They have dropped their habits, bad habits of drugs, and everything. They are leading a very righteous life as if they have absorbed the good points of religion within themselves. They are just like Angels.

For Thailand, you will be happy to know, that we have got people from France from Switzerland to help the enlightenment of Thailand. The new race has been created of enlightenment and they have power to raise the Kundalini. They have power to cure others. They are always in Joy. The attention also is so enlightened, that wherever they put attention it acts. (Shri Mataji repeats for the yogini translating ) wherever they put attention it acts. Attention is not there in Thai language? Can you suggest a word for attention?

Now say, I say you pay attention to me, but if I say pay attention to yourself you cannot. Our attention is outside not inside and that happens, that we can know ourselves and we can know others in a very deeper way.

There are so many things one can say about Sahaja Yoga. In this one lecture not easy to cover all the subject. In this hall there are beautiful lights but to put the lights on you have to just put one switch and it's there because it is all built-in but if I have to tell you all about the electricity how it came here, how Bangkok was electrified, it will be so boring. But if it is built-in you can enlighten people first and in that light, they can see themselves.

So, I hope now we will have a session of realization for about 10 minutes but before that, I don't mind if you ask me some questions but it should not be some lecture. I have not come here to take anything from you, but I have come here to give you what is your own, what is your own property, what is your own beauty and glory. Also, I am a very great expert in answering. For 22 years I have been doing this work, but even if I answer you that's not a guarantee that your Kundalini will rise because questioning and answering is just a mental feed. But you have to be beyond the mind. May God bless you! Please tell me questions to be asked.

Sahaj yogini: (translating the question asked by a lady from the audience) This lady would like to know if Sahaja Yoga is basic realization.

Shri Mataji: it's a very ancient thing. Thousands of years. It was a tradition for one master to give realization to only one person. Sri Rama's father-in-law Raja Janaka gave realization to only one person called Nachiketa. Fourteen thousand years back Markandeya has written about it in Sanskrit language. But what I have done is that I have found out a method by which en mass realization can be given. You do not have to do any more penance or sufferings. You have already done it in your last lives, but you are just ready to get your realization. In Sanskrit, it is called Samadhi. Is to become yourself to get your selfhood. To become the absolute, to know the truth.

Actually, you become so dynamic because all the power starts flowing within you, all the vital powers. At the same time, you become very compassionate. Now, this instrument is made. It is useless if it is not connected to the mains. It has no meaning. In the same way unless and until human beings are connected to this all pervading power, it has no meaning. It's alright?

An audience: (unclear)

Shri Mataji: What is he saying?

Sahaj Yogini: This experience that you do here (unclear)

Shri Mataji: Of course! Self-confidence in the sense that you know yourself. It's not an ego. It's not in ignorance but in knowledge. An audience: (unclear)

Sahaj Yogini: What is that thing in the big green circle?

Shri Mataji: This we call as Void but this is not the one as described in Zen. This is the area where our valancies are there which are ten. Once these valencies are enlightened you become automatically 'dharmik' you become automatically religious which is innate. Religion is innate. The innate religion is awakened. I would say you will know all about it. We have a nice center here. We have very good people who will tell you all about it, for which you do not have to pay at all, but you have to come to the collective. Now, you do not have to go to the Himalayas, you will not have to do any ascetic practices. Only thing you have to come to the collective and you become cleansed automatically. Alright! Now, let us have realization! What is it?

An audience: Thank you my master! Is the same as enlightenment (unclear)

Shri Mataji: Of Course! Of course! Same! Same! Same! I mean I mean you sit down here just now I'll give you! (The audience start laughing) Be comfortable! Be comfortable! All of you, have to be comfortable! Let us have a realization.

The audience: thank you for (unclear)

Sahaja Yogini: He wants to thank you for your realization.

Shri Mataji: Thank you very much! It's very kind! It's very kind of you! First, you get your realization then you can thank me! Is he a journalist?

Sahaj yogini: Medicine! medicine!

Shri Mataji: You see we should think of the present. From that, you can achieve the highest. But as Buddha has said first get your self-realization. That is first thing is very important. Then you will know. The second state we call as doubtless awareness. When you have no doubts and you become a master.

Now, so, first of all, I have to tell you that I cannot force self-realization on you, I cannot force it because I respect your freedom. Now, those who do not want to have realization should leave the hall.

Now, there are three conditions which are very simple. The first one is that you all should have full confidence that you will get your realization.

The second one is very simple again, that you should not feel guilty about anything at this moment. Please do not think you have committed this sin and that sin. You are not to think about yourself in this manner. Do you know, if you feel guilty then this center catches here on the left-hand side. Now, and if this center catches on the left-hand side then you get problems physical also. You get a disease called Angina of the heart. You also may feel a, you can call a terrible spondylitis, spondylitis, spondylitis. What do you say to spondylitis here? a bone goes out like that. Spondylitis! Is there any doctor? Where the bones are shifted here especially. Also rheumatic lethargic organs. Lethargic organs. So, one has not to feel guilty at all. You are not Gods. In short, you have to be very pleasantly placed towards yourself. Forgive yourself and forget the past.

The third one is even simpler, that is to forgive everyone. Some people say it is very difficult to forgive, but logically if you forgive or don't forgive what do you do? You don't do anything, but if you don't forgive then you play into wrong hands. When you don't forgive then you play into wrong hands!

Also the centre here is like this absolutely constricted the Optic chasma. If you don't forgive it won't open. So, Kundalini cannot rise. So, as it is you are torturing yourself by not forgiving, and also you will not get your self-realization. So please forgive everyone and also don't think about them because it's a headache. Just forgive in general! You will feel much lighter.

So, now you don't have to do much! it's very simple! We'll tell you how first, you keep your eyes open, how you will nourish your own centres.

Before that, I would request you to take down your shoes. You can't see me? Please take down! Please come now! It's alright! You sit in front if you can't hear, if you can't see! Alright! Please take out your shoes! Those who are sitting on the chair have to put both their feet away from each other. Come in if you want! Come in front! Come along! Come along! it's alright! Come along! Come along! If you want to come, come along! There is a lot of space here! (Shri Mataji whispering to the Sahaja Yogini) Such beauty I tell you! beautiful! beautiful! It's good!

Now, in the left side is our power of desire and the right side is the power of action. Now, put your left hand towards me like this! Keep it on your lap! Just left hand towards me! Just simple! This symbolizes that you desire to have your self-realization. Just put your hand on your lap! Now, with the right hand, we will nourish our left-hand side centres.

So, first, we put our right hand on our heart. In the heart resides the Spirit. If you become the Spirit you become your own guide. You become your own master. So now take your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left and side! Alright now, this is the centre is for your mastery. This is created by great masters. This is created by great masters. Then you please take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side! They can't see it! Lower portion! Can you see it? Now, this is the centre for pure knowledge. Later on, you will know how the pure knowledge goes to the brain from here. Pure knowledge is that by which you know the divine laws. Also, you develop the power to use those divine powers.

So, now raise again your hand on the upper portion of your abdomen. Now, on your heart. Now, in the corner of your neck and your shoulder and turn your head to your right. I have already told you this center is that, when you feel guilty. So, now take your right hand on top of your forehead. Now bend your head as far as possible! Bend! Here you have to forgive everyone in general. Now, you have to take your right hand on the backside of your head and push back your head as far as possible. Here you have to, without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, just for your own satisfaction you have to ask forgiveness from the Divine power. Now, stretch your hand for the last center! Stretch your palm! Put the center of your palm on the top of your fontanelle bone area, which was a soft bone in your childhood! Now, please remember to push back your fingers so there is good pressure on your scalp. Put down your head as far as possible! Now, Move your scalp slowly seven times clockwise! Not your hand but your scalp seven times clockwise! Thats all one has to do! Very simple!

Now we have to close our eyes! You can take out your glasses! It might help your eyesight! When I tell you only then open your eyes. Alright! so now remember to keep your feet apart from each other, those were sitting on the chair and you have to be pleasantly placed towards yourself.

Now, please put left hand towards me! Close your eyes and put your right hand on your heart! Now, here you have to ask me a very fundamental question about yourself! You can call me M or you can call me Shri Mataji. Please ask a question 3 times! Mother, Am I the spirit? Mother Am I the Spirit? Ask three times! If you are the spirit you become your master.

So, please take your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side! Here you ask another fundamental question about yourself three times. Mother, am I my own Master? I've already told you that I respect your freedom. I cannot force pure knowledge on you. So, here is the center of pure knowledge. You have to say six times because this center has got six petals. Six times you have to say. Mother, please give me pure knowledge! As soon as you ask for pure knowledge, Kundalini starts rising.

So, you have to nourish your upper centres with your self-confidence. So, now raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side! Here, now you have to say with full confidence ten times, Mother, I am my own master! Please say ten times, Mother, I am my master!

You have to know that the truth is that you are not this body, you are not this mind, you are not this ego, you are not these conditionings, you are not these emotions, you are not these desires, but you are pure Spirit. So, now raise your right hand on your heart, and please say with full confidence twelve times, Mother, I am the pure Spirit!

You have to know that this all-pervading power of love is the ocean of knowledge. It is the ocean of compassion and bliss, but above all, it is the ocean of forgiveness. So, whatever mistakes you may commit, can be easily dissolved by this power of forgiveness.

So, please forgive yourself and put your right hand in the corner of your neck and you shoulder. Now, turn your head to your right! Now, please here you have to say with full confidence sixteen times, Mother I am not guilty at all!

I have already told you whether you forgive or don't forgive you don't do anything, but if you don't forgive you play into wrong hands. Also, this centre is very constricted so if you don't forgive Kundalini cannot rise. So, you will miss your self-realization.

Now, raise your right hand on top of your head, on your forehead across and bend your head as far as possible! Now, here with full confidence, you have to say, Mother, I forgive everyone! It is from your heart to be said not how many times. Now, without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes for your satisfaction you have to ask forgiveness from divine power.

So, now please take your right hand on the backside of your head and push back your head as far as possible! Here, you have to say again from your heart not how many times. Oh, Divine power! if I have done any mistakes knowingly or unknowingly please forgive me! Say it from your heart!

Now, the last centre is the most important where you have to stretch your palm fully and put your hand on the top of your fontanelle bone area which was a soft bone in your childhood. Stretch back your fingers and put down your head as far as possible! Here again, I cannot force self-realization on you. You have to ask for it. So, now please move your scalp seven times clockwise, seven times saying Mother, please give me my self-realization! Move it slowly slowly with pressure! (Shri Mataji blows into microphone seven times)

Now, please take down your hands! Slowly open your eyes! Please put both the hands towards me like this and now do not think! You can do it! Now, put the right hand towards Me and bend your head and see for yourself, if there is a cool breeze coming out of your fontanelle bone area. Don't put the hand on top of your head but away from it! Is could be warm, cool breeze like waves warm or cool breeze like waves. Bend your heads! You have to certify yourself! Bend your head fully! It is on top of the head not in front!

Now, put the left hand towards me! Put again your head down and see on top of your head, top of your head you see if there is a cool or warm breeze coming out. Some people get it very far and some get it very near.

Now, put your right hand towards me bend your head and from the left hand see for yourself! Now, raise both your hands and watch towards the sky! Now, ask a question, is this the cool breeze of the pure love of divinity? Ask this question three times! Now, please take your hands down!

All those who have felt cool breeze on their heads or warm breeze in their fingertips or in their hands or on top of their heads please raise both your hands! Please raise both your hands, please! Those who have felt cool breeze out of your heads or on your fingertips. Doesn't matter! Please raise both your hands! May God bless you!

Most of you have felt it. Some have not felt doesn't matter! They can feel also. All of them can feel it. Some have not felt it. Something not wrong but something has not worked out. So, it is important that you all should feel it. So, I would request you all to come to our follow on to the collective thing and I am sure all of you can feel it.

Some of you must be doubting, must be due to their conditioning. But how can you get cool breeze out of your head? Alright! Now, have faith in yourself! I'll be coming definitely after one year here. But as it is we have very nice people here who know a lot about Sahaj yoga. Then in the follow on in which you must come.
