"Talk after fireworks", New York City (United States) July 4th, 1989

[Inaudible]

Shri Mataji: And they are completely under fear.

Also, their feelings of frightness give them a very left-sided mood. Secondly, the people are also very violent. Violent people are very few. But the ones who are frightened of them are many more. So because of that, those who are frightened also have another mood of left-side. So despite the- this place is so active, everything, you feel the left side here more than the right side.

First, I could not understand what was the reason. The people are very insecure, frightened, and also those who are having jobs are also sort of, a little bit insecure about the jobs. Like, New York is very insecure they say: "New York is the most insecure place in the country."

Now, when I went to Columbia, of course, there are murders, I mean there are killings every day, forty, but still, they said: "It's less insecure than New York."

I said: "Why?"

Thay said: "For a purpose, they kill. I got a repport that there's a union which wants to have more money. And then, the manager says no. Then they can go and kill the manager sometimes. In the manager's system labours, it's like that. But there is some purpose, there is some hatred, there is some reason. But here, anybody can kill anybody."

There's no rhyme and reasons and that's why there's so much of fright and fear.

So, first of all, I think for people who are working in New York, they should have no fear. Because if you have fears of any kind, then you cannot impress on these people. So the main thing for us is to decide on this point: if the Divine Power which is Paramchaitanya is doing everything, then we are protected and you should have no fear about anything. All the time, if you are under fear, nobody is going to be impressed. So, apart from anything else, first thing is fearlessness. There should be complete fearlessness. It doesn't mean daredevilry [unsure], it doesn't mean dauntlessness or anything like that. But in peace, a kind of peaceful fearlessness. 

There's a story about a Chinese ruling the state. There was a guru and the king wanted his cocks to go in the arena for fight, cock-fighting. So, he sent those two cocks to the guru to be trained. And after one month he went to fetch the cocks. And he found they were just standing quietly. So he told the guru: "How can they fight?" He said: "It's all right, take them."

So, he took these two cocks and put them in the arena. Now, all the cocks tried to fight with them and tried to frighten them. Nothing happened, they were just standing quietly. So, these cocks started wondering: "What's the matter here? They are not fighting, they are not staying back [unsure]. They stood in their own silence, beautifully." Afterwards, all the cocks run away, these two remained. That's how they wan in this.

In the same way, we have to be. Let people attack, let people do what they like, nothing will happen if you have that sense of security. So the first thing that is needed is the sense of security so that we are not just the same as others are. We are not just the same as other American people in New York are. We are different people. We are people who are universal. We are people who are secure, we are people who are righteous. We are virtuous and protected by this Paramchaitanya. So they have to see that difference. They have to see: "These are very different, they are not just the same."

If you behave in the same manner as they behave, if you talk in the same manner as they do. If you have the same kind of apprehensions, then how will they be impressed?

Because you have to have some different personality which will show the essence of the something solid [inaudible]. That serenity, that dignity and that sense of security must be expressed in your life, everyday life. Say, you are going to office. Everybody is hurrying, everybody is mad. It's pointless to go into this process. [Unsure]

Like, I've seen myself, supposing, I have to go to the airport, then everybody's muscles start, you see, clutching. [Laughter]

I have to go. They are all mad. I say: "I – am- going - you are not going! So, take it easy." Everybody is panic. "Baba, I am going, you are not going!" Still. And they are so nervous, in that nervousness they'll put something here, something there. And then, ultimately, they'll find, they've forgotten it. It could be so.

So, that nervousness has to go out. After all, at the most, what will happen? At the most? At the most, you will miss the plane, but doesn't matter, you see. All right, at the most what is going to happen to our life? We are going to die. [Laughter]

I mean, we are going to die in any case.

So, if you have this kind of tranquil atmosphere around you, people will be surprised that: "How is it they are so tranquil? How is it they can bear it up while we get so upset?"

This is one side of a Sahaja Yogi character, he is at peace with himself. If anybody says anything: "It's all right, you'll be all right, let's do it." Even if they are angry or saying anything harsh, there is no need to shout it back. But also, that doesn't mean that you should become lethargic. You should be dynamic! You should be absolutely dynamic! But in that dynamism, your compassion should show. To express your compassion also, you need lots of dynamism. It's a thing I have experienced myself that to express my compassion, I have to be very dynamic.

Also, not only dynamism but also to be extremely wise. If I have to live with you individually or if I have to live with the whole community, if any problem is there, I have to do it in such a way that it doesn't break anything and it just flows. So this kind of a wisdom you have to give and the responsibility part. That you have to be responsible. You have to be responsible about your Self. The rest of the thing is all right. Just you are responsible about your Self, mature enough and wise enough.

Talking to anyone, in your communication with anyone, you have to understand that it has to be in such a way that the person feels your sincerity and that you communicate, you communicate with others. You are not afraid of communicating, you should not be shy of communication. Go and meet them, talk to anyone.

That's what I saw now, this Dulio, you see. There's one thing I was telling him about. See now, he is not a Portuguese. He's not a Portuguese [?], but he just rushed to his friends Brazilian. There he went and found out what is the cultural thing, this, that, knocked at ten doors. Ultimately, he found one who answered, he got hold of him. And then he organized the whole thing. And you'll be surprised, in a place like Brazilia, which is absolutely unknown to Me, I didn't know also that they have changed their capital, there I found about a thousand people sitting in a very big hall. It's all done by this boy who just said: "Now, I have to do it." That chat with this person, that chat with another person, did everything and brought them. So this is what he's for that we have to understand. And if he can see the importance of Sahaja Yoga, then we'll work it out. 

That is much more important than meditating all the time, there are people who meditate for two or three hours! And I don't know what you can do, only ten minutes are sufficient. We haven't got time event to finish it.

[Laughter]

This is what it is. If you realize this that you have to know: "Why are you meditating? For what?" Be dynamic. So why are you, just for meditation's sake you are meditating? Why are you developing that personality? Why do you evolve, for what? Just to meditate?

Just to meditate? It's something much more, much more. You see, it is like having a – supposing, we come to this place, for what? To see them. If you come here and sit down nicely meditating, you would not see them.

[Laughter]

So, meditation is all right but it's just for a purpose, for your ascent. And ascent is, in these modern times, not for yourself. You are not in the Himalaya, you are among people, you have to save, work hard. And you know how your Mother works, works very hard and you should also try this.

I don't know, the question is money-wise also, people are little miserly that's what I heard about New York people. [Inaudible] you should not be miserly also. Next morning we'll pay a double amount, you'll get a double amount. I promise to all.

We went through so many experiences. This Dulio had very little money with that he went there in Brazilia, did everything and came to [Inaudible] after. And guess what, before coming here he got such a big contract, he paid [unsure] the hotel for five million dollars.

Shri Mataji aside: Five billion?

Sahaja Yogi: Million.

Shri Mataji: Million dollars. [Inaudible]

So, this is what one has to understand: too much calculations all the time about money, how to do, how to work it out, that doesn't help. So, once you start thinking: "What I can do first of all?" After all, you see, you are not paying to the Guru, you are not paying for this- but you have to pay for a certain purpose, say, you have to pay for the house, you have to pay for this, for that. You should be generous. Generosity pays very well. All those who have been generous must have seen beggars [unsure]. But this miserliness is very wrong.

Then the second thing is that you see, the people who are managing money are extremely honest. Of course, we had some dishonest people, they have gone out [inaudible], but they are extremely honest and they are managing money very well, they are doing everything under my control. One should not doubt about it. So people have a habit of: "[Inaudible] this money, all their money". Not a single "paisa" [Indian cent] that you are spending is wasted. Take it from Me. To ask such a question is a wrong thing, at least blasphemy. It's absolute blasphemy.

One should not ask questions which are not for the [inaudible]. So there are certains things one has to understand, how far to go. It's not a show, it's not an organization, it's not a corporation, it's a body. It's a body, together. And whatever you are spending, where it goes, for what it goes- say, supposing, now you have a heart. Blood goes to the heart and it goes to the brain. The job of the heart is to take the blood to the brain. The brain has to see to the whole nervous system. If the brain starts asking the heart and the heart starts asking the liver then it's [inaudible] any body. You have to trust all of them. If you – of course, sometimes, it's possible, one part is sick- all right. You remove that or do something about it, you repair it. But you should not go and asking: "What happened there? Who is there? This is there. This is a sign you are not collective at all. In the collective, you are just like in the sea. We should not bother as what the leader has bought. Actually, sometimes, I'm amazed, some people are so generous!

Like Brigit, you see. She paid for the whole of my tour, the whole of my tour in the south. She said: "I don't want to buy anything anymore Mother. I just what to spend every "paisa" that I have for this." And her husband has not given it, it's from her father whatever money she spent. She's not bothered about her future, she's not bothered about money. Of course, when I discovered it I said: "No, we have to arrange that, we'll arrange it." But such a great thing to see that without doubt anymore, without anything, she secretly did the whole thing. Suddenly I discovered!

And the last but not least is the communication between all of you. No leader should think they are beyond communication. This was a very big mistake. And leaders have a habit to think that they are very important people and they cannot talk to you. Very important, they have no time for you. That’s a very big point, and that one should not be at all. You are the most unimportant person as far as communication is concerned. It’s like a telephone saying that: "I cannot communicate with you". You are there for communications, that's your job. You are there only for communication and nothing else. You have no other purpose other nature. Because I can communicate through the leader to other people, that’s why you are there, and if you have no communication with others, you are absolutely good for nothing.

So, the leaders should tell them: "Talk to each other, find out." You should tell them, say, what you are going to do: "Now it's easter puja, let's do it together, let's do it to work it out". Nothing should be decided arbitrarily: "We want to buy this, we want to send this present, we want to send this message" Outwardly. This is the way it will work. And the communication should be absolutely- I mean, we have so many Sahaja Yogis but I know most of them. I mean when there's a new one, I will meet some others [unsure]. But still, I 'll get their [inaudible] I'll know them. I must know all of them, who they are, what they are.

So, you have to know who are those, what are their problems are, what, how they are carrying on, everything. And the communication should be complete. Now, communication should be like in America. You have now Carolyn Vance. Carolyn has to see everyone, he must know all of you. He must know all your problems and he should be in complete contact with you. In the meantime, if anybody telephones, he should not say: "I'm busy, sir." He is to be available. That's why only the communication can be established, it's like, you can say, the telephone exchange, little difference.

A telephone exchange doesn't get heat in the head, doesn't it? That: "I am the leader." And if you have no time, then you are not a leader. If you have no communication, you are not. Communication is the main point which is lacking in a place like, in New York, in a place like other places here which is absolutely absurd because New York or San Diego or LA or any place are part and parcel of the Vishudhi chakra. The Vishudhi is for communication. We shake hands, we give vibrations, everything with the Vishudhi chakra.

So, if you are not good at communication it's not good. Also among yourselves. You must have communication, you must know about each other, you must talk to them also people are in need, go and see them, call them sometimes. You must know their birthdays, you must send them some wishes. I mean, there are people who do not send Me wishes even if they know Me for years.

So we have to send good wishes to them, we should ask them - then there are poems, there are beautiful poems to read, they should be circulated. You should know what's going on. It's like one body. You should know about each thing, whatever is happening, and with God what is their experiences, your experiences. And this is another thing which has started is absolutely difficult in suggesting that we are at Vishudhi because we are starting this Cool Breeze.

So, Gregoire, I would say that let it be printed there, let them do. Now he's there, he has not coming here, I'll go.

So, now, this Cool Breeze has started, imagine! I mean so many communications. Now, if you find anything wrong in that Coolbreeze, you think is wrong, instead of jumping about it, you see, you may write to the editor, you may write to the people that: "I think this could have been this way." But don't have a critical eye. Sahaja Yogis have to give up critical eyes completely about it. Because we see all the small, small things with others and we go as saints [unsure] with them.

As Christ has said that you don't see such a big beam in your eyes. That's what absolutely is there and in communication, you should see the good points of others. And the better part of it is that when you start seeing the good points of others, you imbibe them. That's so sweet, you know, to see something sweet about others and something very cute. Somebody will [inaudible] that person has this quality, some person has this quality. It's something so joy-giving, a joy that everybody will have. But you feel as if you really enjoy the person and if you eat some good food, you enjoy it. You see something beautiful, you enjoy it. You smell something, you enjoy it.

Now, you have one more, what you call that a sense organ, that sense organ is vibrations. Once you feel the cool vibrations about the people, just enjoy. But, supposing there's something wrong with him. So you should not abhor that person: "You are a bhoot, you don't come, you're this." There is no business in this way to talk to each other: "You are no good, you'd better not come, you are absolutely useless. You don't do this, you don't do that." This is not the way. Then you discourage others. Also, if somebody wants to do something, supposing a new person: "I can do like this. I can go to the newspaper, I can work it out." "No, no, no, not you." It is not proper. Keep it open, keep your heart open. Keep yourself open. Whatever somebody wants to do: "All right, go ahead, do it! You have it." 

What is there to be cautious, what is going to happen to yourself at the most, I mean, at the most?

Supposing someone says: "I'll write to the newpaper."

"All right, go ahead." They're not going to arrest him. What are they going to do to him?

When we are cautious we should know what's going to happen to them? Supposing, supposing he does something, what is there? What's going to happen?

So that you only have to change your attitude towards yourself and towards others. And it's very simple to understand, very simple. Anybody asks Me, I say: "All right go ahead." Why do you want something to happen? [Unsure]. Like they said: "We have a puja." I said: "Go ahead." And now we are having puja on the day, what is going to go wrong?

I mean, what is going to go wrong? At the most, supposing, the most top of the top [unsure], that will not because you are doing puja, but supposing, [inaudible]?

[Laughter]

So, in everything, you have to take it as a clown, so what, there's a lot of clowns [unsure]

If you develop that attitude about everyone about everything, it's simple. If you give up your criticizing actually, criticizing is the worse of all. If you start criticizing others, then it can not work.

And then, last of all is communication. "Don't do that. Don't do this, don't do this." This can go too much. A deter rule is there, we are all Sahaja Yogis, doesn't matter. Say, supposing I'll crush this, possibly that I'll make a sound. So what? It's all right. "But you are not supposed to do this, you're not-" you'll mock at this only. And after all, you have a body, something will happen, doesn't matter.

[Laughter]

So one should take a very, very liberal view of the whole thing and take it aloud [inaudible]. And the keynote of Sahaja Yoga is compassion. The keynote of Sahaja Yoga is compassion and the expression of compassion is the only way you can communicate. No other way. If you can keep this in mind, then I'm sure you'll understand.

Just you have to show your compassion among Sahaja Yogis. I mean, just imagine, I'm not worldly-wise [unsure], so many things, I mean I'm looking at so many things, you see.

But there's one thing I'm good actually, is to communicate my love, that's all. I mean you, people, have just seen Me, met Me, maybe some of you have even shaken hands with Me. You all love Me. Why?

Because I love you, that's why. And you know that. In the same way, if you love someone, you won't criticize, you won't say harsh things, you won't say anything to upset anyone and gradually, if you have to say also, you'll say it in such a beautiful manner that that person can take it. That person can understand. Because the most precious thing is the love which [inaudible] between the two persons and all. No love should be lost at any cost. There is something like a habit of being sarcastic all the time, something funny all the time. Convert it into something very interesting like, if you have a habit of saying something sarcastic, make a joke at yourself. It's very good. Make fun of yourself and at others, then you'll start saying something.

Let [inaudible] this culture, [inaudible] these Sahaj manners. This is very sweet.
