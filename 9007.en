About leadership

"And the last but not least is the communication between all of you. No leader should think they are beyond communication. This was a very big mistake. And leaders have a habit to think that they are very important people and they cannot talk to you. Very important, they have no time for you. That's a very big point, and that one should not be at all. You are the most unimportant person as far as communication is concerned. It's like a telephone saying that I cannot call you. You are there only for communication and nothing else. You have no other purpose other nature. Because I can communicate through the leader to other people, that's why you are there, and if you have no communication with others, you are absolutely good for nothing."
