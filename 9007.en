"Talk after fireworks", New York City (United States) July 4th, 1989

[Inaudible]

Shri Mataji: And they are completely under fear.

So their feelings of frightness give them a very left-sided mood. Secondly, the people are also very violent. Violent people are very few. But the ones who are frightened of them are many more. So because of that, those who are frightened also have another mood of left-side. So despite the- this place is so active, everything, you feel the left side here more than the right side.

First, I could not understand what was the reason. The people are very insecure, frightened, and also those who are having jobs are also sort of, a little bit insecure about the jobs. Like, New York is very insecure they say: "New York is the most insecure place in the country."

Now, when I went to Columbia, of course, there are murders, I mean there are killings every day, forty, but still, they said: "It's less insecure than New York."

I said: "Why?"

Thay said: "For a purpose, they kill. I got a repport that there's a union which wants to have more money. And then, the manager says no. Then they can go and kill the manager sometimes. In the manager's system labours, it's like that. But there is some purpose, there is some hatred, there is some reason. But here, anybody can kill anybody."

There's no rhyme and reasons and that's why there's so much of fright and fear.

So, first of all, I think for people who are working in New York, they should have no fear. Because if you have fears of any kind, then you cannot impress on these people. So the main thing for us is to decide on this point: if the Divine Power which is Paramchaitanya is doing everything, then we are protected and you should have no fear about anything. All the time, if you are under fear, nobody is going to be impressed. So, apart from anything else, first thing is fearlessness. There should be complete fearlessness. It doesn't mean daredevilry [unsure] , it doesn't mean dauntlessness or anything like that. But in peace, a kind of peaceful fearlessness.

There's a story about a Chinese ruling the state. There was a guru and the king wanted his cocks to go in the arena for fight, cock-fighting. So, he sent those two cocks to the guru to be trained. And after one month he went to fetch the cocks. And he found they were just standing quietly. So he told the guru: "How can they fight?" He said: "It's all right, take them."

So, he took these two cocks and put them in the arena. Now, all the cocks tried to fight with them and tried to frighten them. Nothing happened, they were just standing quietly. So, these cocks started wondering: "What's the matter here? They are not fighting, they are not staying back [unsure]. They stood in their own silence, beautifully." Afterwards, all the cocks run away, these two remained. That's how they wan in this.

In the same way, we have to be. Let people attack, let people do what they like, nothing will happen if you have that sense of security. So the first thing that is needed is the sense of security so that we are not just the same as others are. We are not just the same as other American people in New York are. We are different people. We are people who are universal. We are people who are secure, we are people who are righteous. We are virtuous and protected by this Paramchaitanya. So they have to see that difference. They have to see: "These are very different, they are not just the same."

If you behave in the same manner as they behave, if you talk in the same manner as they do. If you have the same kind of apprehensions, then how will they be impressed?

Because you have to have some different personality which will show the essence of the something solid [inaudible]. That serenity, that dignity and that sense of security must be expressed in your life, everyday life. Say, you are going to office. Everybody is hurring, everybody is mad. It's pointless to go into this process. [Unsure]

Like, I've seen myself, supposing, I have to go to the airport, then everybody's muscles start, you see, clutching.

[Laughter]

I have to go. They are all mad. I say: "I – am- going - you are not going!" So, take it easy. Everybody is panic. "Baba, I am going, you are not going!" Still. And they are so nervous, in that nervousness they'll put something here, something there. And then, ultimately, they'll find, they've forgotten it.

So, that nervousness has to go out. After all, at the most, what will happen? At the most? At the most, you will miss the plane, but doesn't matter, you see. All right, at the most what is going to happen to our life? We are going to die. [Laughter]

I mean, we are going to die in any case.

So, if you have this kind of tranquil atmosphere around you, people will be surprised that: "How is it they are so tranquil? How is it they can bear it up while we get so upset?"

This is one side of a Sahaja Yogi character, he is at peace with himself. If anybody says anything: "It's all right, you'll be all right, let's do it." Even if they are angry or saying anything harsh, there is no need to shout it back. But also, that doesn't mean that you should become lethargic. You should be dynamic! You should be absolutely dynamic! But in that dynamism, your compassion should show. To express your compassion also, you need lots of dynamism. It's a thing I have experienced myself that to express my compassion, I have to be very dynamic.

Also, not only dynamism but also to be extremely wise. If I have to live with you individually or if I have to live with the whole community, if any problem is there, I have to do it in such a way that it doesn't break anything and it just flows. So this kind of a wisdom you have to give and the responsibility part. That you have to be responsible. You have to be responsible about your Self. The rest of the thing is all right. Just you are responsible about your Self, mature enough and wise enough.

Talking to anyone, in your communication with anyone, you have to understand that it has to be in such a way that the person feels your sincerity and that you communicate, you communicate with others. You are not afraid of communicating, you should not be shy of communication. Go and meet them, talk to anyone?

That's what I saw now, this, arlier, you see, That's one thing I was thinking about. See now, Nil is not a Portuguese, he's not a Portuguese ?, but he just rushed to his friend Brazilian. There he went and found out what is the cultural thing, this, that, knocked at ten doors. Ultimately, he found one who answered, he got hold of him. And then he organized the whole thing. And you'll be surprised, in a place like Brazilia, which is absolutely unknown to Me, I didn't know also that they have changed their capital, there he found about a thousand people sitting in a very big hall. It is all done by this boy who just setteld the whole thing: that chatt with this person, that chatt with another person [unsure], did everything and brought in. So this is what he's [inaudible]. And if he can see the importance of Sahaja Yoga, then we'll work it out. That is much more important than meditating all the time, there are people who meditate for two or three hours! And I don't know what you can do, only ten minutes are sufficient. We haven't got time event to finish it.

[Laughter]

This is what it is. If you realize this that you have to know: "Why are you meditating? For what?" Be dynamic. So why are you, just for meditation's sake you are meditating? Why are you developping that personality? Why do you evolve, for what? Just to meditate?

Just to meditate? It's something much more. You see, it is like having a – supposing, we come to this place, for what? To see them. If you come here and sit down nicely meditating, you would not see them.

[Laughter]

So, meditation is all right but it's just for a purpose, for your ascent. And acent is, in these modern times, not for yourself. You are not in the Himalaya, you are among people, you have to save,work hard. And you know how your Mother works, works very hard and you should also try this [unsure].
