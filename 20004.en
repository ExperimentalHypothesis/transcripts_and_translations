Evening Program, Sahaj Yogiyon Ko Upadesh

Shri Mataji:I have to respect all the people who have come all the way from all other countries... for one thing ...I am sorry that you see that there has been no proper direction to these people and they occupied all the buses and so many foreigners were left behind...There were 5 buses for foreigners. Only one bus for the Indians...5 buses for the foreigners except for one bus which is ...What is the number?7965, That was the only bus for Indians. The rest of the 5 buses are for foreigners. So you please don't get into that bus ...And the driver's name is Mr Patil ...Maybe there is some other Patil but this number you remember So this is the bus for ...There are five buses for you ...So tomorrow these people have to shift to another place There tents we have to shift to another place ...So they will be moving from your place to this place ...And if you could help them with their luggage It will be very kind of you ...After breakfast, they have to move from there and come down this side ...So Please also help them because we tried to get the tampon and all that...But you know this is a place we are actually in a jungle ...And here we have to help each other So you try to help them. Bring all their luggage and put them in the tents ...That's how we will become friends ...and that's how we will become collective. So to get to collectivity we should try to help each other ...See what is wanted, what they need? Now its the duty of all the leaders to see that all the people get into the buses and they are here in time ...the first program tomorrow will be for the foreigners, will be get up about say 7:30 or so or 8:00 o'clock if you want and then to sit for meditation and then go for breakfast, finish the breakfast and then you can go to the sea if you like and move back to your tents. And tomorrow if you can avoid swimming then you can help them to carry the luggage and things...You have been doing swimming quite a lot so it's all right if you could avoid tomorrow fora while to settle them down ...and to help them with the tents also ...They are not so much use to of tents ...So if you can help them with the tents...will be a good idea.How many of you know how to pitch a tent?Ah! great number ...Alright so you all have to help tomorrow to pitch the tents...Will be a good idea ...If you will allow I will also come to help you. I know how to pitch?:) I really know. My father was a hard taskmaster. We can't say- I can't do something ...Why can't you do it?I know how to pitch a tent ... it's not so difficult ...But I don't know now If you would like me to do it or not but ...In any case, I would request you to help them and to carry their luggage and pitch their tents and transfer them from that place to another place where we are going to pitch the tents.Let's have a cooperative business...And if you want, then you can go for swimming or anything...Till about I think 12:30, the buses will be there 12:30, they will start plying ...You all come along here and settle down for your lunch tomorrow ...This is only for tomorrow...This is the program for tomorrow ...Then you have your Lunch ...If you want you can rest or if want to go back in your buses ...rest there...And then the tea will be sent to you ... Have your tea and be ready and you can come tomorrow by about 6:00- 6:30. We will start the program at 6:30.6:30-8:00 O'clock we will have something bout Sahaja yoga and then you can have your dinner after dinner we will have some music and after the music, you can go back and sleep ...After that every morning you have to get up and have a meditation in the morning proper meditation and then we can have our breakfast or the other way round whichever way you like. That you decide with Mr. ...Anyone of the trustees who are here organising and you know Mr Pradhan is doing everything but whatever it is your leader must talk to them. And decide what is to be done before breakfast or after breakfast ...And then you go for your swim...come back have your baths everything, be ready and you should be here about 10:30 or 11:00 o'clock at the most ...Then we can have some program in the morning also...11:00 to say 1:00 o'clock ...1:00 o'clock we will have lunch...We go back, take some rest, and then we will come back again ...in the evening time about 6:00, or 6:30. Is it clear now?Because otherwise we will be just singing and swimming, nothing in between ...We are here for the seminar And in the seminar, one has to learn a lot ...

Moreover, there are inconveniences I know and there are problems because it's such a far fetched place and this time we have tried to organise through the Sahaja yogis all the things, but doesn't matter things are working out ...And it's quite nice ...Nobody is going to starve ...Nobody is going to be harmed ...in any way ...But we should know that we are in a pilgrimage.So be in a mediative mood! Enjoy all that and don't worry about your physical discomforts or troubles ...And if there is any problem so far, that will be solved now...So you should organise also ...There are five buses somebody should be in charge,see that, you make all of them sit there, bring them here if somebody is left out. You can send the bus back ...Now you are sitting down here and they are all standing in there ...For 4 hours they have been standing...You should find out If they have arrived or not ...Where are they? And some of them were looking very angry. I just ran away ...Legitimately you see...Now, Swagat ...

[Apology is made by the anchor Sahaja yogi to those who found it difficult to reach there]Poor man, he is doing all the work himself 24 hours he is working 24 hours he is organising ...Why should he apologized ...Those who have done nothing should apologize...I think hmm...Things are alright, the only thing we must see that others are convenience others are looked after, others are in time and we are all together ...You can't leave your hand behind and come here ...Can you?

So now they want to do a welcome song to me ...I don't know where are the musician ...We can have some foreigners ..."Swagat agat song."Come along! Come along!We will have ..."Swagat agat " till they come ...Come along! come up here!Swiss speed needed...Swiss speed ...:)No No not in this case ...not in this case ...

Some here and some this side ...Let the ladies sit here and you sit there ...And you can remove that pot on the sides ...The ladies sit this side ...So Indians ousted you on the Buses ...We will oust them in the Music...:)Come along come along fast Otherwise dangers will be coming now ...:):)Come here come here...Are you alright! You like it! han...You went to the sea...Good ...How is that boy who is suffering from that kind of a ...Han...No body has to go to the sea, in the afternoon...If you go Shri Ganesha is sitting there ...With the big ...What you call ...in EnglishThe one who has got...Axe ...He is sitting with an axe if you go there I don't know I am not responsible ...I am telling you...Nobody should go ...after 12:00 o'clock...You can go in the evening ...Do you want to go? My responsibility is till 11:00 a.m...:)Not at 4:00 or 5:00 o'clock no, no5:30 alright!5:30 you won't have time ...Weather is too much ...See Weather...Just imagine that you are sitting in the sea that's all.Alright! Let's have it!(Then Shri Mataji enjoys the Music )Shri Mataji: Now we can break for dinner! Though foreigners have to go! I am sorry Foreigners and Indians are regarded as a respectable term I hope you don't mind ...Its regarded very respectable in India ...If somebody is foreigner you must treat him with great respect and love and he is like a guest ...He is like God...in the country...See that's what our ideas are ...So when I call you foreigner I am actually ...It's a very honourable position to be a foreigner in India...So I would request all of you to go and have your dinner and then the Indians can go later on ...You are our guests according to them ...Thank you very much!
