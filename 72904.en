She was a. And during your whole speech vibrations were so fresh, so fresh, all the. Yeah, really. But just for now. That's very good. They come back and they're really tiny. 3 Istra also. Is a lot. Uh, but we did it. Mother, they all, I, because I was on the, on the stage, I could see the faces and they were what amazed me mother that I said.

I as I talk to the people in the car, I was really touched because I mean my my German is not. For the young man to speak that like because it was the video, the introduction. I didn't, I didn't have any room. No one never clapped you in many things when they were into that. This is the first time I was very happy, so I also clapped, so I. now one thing I want to tell you that when haemoglobin react or do anything wrong, it really bodily harm was, I believe.

It still touch my, but if anybody else does anything that can help. But you be sure because you're part and parcel of everything you do anything that helps. You know, so now remember for all of you that don't try to put any negative things before me. If you have, you go plan for yourself, come back, but don't send me any negative thought anymore, all right? If you have a problem, you try to raise your hand, all right, never.

I'm just like. I think really that far as all the way this. programme in general took place has proven that you have now started surgery around another dimension that we just move a little finger and everything moves up. But you want basically. And I'm going, you also go with me. I'm writing. I'm not saying all that. So, don't talk of small things, top of this. Just don't talk. Don't think of something.

First Yeah. What a dilation. In one shot so many for the first time they came and they got the. It is just hard yellow, it was fantastic. But I didn't agree, but the way it has happened here not happened. That that generally also. I They were, they said, I feel it's all over to journalists. Who was here today. She was. She was here this evening.

She said, I said, did you feel? She said, Oh yes, all over. The photographer didn't think about that. Yes, she did. She, she did. She did. She didn't. Very much. I asked the the journalists. And journalist said that she has, but the photographer didn't because she, she was, uh, she had her attention and this is what she told me she got it here, but not the problem.

This is what she said. I'm I asked both of them, both of them told me. So she. It was the way I spoke to at the class also. And we have which one was the photographs there which one is it's the back that I was I was it like. your granddaughter? No, I don't know. I just had a. Mhm Which was Um, it's a red.

I've seen it just got out whether it's a thing or not, I've seen one where we, I think in your house you've never had a coloured thing but one of your photographers got the colour. So I want to ask question, do you have any anything behind?

It's white. Oh, my favourite is right that I was writing my myself. How this background. It's so good. I mean, the solicity of it right now is so great, isn't it? And you can't get how you look this colour. I don't think the ball had any such colour like that. So Well in fact I did well was yellowish. the photographs and yellowish. That's why.

So all that is and just check this colour. So I called before. The extraordinary thing is that there's dark and lightning in such a way it emphasises the because you get life from both sides, you see, and that has come out from the point of view of an art. All things So So just when I looking less straight. That is the corner of this side, all of my people. In the corner of my eye. On your respective posts on that. No Let's see the part. That's right.

I just started to. is Cuban and every time he wants to go out of Italy for now, they don't want to give him the visa to go back to Italy though he's there for 8 years and he would like to apply for Italian nationality, but the Cuban government would not give him. Papers necessary because he's a kind of refugee so maybe if you give a ban. It could have nationalistic. But the TVs always have a, a bra like all these people are thinking, you know, what we have this from TV. But he's not a real refugee in the sense that he still has the Cuban passport. Yeah. Did you? And ask of you.

political and they do. No, he would not receive it because he stayed too long in Italy. Well, you, you can't say that. I don't want to want to see what. What is it?
