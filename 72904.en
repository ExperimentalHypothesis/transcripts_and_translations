Gregoire's Flat, Vienna (Austria)
Talk Language: English | Transcript (English) - In Progress

Sahaja Yogini: And nobody put a question, as they were thoughtless.
Shri Mataji: And I waited for ten minutes [unclear]. I tell you, because what was going on outside [unclear]
And that lady came back, the wife, I think.
Gregoire: Yes?
Shri Mataji: Yes, she came back.
Gregoire: With reddish hair?
Shri Mataji: Hum. She went out and came back. I saw her coming back. She must be annoyed; she must have blasted you.
Sahaja Yogi: She was annoyed, when she got up, [unclear], she was unhappy about it.

Sahaja Yogini: And during your voice speech vibrations were so fresh, so fresh, all the time.
Shri Mataji: I know, they are really too much. But just for now [unclear].
A very good speech, very compact and very timely, very timely. I touched Sahasrara also, quite a lot. But mainly, the soul [unsure].

Gregoire: You were- the whole time, because I was on the stage, I could see the faces. And it quite amazed me, Mother, that I seldom could see, in such a crowd, an amount of people who were so respectful and eager to receive something. I was just amazed.
Shri Mataji: Did they clap for your lecture? Just imagine, they did not clap for Me.
This is for you, the clap, [unclear].
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, I heard it.
Shri Mataji: Really sweet of them.
Gregoire: They were sweet. As I talked to the people in the car, I was really touched, because I mean, generally is not that response.
Shri Mataji: They were very much touched by your lecture, you know? For a young man, to speak on that, they were surprised.
Gregoire: You didn’t know that we did an introduction?
Sahaja Yogi: I didn't have any room.

Shri Mataji: No one never clapped, you see, in any case, when there is an introduction. This is the first time, I was very happy, so I also clapped. So I didn't understand what I was doing.
[Laughter]

Shri Mataji: So, one thing I want you to tell you, that when Sahaja Yogis, you see, react or do anything wrong, it really, my body is harmed, actually, and believe Me, it gives such [unclear]. But if anybody else does anything, nothing can touch Me. But you, because you are part and parcel of Me, anything you do, anything, that harms Me, in a way. So now remember, for all of you, that don't try to do any negative things before Me. If you have, you go, cleanse yourself, come back. But don't tell Me any negative thought anymore, all right? If you have a problem, raise your hands. All right. Never any negative things will be close to Mother.

And nothing negative, I cannot do that. You do it, all right. But it's coming through, it's not [unclear] Because you are part and parcel of Me. My eyes start spinning [unsure] for that people. You are my eyes, you are my heart, you are my everything.

[Unclear] it doesn’t matter. I just laugh. But as Sahaja Yogi, you must remember that I have given you a place in my body, in my being, in my heart. The slightest movement if you make against the rhythm of my body, it possesses you. You should never trouble Me anymore.

You think about [unclear]. Just think about how it should be done.
You decide today, it works out. Just say, "Oh, Mother, let there be no action of ours, which is not in complete concord with your rhythm".
Sahaja Yogis: "Oh, Mother, let there be no action of ours, which will not be in complete concord with your rhythm".

So, today is the day of environment. You know [unsure] how in the whole world, how they put a lot. So, let's have some champagne, all right?
[Laughter]
To the help of the [unclear] people, and to the help of Austrians.
May God bless you.
So, cheers! Well done, good. 

Shri Mataji: This is a real stuff? [Unclear part]
Gregoire, the countryside gets flowers.

Gregoire: Mother, I think really the floraison is on. The way this program in Viena took place has proven that you have now started Sahaja Yoga on another dimension.
Shri Mataji: All right.
Gregoire: That you just move a little finger and everything moves out.
Shri Mataji: But you all people should lead.
Gregoire: Yes, it’s true, Mother.
Shri Mataji: As I'm growing, you also grow with Me.
I'm writing all this. I'm not giving you a strain on that. So big. Don't talk of small things, talk of big things. Just don't talk of small things, don't think of small things. Finished.

Such a dimension. In one shot, so many of them, for the first time they came, and they got Realisation. In this horrible Europe, it gives fantastic [unclear].
Such a [unclear] you are doing, because, but the way it has happened here, it never happened nowhere.
That journalist also got it.
Gregoire: Yes. They were, they said, "I feel it all over ", the journalist who was here today. Sahaja Yogi: She was here today?
Gregoire: She was here this evening, I said, "Did you feel it?" She said, "Oh yes, all over". Another Sahaja Yogi: The photographer didn't feel all that.
Gregoire: Yes, she did. She did.
Shri Mataji: She did, very much. What makes you think?
Another Sahaja Yogi: I asked the journalist and journalist said that she has felt, but the photographer didn't because she had her attention disturbed. This is what she told me.
