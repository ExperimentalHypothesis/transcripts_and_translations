Gregoire's Flat, Vienna (Austria)
Talk Language: English | Transcript (English) - In Progress, Transcript (English) – Draft

Sahaja Yogini: And nobody put a question, as they were thoughtless.
Shri Mataji: And I waited for ten minutes [unclear]. I tell you, because what was going on outside [unclear]
And that lady came back, the wife, I think.
Gregoire: Yes?
Shri Mataji: Yes, she came back.
Gregoire: With reddish hair?
Shri Mataji: Hum. She went out and came back. I saw her coming back. She must be annoyed; she must have blasted you.
Sahaja Yogi: She was annoyed, when she got up, [unclear], she was unhappy about it.

Sahaja Yogini: And during your voice speech vibrations were so fresh, so fresh, all the time.
Shri Mataji: I know, they are really too much. But just for now [unclear].
A very good speech, very compact and very timely, very timely. I touched Sahasrara also, quite a lot. But mainly, the soul [unsure].

Gregoire: You were- the whole time, because I was on the stage, I could see the faces. And it quite amazed me, Mother, that I seldom could see, in such a crowd, an amount of people who were so respectful and eager to receive something. I was just amazed.
Shri Mataji: Did they clap for your lecture? Just imagine, they did not clap for Me.
This is for you, the clap, [unclear].
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, I heard it.
Shri Mataji: Really sweet of them.
Gregoire: They were sweet. As I talked to the people in the car, I was really touched, because I mean, generally is not that response.
Shri Mataji: They were very much touched by your lecture, you know? For a young man, to speak on that, they were surprised.
Gregoire: You didn’t know that we did an introduction?
Sahaja Yogi: I didn't have any room.

Shri Mataji: No one never clapped, you see, in any case, when there is an introduction. This is the first time, I was very happy, so I also clapped. So I didn't understand what I was doing.
[Laughter]

Shri Mataji: So, one thing I want you to tell you, that when Sahaja Yogis, you see, react or do anything wrong, it really, my body is harmed, actually, and believe Me, it gives such [unclear]. But if anybody else does anything, nothing can touch Me. But you, because you are part and parcel of Me, anything you do, anything, that harms Me, in a way. So now remember, for all of you, that don't try to do any negative things before Me. If you have, you go, cleanse yourself, come back. But don't tell Me any negative thought anymore, all right? If you have a problem, raise your hands. All right. Never any negative things will be close to Mother.

And nothing negative, I cannot do that. You do it, all right. But it's coming through, it's not [unclear] Because you are part and parcel of Me. My eyes start spinning [unsure] for that people. You are my eyes, you are my heart, you are my everything.

[Unclear] it doesn’t matter. I just laugh. But as Sahaja Yogi, you must remember that I have given you a place in my body, in my being, in my heart. The slightest movement if you make against the rhythm of my body, it possesses you. You should never trouble Me anymore.

You think about [unclear]. Just think about how it should be done.
You decide today, it works out. Just say, "Oh, Mother, let there be no action of ours, which is not in complete concord with your rhythm".
Sahaja Yogis: "Oh, Mother, let there be no action of ours, which will not be in complete concord with your rhythm".

So, today is the day of environment. You know [unsure] how in the whole world, how they put a lot. So, let's have some champagne, all right?
[Laughter]
To the help of the [unclear] people, and to the help of Austrians.
May God bless you.
So, cheers! Well done, good. 

Shri Mataji: This is a real stuff? [Unclear part]
Gregoire, the countryside gets flowers.

Gregoire: Mother, I think really the floraison is on. The way this program in Viena took place has proven that you have now started Sahaja Yoga on another dimension.
Shri Mataji: All right.
Gregoire: That you just move a little finger and everything moves out.
Shri Mataji: But you all people should lead.
Gregoire: Yes, it’s true, Mother.
Shri Mataji: As I'm growing, you also grow with Me.
I'm writing all this. I'm not giving you a strain on that. So big. Don't talk of small things, talk of big things. Just don't talk of small things, don't think of small things. Finished.

Such a dimension. In one shot, so many of them, for the first time they came, and they got Realisation. In this horrible Europe, it gives fantastic [unclear].
Such a [unclear] you are doing, because, but the way it has happened here, it never happened nowhere.
That journalist also got it.
Gregoire: Yes. They were, they said, "I feel it all over ", the journalist who was here today. Sahaja Yogi: She was here today?
Gregoire: She was here this evening, I said, "Did you feel it?" She said, "Oh yes, all over". Another Sahaja Yogi: The photographer didn't feel all that.
Gregoire: Yes, she did. She did.
Shri Mataji: She did, very much. What makes you think?
Another Sahaja Yogi: I asked the journalist and journalist said that she has felt, but the photographer didn't because she had her attention disturbed. This is what she told me.

Shri Mataji: No, no but she got it here only.
Another Sahaja Yogi: Oh, she got it here, but not during the conference. This is what she said.
Gregoire: I asked both of them, both of them told me she felt.

Shri Mataji: [Unclear] But I don’t know because she came this evening.

There was a very nice photograph at the back, I saw it, on the hall. Which one was the photograph there?
Gregoire: Which one is it, Mother?
Shri Mataji: This is the back, where I was sitting.
Gregoire: How was it looking like?
Sahaja Yogini: Just show me. It’s so interesting.

Arnaud: Is this your granddaughter?
Shri Mataji: No, I don't know, I just had a [unclear]. Big one.
Guido: With a red shawl.
Shri Mataji: No, no.
Arnaud: This one?
[Unclear conversation]

Gregoire: This is the one. Do you know where they got it, Mother?
Shri Mataji: No, no. I don’t know, that’s why I ask.
Gregoire: At the first Sahaja Yoga seminar we had in Britain, in this castle. Do you remember?
Rustom: Of this time, so far.
Gregoire: Yes.
Shri Mataji: Very sweet. Again the same problem had worked out.
[Unclear part] I said, "This is that one".

Shri Mataji: First seminar, Gregoire?
Gregoire: Yes, Mother.
Shri Mataji: What year? In this platform. In which chapter?
Gregoire: 78.
Shri Mataji: Oh, I remember!
Gregoire: 78.
Shri Mataji: When we went to that near the church?
Rustom: Yes, the big house.
Gregoire: It was the first seminar we had in Wokingham [unsure].

Shri Mataji: It was arranged by this [unclear].
Gregoire: David [name unclear]? Yes. I don't remember.
Shri Mataji: When was this?
Rustom: 1978 it was.

Shri Mataji: This castle had no other [unclear] under.
Sahaja Yogi: That's correct.
Shri Mataji: At that time, somebody put lots of things [unclear].

[About a photo; conversation is quite unclear]
Shri Mataji: One eye is a little shadowed but the lips and the [unclear]. It’s very good for the [unclear]. You were there Gregoire?
Gregoire: Yes, Mother.

Shri Mataji: The background just drops out. I’ve seen it [unclear]. It just goes out. Whether it's a [unclear] or not, I’ve seen one where, I think, [unclear]?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Mother.
Shri Mataji: In your house, you never had a coloured piece?
Sahaja Yogi: No.
Shri Mataji: But one of you has got a coloured pattern.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.
Gregoire: Blue?
Shri Mataji: Blue. So, I want to ask you, do you have any blue behind it?
Sahaja Yogi: It's one [unclear] white.
Shri Mataji: I mean, this background is so good. It's so good, I mean the simplicity of the background is so great, isn't it?

Shri Mataji: And you can't get it away, [unclear] you can’t get this colour? I don't think the wall had any such colour like that. Like a [unclear].
Sahaja Yogi: Well, in fact, it is well yellowish.
Shri Mataji: Huh?
Sahaja Yogi: It goes to [unclear] some yellowish background.
Shri Mataji: On paper wall?
Sahaja Yogi: That's right.
Shri Mataj: So all that disappeared , [unclear] this colour, you see. All right, [unclear]
Rustom: The extraordinary thing, Shri Mataji, is that there's darkening and lightening in such a way that emphasizes the central thing.
Gregoire: Because you get light from both sides, you see? From left and from right.
Rustom: [Unclear]

Shri Mataji: Yes, and the colour that has come out is so well. I mean, you just see from the point of view of an art, you see, the whole thing is very lightening. It suggests one eye is looking less straight. That’s in the corner of this eye all my destructive forces are there. In the corner of my very [unclear]
Gregoire: All my?
Shri Mataji: Corner of my eye.
Gregoire: All your destructive forces are there.
Shri Mataji: Yes. Just see the point, that white.
Gregoire: Blueish white.
Shri Mataji: Blueish white, yes.
[Unclear part]

Gregoire: I told these people to come at ten o'clock.
[Unclear part]

Gregoire: Should I show you the metal luggage I have? Whether you would like to...
Shri Mataji: All right.
It's no problem. You see everything that you are doing. [Unclear part]
It’s very beautiful Just showing the country. Especially you could be really weak. And what about Alps? How do you cross? You don't have to cross Alps.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, we are crossing Alps.
Shri Mataji: And where do you cross?
Sahaja Yogi: But we are going through tunnels.
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Sahaja Yogi: We go through tunnels.
Shri Mataji: Through what?
Sahaja Yogi: Through tunnels.
Shri Mataji: Through tunnels.
Sahaja Yogi: Through tunnels, yes.
But we will not see anything because we are taking the train at 9 o'clock in the evening. So we will be sleeping it over. Maybe tomorrow morning we will see something.
Shri Mataji: Tomorrow morning.
Sahaja Yogi: But not very much. Tomorrow morning in Zurich. No after tomorrow morning in Zurich and then by noon, on Saturday, in Geneva.

Gregoire: Mother, this is the luggage.
Shri Mataji: Oh, that's all right. That’s very good. That's excellent! That's a excellent, excellent!
That's not very big.

Gregoire: We have to eat and ..
Shri Mataji: Is it steel?
Sahaja Yogi: It's aluminium. It should be aluminium.
Shri Mataji: Aluminium. It's not steel. It should be put in the aluminium.
[Unclear part]

Sahaja Yogi: May I ask you for - so Enzo is going to come to Geneva.
Shri Mataji: Who?
Sahaja Yogi: Enzo And then, Guido is going to come to Geneva. They would like to get a job there for at least a month or six weeks. May we ask you for bandhans, Mother, because it's very difficult to get a job there.
Shri Mataji: All right. Very difficult there.

It’s very difficult everywhere these days, you see. In England, there are so many problems.
And, you see, the way English people also use people. Just to get a job from there.
[Unclear] And I also felt, when you are talking to them, that they don't trust now Western people much. They are the only people who are given jobs now, higher salary. But they don’t trust so much Western people.

Sahaja Yogini: Mother [unclear] would you like to eat in your room?
Shri Mataji: It would be better in the room.
Sahaja Yogini: Yes, so I prepare it in your room.

Sahaja Yogini: Mother, may I ask you, Pedro is of Cuban nationality and every time he wants to go out of Italy, which in Sahaja Yoga happens quite often.
Shri Mataji: [Unclear]
Sahaja Yogini: Pedro is Cuban, and every time he wants to go out of Italy for Sahaja Yoga now, they don't want to give him the visa to go back to Italy, though he is there for eight years. And he would like to apply for Italian nationality. But the Cuban government would not give him all the papers necessary because he is a kind of refugee. So, maybe, if you give him a bandhan, he could have the Italian nationality.
Shri Mataji: But refugees always have a right. They got, [unclear] these people refugees, you know. What we have- these from Chili.
Sahaja Yogini: But he is not a real refugee in the sense that he still has the Cuban passport. Shri Mataji: Really?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.
Shri Mataji: [Unclear] Even he can ask for political asylum from [unclear].
Sahaja Yogini: But he would not receive it, because he stayed too long in Italy.
Shri Mataji: Of course, he can say that, "I don't want to go to Cuba". Anybody can ask for political asylum [unclear].

Shri Mataji: What is it?
Sahaja Yogi: There’s a big fly.
Sahaja Yogini: A very bad one.
Shri Mataji: A bad one?
Sahaja Yogi: [Unclear]

Shri Mataji: No, no, this is not that flower.
Sahaja Yogi: It is very big.
Sahaja Yogini: Very big and it is dangerous. Yes, it is dangerous.
Shri Mataji: Which one?
Sahaja Yogini: This one.
Shri Mataji: What is it called?
Sahaja Yogini: This one is called a hornet.
Shri Mataji: This is the same one, this one, [unclear].
Sahaja Yogini: It is a dangerous animal. A dangerous animal. He is still there.
Shri Mataji: How do we know?
Sahaja Yogi: It is behind.
Shri Mataji: Are you sure this is how it looks? Are you sure?
It is a wasp.
Sahaja Yogini: It is bigger. Bigger, it was big like that.

Shri Mataji: So what will you do? So it is a candy?
What are you doing there, Genevieve? Better see that that thing goes out. It’s still there behind that wall. People go open.
Sahaja Yogi: It’s behind the wall. Oh, it is up there.
Shri Mataji: You see, behind this wall. Take something and drive it out. Take that one.

Arnaud: Mother, may I use this one?
Shri Mataji: This way or this way?
Sahaja Yogini: I can see just behind.
Shri Mataji: From this side, open the door. Open the top door.

No door can be opened here. The door can't be opened, the upper one?
Gregore: Yes but there is another behind.
Shri Mataji: Doesn't matter. Both the doors open.
Just hit it from outside. But you have to simply hit. You have to hit just the outside of the thing. Outside of the thing. First open the window.
Be careful.

Sahaja Yogini: I can see it.
Shri Mataji: It's there, it is there. I can see it still there. So, near the second screw. All right, if it is not opening, leave it to Gregoire. You’d better kill it.
All right, you get down.
Sahaja Yogi: Okay, I see now. I see now. I see now.

Shri Mataji: All right. Just kill it between the two ears. Careful. Just kill it, fast. Hit it hard. Ah! That's all.
Gregoire: Be careful.
Sahaja Yogini: Yes, it is here.
But it's dead.
[Cut in the audio]

Gregoire: Mother, there, it's there. It's there. Mother, Mattias will be remembered in posterity for being the man who killed the hornet with a [unclear].
[Laughter]
Shri Mataji: Hornet? Hornet is the one that is the thick.
Gregoire: The thick one, and it can be deadly. Yes, it can be deadly.
Sahaja Yogini: Yes, if there are more than three or four, then it could be deadly.
Shri Mataji: But it's the same thick. It's the same thick you are telling now.
Gregoire: No, no, this is different.
Shri Mataji: You have all these things here?
Gregoire: First time I see it.
Sahaja Yogini: You know, I have already seen it, sitting on the balcony. There are a few around.
Shri Mataji: Now, why don't you do something more about it? [Unclear]. From where do they come?
Sahaja Yogini: They are in the trees. In the trees. I think.
Shri Mataji: There must be some sort of a nest. You must inform the authorities or someone.
They’ll do the cleaning up. You must inform local people.
Sahaja Yogini: When we had a nest much bigger in the garden, we asked the firemen to come and to kill them.

Gregoire: Normally, we have to ask the fireman. You have already seen this big thing?
Sahaja Yogini: This big thing? Not in the house. In the outside.
Shri Mataji: You must now close all the windows and you will not have a problem like that. You close the whole house properly, all right? And you get out from the house. At that time, the fireman may come and clear it. And you are free when they say, "It's all right". But they can tell you. Because the flies go out from here ...
Better tell them. If you have seen, [unclear].
Gregoire: And we don’t see such things now. I mean, the first time I see it, I mean...
Shri Mataji: I haven’t seen this kind in India. You have only wasps, but not like this.
Sahaja Yogini: Wasps, we had a lot of wasps just here.
Gregoire: Terrible. We could not stay on the balcony, impossibly. There was a nest just on the other side of the house.

Shri Mataji: I think that there are really too many trees also.
Gregoire: This place has many trees.
Shri Mataji: [Unclear]. You see, actually, I think you should have [unclear] in the places where there is less sun.

Who is this gentleman? You know?
Gregoire: It's a painting which has been done in Munich. It's not family. It's just a study of a character. And it is called - It's a warrior- it is called ‘Before the Enemy’. He sees the enemy which is attacking and he takes out his sword.

Shri Mataji: Who was he?
Gregoire: Mr. Wolf who was the [unclear] of München. I think he was the rector of the main art gallery in Munich.
Shri Mataji: When was that?
Gregoire: This? The beginning of the century.
Shri Mataji: Mr. Wolf. Okay. The expression is showing what he is thinking about.
Gregoire: Or defending himself.
Shri Mataji: And the beauty of the whole thing is that there are very few colours. When you have few colours, you see, there is no confusion, no complication. Because [unclear] is it's just very few colours which offer shapes of brown and orange. All right?

May God bless you. Thank you. So now, I think [unclear].

Sahaja Yogi: Italians and Swiss have the best flight on the 20th December. Shall we, can we take it or shall we forget about it and take a more expensive flight?
Shri Mataji: It’s all done.
Sahaja Yogi: Apologies. You already... Okay, yes...
Shri Mataji: It’s all right. We are going to be in Bombay from 18, at least 5 days.
So, first you have to pay [unclear] because if you book it, you book it for all of you. You see, you book it, all right?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.
Shri Mataji: When you arrive on the 21st, you see me in that place on our... and [unclear].

[Gregoire speaks in Italian to the Sahaja Yogis at 37 until 39:42]
[Gregoire speaks now in French: Dans la voiture, Mataji m’a dit ce qu’il faut faire. Elle m’a dit: 'Il faut inviter les gens chez toi etc...' Gregoire: 'Oui, oui. Je le fais toujours je l‘ai fait à Rome.' Shri Mataji: ‘Oui, il faudra avoir une relation intime, les inviter pour prendre le thé.’ Gregoire: ‘Oui, oui, je le fais. Il n’y a pas de problème.’ Puis, au bout d’un moment j’ai dit: 'Il y aura juste un petit problème. Mon point faible, c’est que Catherine attend un enfant et puis à un moment donné, elle ne pourra pas faire -'. Et là Mataji, vraiment, si tu veux, m’a enguirlandé. Elle m‘a dit, ma femme m’a dit: ‘J’ai ramassé quelque chose de toi, de Mathias’. Le genre de ‘concern’, de petit ‘concern’ for his wife’] [Gregoire speaks in English] The tears for his wife. I started having this because I talked to him at the beginning of the program. So, something came on to me. [Gregoire goes back to French: Et ce qu’elle a dit c’est que vous ne devez pas avoir des petites choses comme ça.40:41 ]

Count your blessings. If you stop counting your blessings, then... All those who understand French understand in English. So the rest can also be said in English..
Then Mataji said, "If you stop counting your blessings, then, and if you worry about trouble, then you invite trouble, and you will have trouble." And then she said, "So many people, so many wives are giving birth to their children, what is so great about it?" If you can, she can even have birth here", showing the street.
And I said, "Oh, Mother, please". I mean, you know, it was really kind of- She was really unpleased by this reaction. I said something I should not have said.
Arnaud: It's a teaching for all of us.
Gregoire: What happened actually, what happened is I told you that I had no fear that I can handle Vienna, right? So, I had no problem. Why did I tell her in the car, this thing, that the only weak spot was this, that [that Gregoire’s wife was pregnant and that he could not give programs] which was rubbish, you see. Now this is just to bring into her attention to something, it's just bringing something negative to her. That's why She said, "Oh, what he says here!".

Sahaja Yogini: Can you say here, what Mother said that we had to promise and so on? [Another Sahaja Yogini explains that they did not understand and translates in Italian the beginning of Shri Mataji’s talk.]

[Gregoire speaks in Italian]
