Talk Language: English | Transcript (English) - In Progress

Sahaja Yogini: And nobody put a question, as they were thoughtless.
Shri Mataji: And I waited for ten minutes [unclear]. I tell you, because what was going on outside [unclear]
And that lady came back, the wife, I think.
Gregoire: Yes?
Shri Mataji: Yes, she came back.
Gregoire: With reddish hair?
Shri Mataji: Hum. She went out and came back. I saw her coming back. She must be annoyed; she must have blasted you.
Sahaja Yogi: She was annoyed, when she got up, [unclear], she was unhappy about it.

Sahaja Yogini: And during your voice speech vibrations were so fresh, so fresh, all the time.
Shri Mataji: I know, they are really too much. But just for now [unclear].
A very good speech, very compact and very timely, very timely. I touched Sahasrara also, quite a lot. But mainly, the soul [unsure].

Gregoire: You were- the whole time, because I was on the stage, I could see the faces. And it quite amazed me, Mother, that I seldom could see, in such a crowd, an amount of people who were so respectful and eager to receive something. I was just amazed.
Shri Mataji: Did they clap for your lecture? Just imagine, they did not clap for Me.
This is for you, the clap, [unclear].
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, I heard it.
Shri Mataji: Really sweet of them.
Gregoire: They were sweet. As I talked to the people in the car, I was really touched, because I mean, generally is not that response.
Shri Mataji: They were very much touched by your lecture, you know? For a young man, to speak on that, they were surprised.
Gregoire: You didn’t know that we did an introduction?
Sahaja Yogi: I didn't have any room.

Shri Mataji: No one never clapped, you see, in any case, when there is an introduction. This is the first time, I was very happy, so I also clapped. So I didn't understand what I was doing.
[Laughter]

Shri Mataji: So, one thing I want you to tell you, that when Sahaja Yogis, you see, react or do anything wrong, it really, my body is harmed, actually, and believe Me, it gives such [unclear]. But if anybody else does anything, nothing can touch Me. But you, because you are part and parcel of Me, anything you do, anything, that harms Me, in a way. So now remember, for all of you, that don't try to do any negative things before Me. If you have, you go, cleanse yourself, come back. But don't tell Me any negative thought anymore, all right? If you have a problem, raise your hands. All right. Never any negative things will be close to Mother.

And nothing negative, I cannot do that. You do it, all right. But it's coming through, it's not [unclear] Because you are part and parcel of Me. My eyes start spinning [unsure] for that people. You are my eyes, you are my heart, you are my everything.

[Unclear] it doesn’t matter. I just laugh. But for you, you must remember that I have given you a place in my body, in my being, in my heart. The slightest movement if you make against the rhythm of my body, it possesses you. You should never trouble Me anymore.
