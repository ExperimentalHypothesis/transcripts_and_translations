Shri Mataji: Emma.
Now, who has come from north of France?
Sahaja Yogi: From Rouen, there is a group.

Shri Mataji: I spent the time to shake hands.
This time I could shake hands.
Shaking hands is good after Realization.
[Laughter]
Not before that.

Sahaja Yogi: Et les autres de Rouen? Les autres Sahaja Yogis de Rouen? [What about the Sahaja Yogis from Rouen?]
They have not arrived.

Let's see all of them.
Not those I know but new ones.

Sahaja Yogi: José.

Shri Mataji: What's her name?
Sahaja Yogini: Dominique.
Shri Mataji: Dominique.

I saw someone standing.

Is he there?

Sahaja Yogini:  They have already met you at a puja in London. Both of them.
Shri Mataji: Let Me see [inaudible]

Sahaja Yogini: They came to a puja.
Shri Mataji: Yes, yes, yes.
What's her name?
Girl: Ginette.
Shri Mataji: Ginette.

Hello Nathalie.
I'm happy Robert could come.
His exams are over.
Sahaja Yogi: No Mother.
Shri Mataji: Not yet?
Sahaja Yogi: Tomorrow I have one.
Shri Mataji: Then you have to go.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.
Shri Mataji: Oh, then you're not for the puja.
Sahaja Yogi: I have to leave at seven twenty, I have a train.
Together with Gaston.
Gaston.
There's Gaston. He is also a Belgium Sahaja Yogi.

Shri Mataji: Is he?
Sahaja Yogi: Gaston.

Shri Mataji: That's all I've been asking.
What's his name?
Sahaja Yogi: Gaston.
Shri Mataji: Gaston.
Sahaja Yogi: Gaston.
Shri Mataji: Gaston.

So, he's also going with you?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes Mother.
Shri Mataji: Both of you. Oh, I see.

There is a girl, you see,  called Valérie, in London. She's trying to make a picture [inaudible] guru suffering, you see, how people have suffered. And for a [inaudible], I said best is Robert to talk about the thing. Just one fellow woman, and we talked about it.
So she- I said after his exams he comes to London and meet her. Or she should come to Rouen; which way?
Sahaja Yogi: I will come to the Guru puja, Mother.
Shri Mataji: Oh, then she can do it, better, yes, Guru puja.
So you all know that Guru puja is on the 24?
Have you received the complete thing?
Sahaja Yogini: No.
Shri Mataji: Have you shown them, the new people?
Have you shown Robert and all these people about the puja?
Marie: No. I did even know, Mother.

Sahaja Yogi: Mother, I got a letter from Gregoire and he said it's the 28.
Shri Mataji: 24. Nobody has sent any letters here?
Sahaja Yogi: No, we've received one letter from Gregoire and there is - in the letter, it was one week later from the real date. So we have changed you know now, and we are translating it in French and we'll give it to everybody so they will know that there is Guru puja.
Shri Mataji: All the, all the details about it.
Sahaja Yogi: Only one paper, only one letter.
Shri Mataji: Macha?
Sahaja Yogini: Mother, they are been sent out of London I was just watching it and they were still being put on. So they'll be coming soon to the other centres.
Sahaja Yogi: Oh, I see.

[inaudible]

.
There're some more packages here for information.

Shri Mataji: Yes, yes.
Sahaja Yogini: It's complete and being sent.

Shri Mataji: Now, luckily, you see, they got a nice place.
And of different prices level. So it will suit everyone.
Some people can stay in the rooms, some can stay in the tents, then they have large rooms. Like that, it will suit everyone and it's quite something out of taste, you see, it's quite good.
And it is away from London. I don't know how many miles. I could get wrong [inaudible], one hour's traveling and also from Brighton it is about half an hour journey, something. It's a triangle. And something, it's quite good they said. Luckily they got it when I was there. And they are very helpful, they are very nice and they are willing to give you nice food. But they have decided to have their own food, [inaudible] also, for two days.
Jessun [name unsure] is doing it and you know Jessun is very methodic.
He's doing it very well and he'll make you very comfortable.

Shri Mataji [to a baby]: Look at that now!

Shri Mataji: He's showing noses of everyone. See!

[Laughter]
You see, you used to do the same when you were a baby.
Did you do that?
To show noses like this.
Right?

Shri Mataji [to a baby]: Just look at that now.

The younger ones are interested in animals, you see.

Now he's txo years, better.

Shri Mataji: What are your exams now Robert?
Robert: Pardon, Mother?
Shri Mataji: What are your exams?
What are you doing? Lots of things?
Sahaja Yogi: What subject do you take?
Robert: I have to study by heart all the buildings of Europe.
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Robert: All the architecture of Europe.
Shri Mataji: Ah?
Robert: From fourteen hundred till seventeen hundred.
Shri Mataji: It's interesting!

[Laughter]

Marie: No, that's mind.
Shri Mataji: No, it's not mind. I tell you, it's not mind. Because you had the styles, you know, repeated for years. The same style, more after [inaudible] all over the world you've been [inaudible]
Like in India, it's very different because they are spontaneous people. They have not formed any styles. So, they cannot make it into a form or a style, or you cannot say this period was a - there is little variation in everything. It's rather intricate.

Robert: I've also a course about Indian art, actually.
Shri Mataji: You have
Robert: But it's to study their architects
Shri Mataji: Hum?
What is that you have in Indian architecture?
Robert: Tressano.
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Robert: Trefandro, no?
Shri Mataji: What did you say?
Robert: I didn't study it yet, Mother.
Shri Mataji: But, you see, we have, I mean, I don't know how you will be studying it, but we had only, to begin with, we got these Greek people coming in India, you see? And they started teaching people how to – They knew only how to hew rocks and make big, big temples and all that.
And then, these people came and started teaching us how to make houses of big, large, it's like palaces. We had palaces before also. But they taught us but the best part of it, they taught us how to the rock also. And in that they wanted Buddha to look like a Greek, you see. So, they gave him mustaches and also gave him shoes, you see. And the nose of Buddha is just like a Greek nose, you know, starting from here, straight down here, like that. Not like an Indian one. And Buddha sitting with his shoes on, imagine, with a mustache.
[Laughter]
And wearing the same type of a dress, you know that Greek cloth without any stitching, what people call that?
Sahaja Yogini: A toge.

Shri Mataji: Ah. And the hairs' style, we call it "linger shinary" in Sanskrit. And the same type of hairstyle that they wore at that time. They gave it to him, Buddha.
But they had rapports from India long, long time, thousands of years back.

Because, when I asked them: "Are you ready to call this bona saker?" They said: "We had a rapport from India for long, long time. Say, they said about six, seven thousands years back.
And I think it questions the time when Rama's children, both of them, Lav and Kush, went to- one went to China, and another went to the slave country.
The "swent" word comes from "se-ga". Lav was one of the eight Lankavatara "Kashapas"
to slave. "Se" means with
Lav was one
one of the

So that's why the Chineses are called as Kushan. They are called as Kushan. Because he was Kush, imagine! And this must be thousands of years back.
Because, when I asked them: "Are you ready to call this this bona saker?" They said: "We had a rapport from India for long, long time. Say, they said about six, seven thousands years back.
And I think it questions the time when Rama's children, both of them, Lav and Kush, went to- one went to China, and another went to the slave country.
The "slave" word comes from "se-ga". Lav was one of the name for a lamasya [unsure].
The Slave.  "Se" means "with","Lav".
"Lav" was one day, one of the "Kashapas" [unsure]
And that was the source.

So that's why the Chineses are called as Kushan. They are called as Kushan. Because he was Kush, imagine! And this must be thousands of years back. And that was the source. Even now, they say [inaudible]. It's close, there is a temple of Indulika [?] Devi, one of the Goddesses there.
Shilde [unsure].
It's very interesting this thing.

Alexander came much later.

Shri Mataji: [about a baby] He's happy with it.
They are all the same as children.

Give it to Barbara.

A little one. Thank you.
There's a fragrance actually.

They are all now going to America, Sahaja Yogis. Those who are asking to go, or would like to go.
Some are going to Canada and some are going to Europe, some are going to [?] some to Los Angeles and some to San Francisco. We are all trying to see that they are there, just to two of them work out. Let's see what happens.

Marie: Mother, we were wondering whether it would be good, as well as Alexander, to go.
Shri Mataji: That would be a very good idea.
Sahaja Yogi: [inaudible]
Shri Mataji: Very good idea, very good idea. You see, actually, we need people to help, no doubt.
You see, postering and all that has to be done, apart from that, there's, I don't know. Just, I'm thinking of [inaudible] one broadcasting from, I saw TV and everything, from this place, what you call, Los Angeles. Then, once it is done, then they say: "that thing will work out." If that happens, it will be better that we can really manage it, [inaudible] something. Because newspaper's people are extremely difficult - newspapers, in New York especially. They have very funny ideas.

Sahaja Yogi: Mother?
Shri Mataji: Hum.
Sahaja Yogi: Will it be possible to stay in some Sahaja Yogi's house if we go there?
Shri Mataji: Yes, I think so, you can arrange.
We should. We should be able to. They are all working but we don't have so many. Actually, there is another thing working out by Indians, you see, Modi is going. He's going to take one house and hire it.
Sahaja Yogi: And which town would you prefer us to go, Mother? Which part of America you would prefer us to go?
Shri Mataji: Anywhere, I mean, anywhere. But, because New York is the worst of all, so it needs more people-
Sahaja Yogi: So New York.
Marie: Catherine settled here.
Shri Mataji: She's so fed up now. In one of her letter she writes: "if you come to me, and then we just tell them a little thing that they hear all truth, they get angry. You tell them anything, you see, they have preconceived ideas, they'll say: "No, no, you can't get Realization like that, How do you say?" All this, they have so much over-read and there have so many people in their heads, that it's impossible."
Sahaja Yogi: We have a good experience of that in Paris already, Mother.
Sahaja Yogini: Right.
Shri Mataji: Is it?
She said they are very clever.
Marie: [Inaudible]
Shri Mataji: She said they are not yet exposed to the truth at all.
For them it's like shopping, there are going from one place to another like that.
But, in other places it has worked, you see, so it should work in America also. We have to approve the right type of people, that I don’t know what to do. But once there is a good broadcast, I think, people will start thinking about it. If they hear Me, they’ll start thinking about it.

I gave him some nice- did you write down what I said?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes Mother.
Yes
Shri Mataji: Can you do that?
Sahaja Yogi: I don’t have it with me, Mother.
Shri Mataji: No, no.
You should arrange something for people to go there. Aunty Christine has a house then that Herman has a house. [inaudible] has houses. And also you can take a house and hire it. As Modi is going, he is taking a house on rent.
Modi is a very dynamic person, no doubt. But, how far he will be successful in America? You can’t say.
But his presence there might help a lot, I think.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes Mother.
Marie: It will help the Sahaja Yogis to keep Spirit-self. Definitely.
Shri Mataji: Yes, definitely.
Apart from that, you see, there are a lot of Gujaratis and he thinks that he can bring them round. How many Indians there are, I don’t know. But he thinks so, that he might be able to speak to them and bring them round.

But lots of false gurus have left there,  [inaudible] they have now gone to Los Angeles. So the people are carrying on with this. Those gurus are dead now, they are lost in- they are no more in Los Angeles, but these people are still having their [inaudible].
They can't forget these gurus.
You see, for them, now it has just become prestigious. What to do? So forget a guru means a prestigious thing.

Dany went there, I mean, they are all, Macha, Dany, then Christine, her husband, now working in New York.
Last time, we did a lot; working as much as possible.
But nobody used. You see, when I go there, definitely people come, no doubt.  Even in New York, we had a lot of  Even in New York, we had a lot of them, sometimes about [inaudible], sometimes unveiled, to two hundred [inaudible]
Rosenwald, there were five hundred, six hundred people, but they think it's a lot as they were telling Me.

[To a baby]: Hello! Yes, yes!
Sahaja Yogini: Mother, some people have arrived from France, Christine.
Shri Mataji: Hello!
Another Sahaja Yogini: From Mulhouse.
Sahaja Yogini: From Mulhouse and some other girls.
Shri Mataji: I think the old people should go out and let the new people come in.
Marie: All right, Mother.
Sahaja Yogi: Mother, elder children from Paris?
Marie: Mother, you remember Jean-Yves?
Shri Mataji:  Yes, yes.
Shri Mataji: So the new people seem to be much more solid.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Mother.

Shri Mataji: So how are you? Are you [inaudible] now?
And there's a lot of now sunshine in France. There's a lot of bright future for France.
French people are taking to a lot of sad solutions because they thought they had no solution. Because they did not know that there is something very great awaiting above minds. And they indulge into all these things very much. But they must know that God has created this world and that he’s going to look after you. He’s going to bless us. He’s going to give us all that is born of you and beautiful. The time has come. And it’s for you all now to decide that it is God’s work and how much you must dedicate [inaudible].
It’s going to work for your forefathers because there will be blessed as they have given you life and for your progenesis.

French language is small.
French language is very short.

So, now it is your responsibility, it is a very great responsibility. The world is standing at a very grave position because stupid people are using this world for a game and to play with it. And then to destroy it. So, it is for you to know what is false, what is real. And then you have to, after knowing it, you have to master the art. And then, you have to spread it to others. It’s only you who can make them masters. And I’m sure it will spread like fire. It’s for every place, every place, not only about France, it’s every place.

Robert seems to be very unhappy about Germans' case already. But even, it should happen just trust Me, I know. We are gathering forces in Germany too. You see, once the Germans take to Sahaja Yoga, then nobody can stop it.
[Laughter]
They have still some funny ideas which will drop out by themselves.
There are lots of Rajneesh disciples in Germany, lots.
And now, he is in a mess himself you see. He has to get out of America. He can’t talk. Because his voice is finished, he cannot talk. And they are trying to make out a case out of it. But he cannot talk. So, they say he is not teaching. A person who cannot talk, how can he be a teacher? So they have to- I mean they have decided to throw him out. And once he goes out in that way and he is absolutely exposed, then it might be that the people will turn right.
Of course, they can twist up many things by saying that he had been tortured and he is Christ crucified. Lots of things are working out. Like this new disease that has come now, AIDS, in America. I heard in England that ten thousands of people are suffering from that.

[Cut in the video]
But, just imagine, fifty years back, people were eating very [inaudible]  they probably suffered, but nobody had cancer, nobody knew about it. All kind of funny diseases, like when they give estrogen to a chicken. Those who eat that chicken you get puberty at a very young age, one year earlier.
And there's one boy, at 18 years of age, I saw him, he got breast and half body like man and half like woman. So this is so shocking. So by saying: "What's wrong. We can do what we like" all that is coming to an end now.

And Sahaja Yogis also should be very careful when they use all these medicines as far as- what you call- the chemical are concerned. [inaudible] Not very strong medicines.
Try to use simple things. You don't really need much because you are all Realized souls. If you know how to master art of Realization, you don't need so many drugs [unsure]. But, I mean, in case you're getting some troubles also or something chemical, be careful what you use. Even the toothpaste and all little things that if you use for day-to-day life, you have to be careful.
Actually, I'm trying to test may things just to see how it is reacting. So that you people don't suffer with the after effects.

And so we will send you a circular to all of you here to know what is to be used for soap, for this and that. And also, I'm very happy that I could meet all the new people over here.

Sahaja Yogini: Martine, Mother comes from Strasbourg.
Martine and that's her mother, Indu.
Sahaja Yogi: Philippe, from Rouen.
Patrick from Bordeaux.
Sylvie from Toulouse.
Shri Mataji: So the new people seem to be much more solid.
Sahaja Yogini: No, Mulhouse.
Sahaja Yogi: Sorry. Then Alain, from Mulhouse also.
She's taking care of them, Mother, Christine is taking care of them.
Jean-Pierre.
Bernadette.
Sahaja Yogini: Cécile.
Sahaja Yogi: Bernadette. Mulhouse also.

Shri Mataji: So nice to see you all here.
Sahaja Yogi: Some more.
Nicole.
Lausanne Mother.
And Joël, he has not come.

Shri Mataji: I would say that for those who have come for the first time should sit inside and the rest should go outside.

Now, the task [unsure] should be understood. When you'll become aware of it, you'll be surprised that God has given you all the powers. So, try to understand Sahaja Yoga in its essence first. And don't try to compete. Because you can't understand through your mental capacities.
So, one has to reach that state of awareness in which you really can understand and grasp it. It's something that is eternal. Because a new kind of a revolution is working on via Sahaja Yoga, which is the truth, actually. And the truth is such a great mirror that all that has happened so far in history can be seen clearly. You will know who was right, who was wrong, what perception was correct what was wrong. Everything you will know absolutely separately as two compartments.

So, if you- if somebody tells you: "This is not good for Sahaja Yoga", don't get upset. You have willpower because you are young. You can accept anything. If you accept something, you can practice it in no time. You are the leaders of the world.
And you can after [inaudible] you have to humbly understand that God has created this universe and he has given all his powers.
And that he's so All-pervading, that he looks after you at every point and every minute. As a story, you discover all these things. It's such a fantastic vision that amazes [inaudible].
There is one little thing, I'll tell you, that happened then you can't  [inaudible] it. I was in Bedford. Do they know the story of Bedford?

Sahaja Yogini: No, Mother.
Shri Mataji: I was giving a lecture, in front of 5 or 6 hundreds of people, in the town of Bedford.
And then, and a boy felt down, about, at least ten, fifteen miles away from that place. From a bridge, he felt down from a motorbike [unsure].
And he fainted.
So, people who saw him falling down, they sent for an ambulance.
So, they said: "How is it you're falling so low and you now talk? What's- how are you in that case? You're quite fine."
So he said: "Actually, I felt down and a lady in white, an Indian lady in white came down off her car which was white and she touched me all over the body and I got cured. Except, she left a little part down below, saying that: "You come to me then I 'll cure you."

And the doctors, everybody was so surprised and they published it in a newspaper.
And the second day, he has seen some of my photographs in the newspaper. He went into- to people, to police and said: "This is the lady who saved me." So the newspaper people telephoned to Gavin to find out about me. And then Gavin said that: "You can find out from all these people that at that time, and even after that time, Mother was giving a speech in a hall." Before and after. And they could not explain they don't know about it.
But see the result of that was that the parents got frightened about it. And the boy never came to see me. And the people who were there also got frightened.
[To a child] Frightened, just frightened.
And they, you see, this fright has deviated them from divine life. There's nothing to be frightened about it. Because if the doors of heaven are opening we should enter into it, we have been waiting for that. Why should we be afraid or hesitating? Better get in!
And God is saying:  "Aye! [Come in!]"
[Laughter]

So we have to enter it so that we enjoy, enjoy because this is what is promised, and it's given to you and it's very simple. Because God as not promised like politicians.
[Laughter]
He gives the true promises. And so, your duty now is to settle down. Especially in the West, there has been no idea about what spiritual life is. Even the Christ' life was organized too much and you know what has happened to him. So, it's a different area where we are working. But you are great, great people who are born here. Because you have to emancipate this ignorant world. So the responsibility is even much more. Indian Sahaja Yogis don't have so much responsibility. You, people, have the real responsibility and real task. And as your friends have done it, you can do it also. I'm always with you. Always. And I love you very much. Whatever you want, I'm very ready for giving anything that you ask. Just you have to think of it and I will be with you. All powers are for you and all the angels are with you. All the powers of God and all the angels are with you. You must have faith in yourself that all is going to work out.
May God bless you all.
Beautiful.
It's touching me a lot to see you after millions or years. [Unsure]
I've been waiting for you and you have been waiting for me.  It is such a meeting that you can just not communicate.
May God bless you all.
And I hope we have a very successful, very, very beautiful session in Paris. And a good puja on Saturday morning.
May God bless you.
