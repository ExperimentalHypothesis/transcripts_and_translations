There is a girl, you see,  called Valérie, in London. She's trying to make a [inaudible] guru suffering, you see,  how people have suffered. And for a [inaudible], I said best is Robert to talk about the thing. Just one fellow woman, and we talked about it.
So she- I said after his exams he comes to London and meet her. Or she should come to [inaudible] which way?

[inaudible].
There're some more packages here for informations.

Shri Mataji: Yes, yes.
Sahaja Yogini: It's complete and will be sent.

Shri Mataji: Now, luckily, you see, they got a nice place.
And of different prices. So it will suit everyone.
Some people can stay in rooms, some can say in the tents, then they have large rooms. Like that, it will suit everyone and it's quite something outof taste, you see, it's quite good.
8:29
And it is away from London. I don't know how many miles. I could get wrong [inaudible], one hour's traveling and also from Brighton it is about half an hour journey, something. It's a triangle. And something, it's quite good they said. Luckily they got it when I was there. And they are very helpful, they are very nice and they are willing to give you nice food. But they have decided to have their own food, [inaudible] also, for two days.
Yessa [unsure] is doing it and you know Yessa is very [inaudible]
He's doing it very well and he'll make you very comfortable.

Shri Mataji [to a baby]: Look at that now!

Shri Mataji: He's showing noses of everyone. See!

[Laughter]
You see, you used to do the same when you were a baby.
Did you do that?
To show noses like this.
Right?

Shri Mataji [to a baby]: Just look at that now.

The younger ones are interested in animals, you see.

Now he 'll pull your ears better.

Shri Mataji: What are your exams now Robert?
Robert:
Shri Mataji: What are your exams?
What are you [inaudible] lots of things?
Sahaja Yogi: What subject do you take?
Robert: I have to study by heart all the buildings of Europe.
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Robert: All the architecture of Europe.
Shri Mataji: Ah?
Robert: From fourteen hundred till seventeen hundred.
Shri Mataji: It's interesting!

[Laughter]

Sahaja Yogini: No.
Shri Mataji: No, it's not mind. I tell you, it's not mind. Because you read the styles, you know, repeated for years.

The same style[inaudible] school all over the world [inaudible]
Like in India [inaudible] you can.
They got their spontaneous people.
They have not formed any styles. So, they cannot make it into a from or a style, or you cannot say this period was a - there is little variation  in everything. It's rather intricate.

Robert: I've also a course about Indian art actually.
Shri Mataji: You have
Robert: But it's to study their architects
Shri Mataji: Hum?
What is that you have in Indian architecture?
Robert: Tressano.
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Robert: Trefandro, no?
Shri Mataji: What did you say?
Robert: I didn't study it yet.
Shri Mataji: But, you see, we have, I mean, I don't know how you will be studing it, but we had only, to begin with, we got these Greek people coming in India, you see? And they started teaching people how to – They knew only how to hew rocks and make big, big temples and all that.
And then, these people came and started teaching us how to make houses of big, large, it's like palaces. We had palaces before also. But they taught us but the best part of it, they taught us how to the rock also. And in that they wanted Buddha to look like a Greek, you see. So, they gave him mustaches and also gave him shoes, you see. And the nose of Buddha is just like a Greek nose, you know, starting from here, straight down here, like that. Not like an Indian one. And Buddha sitting with his shoes on, imagine, with a mustache.
[Laughter]
And wearing the same type of a dress, you know that Greek cloth without any stitching, what did you call that?
Sahaja Yogini: A toge.

Shri Mataji: Ah. And the hairs' style, we call it "linger shinary" in Sanskrit. And the same type of hairstyle that they wore at that time. They gave it to him, that Buddha.

By they had rapports from India long, long time, thousands of years back.

Because, when I asked them: "Are you ready to call this bona saker?" They said: "We had a rapport from India for long, long time. Say, they said about six, seven thousands years back.
And I think it questions the time when Rama's children, both of them, Lav and Kush, went to- one went to China, and another went to the slave country.
The "swent" word comes from "se-ga". Lav was one of the eight Lankavatara "Kashapas"
to slave. "Se" means with
Lav was one
one of the

So that's why the Chineses are called as Kushan. They are called as Kushan. Because he was Kush, imagine! And this must be thousands of years back.

The "slave" word comes from "se-ga".
Lav was one of the name for a lamasya.
Slave.
"Se" means "with"
"Lav" was one day, one of the "Kashapas"  [unsure]
And that was the source.

So that's why the Chineses are called as Kushan. They are called as Kushan. Because he was Kush, imagine! And this must be thousand years back. And that was the source. Even now, they say [inaudible]. It's close, there is a temple of Indulika (?) Devi, one of the Goddesses there.
Shilde  [unsure].
It's very interesting.

Alexander came much later.

Shri Mataji: [about a baby] He's happy with it.
They are the same children.

A little one. Thank you.
There's a fragrance actually.

They are all now going to America, Sahaja Yogis, those who are [?] they are all trying to go.
Some are going [?] and some are going [?]
some are going to [?] some to Los Angeles and some to San Francisco. We are all trying to see that they are there to  [?] the work out.
Let's see what happens.

Sahaja Yogini [Marie]: [inaudible]
Shri Mataji:That would be a very good idea.
Sahaja Yogi: [inaudible]
Shri Mataji:Very good idea, very good idea.
You see, actually,

You see, postering and all that has to be done, apart from that,

broadcasting from, I saw TV and everything, from this place, what you call [?]
Then, once it is done, then they say: "that thing will work out." If that happens, then it will be better
that we can really manage everything. [?] also.
Because newspaper's people are extremely difficult. Newspaper in New York especially. Very funny ideas.

Sahaja Yogi: Mother?
Shri Mataji: Hug.
Sahaja Yogi: Will it be possible to stay in some Sahaja Yogi's house if we go there?
Shri Mataji: Yes, I think so if you can arrange. We should. We should be able to. They are all working but we don't have so many. Actually, there is another thig working out  [?], you se, Modi is going. He's going to take one house and hire it.
Sahaja Yogi: And which town would you prefer us to do, Mother? Which part of America you would prefer us to go?
Shri Mataji:Anywhere, I mean, anywhere. But, because New York is the worst of all, so more people-
Sahaja Yogi: So New York.
Sahaja Yogini: Catherine settled here.
Shri Mataji: She's so fed up now. In one of her letter she writes: "if you come to me, and then we just tell them a little thing that they hear all truth, they get angry. You tell them anything, you see, they have preconceived ideas, they'll say: "No, no, you can't get Realization like that, How do you say?" All this, they have so much overread and there have so many people in their heads, that it's impossible."
Sahaja Yogi: We have a good experience of that in Paris already, Mother.
Sahaja Yogini: Right.
Shri Mataji: Is it?
She said they are very clever.
Sahaja Yogini: [Inaudible]
Shri Mataji: She said they are not yet exposed to truth at all.
