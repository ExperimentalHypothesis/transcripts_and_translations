[Inaudible]... But one thing, we must make it sure that those children who study there, they must pay for it, because, you see, what happens that it should just that the money be paid there, it's finished there. That money can be recovered and can be used for some other purpose. Otherwise, sometimes in Sahaja Yoga it happens that people just send their children and do not pay for it; then it would be very difficult. Because it's not much, but whatever is needed. Because that money must be recovered and we should be able to put another space also with that; so with one we can have another, like that we can cope. That's a very good idea for the...yes.

And you can also get get children of another place around, so the parents also know something about Sahaja Yoga there. Would be a good idea to make all the possible enquiries. Then from the same schools we can take children there when they're a little bit grown-up. I think we should get Ray. Ray is a very good organizer; he's running his school very well, in Australia, and the government people came and they praised him very much. The children - and he brought them up very well. They are, in a way, little strict with the children, and also quite kind. It's a very good balance I think.

The children are so sweet, very sweet; so well-dressed and so good. When I was coming they had tears in their eyes; it's so sweet they were. And they look after even the leaves of the trees, you see; they even care for the leaves of the trees. It's so sweet of them. Everything is so nice to see them working like that; so involved with doing that; their own school, that's their own teacher; there's everything. And I think the strictness is only towards some children who become a little misbehaved. Then they separate the children, keep them separately, and then if they improve then they put them back. That's a good idea. But they don't allow them to mix up with others.

This will go on increasing very fast if things work out. I'm sure it will really work very fast. Another idea of Mine was that there's land given to us for the education of the Western people who want to learn twenty-one arts in India (inaudible). And that will supplement for our Indian people in another place - very close by. That's another land for educating them how to do this lathe work, this work, that work. But will be based on Sahaja Yoga. I mean, this is just a sort of a side issue; but will be based on Sahaja Yoga, because all the art is possible if you can concentrate your mind.

You see, the mind is such a funny thing - human mind is - that supposing he wants to study, what he will do? He will find out an excuse when to study. Then: "This time is not all right." Then he'll postpone. Then he'll say: "All right, let me go and eat something." Then again postpone. Then he'll say: "All right, let me do that." Like that he'll be postponing; the mind will be postponing all the time, and he'll not do the job. You see; that's the mind. So now when the people - that means, you see, your mind is going all over; there's no concentration, and without concentration you cannot do art very well. So to get that concentration, what we have to do is to teach them how to concentrate; and concentration is only possible through Sahaja Yoga. So, first of all, we'll teach them how to concentrate, and then make them Sahaja Yogis. And with that concentration they will be able to do all this work very well; because, after a certain age, if you have to teach somebody an art, it's like making a horse out of a donkey; it's not easy. So best thing is to make them at least Realized souls so their hand starts moving better, and they do it.

So Sahaja Yoga has to come there; and we'll get people from all over the centers and all over the world for that, and they will all be chatting. We'll see their vibrations - if they can come in, and all that. That's how we'll have to put them. And they will have to learn any one of the twenty-one arts. First, of course, they'll jump for all the twenty-one. I know they can't do it. So, gradually they will learn that they can't do it, so they'll take two or three; whatever they want to do.

Because Indian art is not easy, you know. Indian music, if people want to learn, is sufficient; Indian dancing is sufficient. There's no need to learn three or four things in India. And if you know Indian music, you can know any music, because it's all permutations and combinations of the throat or through the nose. Everything you learn in that music; so you know the music after that. Same with dancing, don't you think so? Such a difficult thing, Indian dancing; you have to really work hard; I mean then you can't do anything else, you see.

Then you need not play football. I think this football must be stopped; it's very unrhythmic. That's the reason it happens; it doesn't go with the rhythm of God, I think. That's why the people get so mad. Can it not be stopped, this Soc? Cricket is sensible. In India people only see cricket; they love cricket. I mean, in India you can't get tickets; poor things, isn't it? We will tell you: "We are so fond of cricket." Why have soccer? It's a horrible new thing.

So that is our education part of it; and the art side of it, one more point I would like to say today, that we have acquired land for our agricultural development, on the basis of vibrations; and this Mr Hamid, Dr Hamid, who has been doing research, he now wants to do one more research - he has asked for that blessing - but when the acid rain falls on the forest it burns away.

In Germany it has happened the worst of all; the German thing. So I said: "All right, if you do it you might be successful, but not the Germans. They must pay for their sins." They must pay - horrible people. They can't get away with it. So the nature is showing. What can we do? But he might be successful; and then he should run away from there. If things are successful, then he should run away; because what's the use of being there? They cannot (inaudible). If they become Sahaja Yogis, well and good, but otherwise why should God bless such people who killed helpless people in the gas chamber? The whole thing is horrifying. Can't understand even this great man going down there like this. Supposing his parents were killed like this - he would have gone? No feelings - horrible race - they think no end of themselves. I have been to East Berlin Myself and I told C.P. that these people are really rakshasas, they are devilish people. Even now, you see, they do not want to accept it as something we have done wrong. They say: "It was a political mistake." Imagine. What was political in that? To think that you are a superior race and all that. It's a horrible thing they have done and they should never be allowed to do it again, under any circumstances. It's very bad; it's so helpless method, such a helpless style of doing things, you see, with children dying like that. I can't even see it, it's so terrible. So let them pay for it. But this fellow, Dr Hamid, who has done these experiments with our vibrations, he's going to come to India.

Now, the only thing was, they said that the canal is going to come up to our land, so we should wait for one year more; so that's why I have postponed; but that will work out also. Let him show the miracles on one plot of land about the forest. But in London I noticed also some forest; it's happening here also. But you must stop this too much of industrialization. For such a little country like this, so much of industrialization. And that's why people are without jobs. If some industries stop, and some hand-made things we start making, it would be better; people will have some jobs, you see; there will be some balance. But I saw some trees really burnt - topside - that means it's having an effect here also.

Always nature, you see, balances. Not only that but teaches you a lesson. You cannot play havoc with nature; you have to be sensible about it. The way we have tried to exploit it has gone too far in every way, and that's how one has to pay for it. Thank God under-developed countries are better off because they have no need to work. But now they're running the same race. I don't know what's going to happen to them, but they are running the same race. Australia is much better, I tell you, because there's not so much, so much of industries are not there. Canada is much better also. Raw material is going from Canada but Canada is much better.

So all these things are to be understood in the Light of Spirit; then only it goes into the minds of people. Say, you have a school and if you tell them all these things about the world problems, what are the Sahaja Yoga solutions for that, they will understand it better. This must be described; this must be told to them, that these are the problems. You cannot just solve them by some superficial methods. It has to come from within, to understand the implications of this kind of an imbalanced economy they have, imbalanced procedures they use; absolutely imbalanced. I think all our efforts, human efforts, we have their expressions in this manner, better, everything. All our theories of sociology, this, that; say, even take the system of political differences; everything can be very easily understood if you are a spiritual person. And all these confusions will be solved. But let us see how you people are helpers there.

Indians are not bothered; because they don't have these problems, they don't have. But if you see the whole world as a big problem itself, then you have to help because you people know these problems better than they know. They don't know what is ecological balance and all that. If you talk to an Indian, he'll say: "What is this nonsense?" They have never heard of such a thing.

Shri Mataji: (inaudible) 'and so what happened with your interview?

Yogi: Well, it was quite interesting, Mother. I think he really felt as though he'd had a good blasting and...

Shri Mataji: Really?

Yogi: Yes, and he said he couldn't understand how, when we met us, the Sahaja Yogi's - and we were all so congenial and so, sort of, sweet and kind and so on - and then he saw You, and You were telling everybody - you know. So it's a little delicate, how to handle that. So I had to explain, you know, how You were concerned, and that's why You were telling these various things off, because you were concerned that people would get destroyed unless people knew. In so many things said I feel....

Shri Mataji: He felt better with that?

Yogi: I think he felt a lot better towards the end, but his wife is very difficult. She was there....

Shri Mataji: You see, it is not any... I am not trying to please any political party or anything. It's a thing which concerns anyone who has sensitivity; one should have sensitivity about it. You see, if you want to be sweet and nice about it, it can't make you solve the problem.You have to just take it out; it's an operation; all right? You go and meet him again and talk to him. But today there was a miserable picture of this (inaudible) thing in the newpaper. I don't know if you saw it. And if you read the newspaper interview- Did you see that? Oh you must see; he's very miserable. I thought: 'who is this miserable fellow?' - so it was him. And the way he talks about everything, he is so funny that you cannot think he is anywhere near God. Very funny; you just read that interview, and you'll be shocked. So what does his wife say?

Yogi: Oh his wife was just horrible, (inaudible) all together.

Shri Mataji: You should just say that: 'You are not sensitive enough'; that's what you should say.

Yogi: She said that she could not see how this feeling of cool breeze could be the baptism of the Holy Spirit, and I said: 'Well, you don't know anything; you didn't even hold your hands out. You didn't feel it, so how do you know what it was or what it wasn't?' And that shut her up for a while.
Shri Mataji: You should say: 'You can cure, with this, cancer; otherwise how could you cure if it was not so?' And according to her, what is it?

Yogi: She didn't say, I mean, she had nothing positive to say at all really.

Shri Mataji: I mean, it's very easy to oppose everything, but why not show some results yourself? Like, any guru person, if he comes to you, you should say: 'What have you achieved yourself?' (inaudible).

Yogi: I think that he was much better really. I think he likes Sahaja Yogis, and he does know there is something special about it. He agreed that a big difference between us was Paul, and you know because I said that is the thing that divides us more than anything else, is that we feel Christianity, to a large extent, was built on Paul's theories and not on Christ and His word; and he, sort of, defended Paul a bit.

Shri Mataji: And that's what they have to do, because they are paid by him. If you take up a job like that, what is going to happen to him? It's all right, it will work out now they have (inaudible) of their own. You can see that. If you see this interview you'll know - miserable looking fellow, absolutely miserable. He's only sixty years of age, he looks like an old man of at least ninety years. Really; there's no joy on his face, nothing. So now, may I take your leave?
May God bless you.
I would like you to give Me some plans for making the hearts we are going to make for children; will be a good idea.
