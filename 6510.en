Public Program. Sofia (Bulgaria), 23 July 1992.

I bow to all the seekers of truth. At the very outset we have to know that truth is what it is. We cannot think about it, we cannot conceptualize it, but you have to experience it. This is the time specially for you to get that state in which you can feel the truth, the reality. These are the most confusing times and in these times only you will find the truth. But you have to be honestly seekers of truth, because it is for your benevolence and for the benevolence of the whole world. We have come up to a state... Sorry...We have come up to a state, which is a human but is not absolute, it's a relative awareness we have. We do not know what is truth, what is reality. We do not know why are we on this earth.

Every human being whatever country he may belong to is born with a faith within himself. This faith is in the Divinity or any such thing which is higher that is above human awareness. All of you have got this Divinity potentially and nothing can change it. It is only clouded because of conditionings. This faith is challenged. There are so many things that challenges the faith. First we go to religions. Then we find that one may follow any religion, they are capable of doing anything wrong, anything sinful. So the religion is also mental. Moreover the religion that we see or these religions, they are money oriented or Spirit oriented. And that is what makes us doubt those who started the religions. But all those incarnations, prophets, all of them were absolutely real. But from childhood we are bombarded by false ideas and we got lost.

For example we'll take the case of Christ. Christ was The Son of God but His followers fell into a trap. This Paul who was a bureaucrat and a very cruel man thought that this is a very good platform to use for his own fame and he got hold of the weakest disciple of Christ, Peter. While Christ has predicted that: "You'll be taken over by Satan". These two put together tried to harass other disciples. One of them ran away to India, Thomas. Mathews had to fight and John could not give his part of the story. There is simple thing to understand that how could Christ ask Peter to form his church? That is how they edited the Bible and put wrong ideas. I was Myself born in a Christian religion but I was shocked. I didn't know how this Paul was there and I asked My Father who was a Realized soul and he said: "He's a squatter".

The first wrong idea he started was that of original sin. How can it be original sin when He attended the wedding? How can marriage be an original sin? He attended the wedding that means, did He want to encourage the original sin? That means all those who got married have been committing original sins: Shri Rama, Shri Krishna, Mohammed [SAAB or SAHIB], Nanak [SAAB or SAHIB], Lao Tse; all of them got married, they were all sinners. On absolutely wrong premises. And then you should see the way the priests are. In Canada there's a very big book that has come out where priests were abusing small children, twelve to fourteen years of age. Christ has said: "You'll be calling Me Jesus, Jesus. I won't recognize you". These are the people who are just trying to make money.

Once I was in Honolulu and at about eleven o'clock we came back from the program and we started seeing the television and I've never seen such a blatant program. There was one evangelist standing with a hundred dollar note. And he was saying: "You must release these hundred dollars and then God will give you everything". He said that: "One lady had collected hundred dollars for her grocery and she released it to us and next day she got all the grocery in front of her house." Only Americans can believe such stories, I tell you. Even the Indian false gurus have given horrible stories, which now they have confessed. You shouldn't believe into what they say. Even the media is mischievous. Anybody who pays them money, they want to publish that. These people who are standing on falsehood are afraid of Sahaja Yoga. It is very sad that they don't understand their own benevolence. They have to understand that so far they have not achieved their salvation.

So what's the use of doing that thing again and again? Christ has said: "You are to be born again", but that does not mean that you put a certificate "we are born again" and think you are born again. In Sanskrit language a Realized soul, a born again soul is called as "dvijaha". This "dvija" means born again, twice, born twice. Also a bird is called as "dvijaha" because it is first born as an egg and then it becomes a bird. In the same way we are born as human beings and then we become a Realized soul, a evolved soul. But you cannot call an egg as a bird. Bird has its own powers. This divinity is within you this power is within you. You do not have to pay for it because you cannot pay for it. It's an evolutionary process, which is a living work. Why should you be identified with anything, which had done no good to you?

He has already told you about the subtle centers we have within ourselves. This is the tree of life described, but so many things in the Bible are ambiguous because there was very short time Christ lived. And I feel that many things that He must have said were edited by this Mr. Paul. He has clearly said: "Know thyself", clearly. Do we know ourselves? He has said: "Thou shall have not adulterous eyes." Do we have those innocent eyes? Then that means something more has to be done.

These religions are not at all Spirit oriented. They are making money all the time they are worried about money. And also they mesmerize people, I think. The another wrong thing is that you must [THIS or THUS] confess. This has made people suffer so much. One girl, little girl she goes to a government school, asked Me: "Do I commit any sins?" I said: "None". But she said that: "In the school they asked me to confess. What should I confess?" So we are still...we should understanding it, what Christ has said has not been achieved at all. We have to get to our salvation and that is very easy. It will take no time for you to get your Realization because you have the power. There's another thing which surprises Me, that they said there is the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost is a dove. How can you have Father and a Son and no Mother?

This Paul was a hater of women. And also for Christ's Mother he [SAID or SAYS]: "Woman", he never said Madonna, he never used the word Madonna for Her. And five generations of popes were discussing the sin of Mother Mary. Such unholy things to say. They questioned the Immaculate Conception. After all that is God Almighty. He can do anything, He's not a human being. Who runs your hearts? Look at these eyes, they are such a good camera and look at this brain, it's such a computer. Who has made these? It is God Almighty. We call Him Almighty but we don't understand that He can do anything.

Nowadays we have a new type of an atmosphere that has started in these modern times. In India we say this is Kali Yuga means these are the worst times for human beings. But before the age of truth comes, there is another in between age, which we call as Krita Yuga. So the All Pervading Power of God's Love becomes active within that time. It has become active and that is how you are going to get your Self Realization. These miraculous photographs you have seen, they are also the work of this Divine Power. So what is the truth? The truth is that you are not this body, mind and conditionings, ego but you are the pure Spirit. The another truth is that there is All Pervading Power of Divine Love. We see these beautiful flowers and we take them for granted. We do not even think this miracle, just imagine. Who does this living work? This All Pervading Power of Divine Love.

Patanjali has called this as Ritambhara PrAgnya. It is known by many names. Is the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost. So who is the Holy Ghost? Holy Ghost is the Primordial Mother. In the Bible She's called as the Holy Ghost or the Cool Breeze, which the disciples felt, but nothing more. But the Greeks call this Athena. Atha means primordial. That is how one has to understand that this Kundalini, this Power is the reflection of this Holy Ghost within us. And the Spirit is the reflection of God Almighty. First you have to have your Realization and then only you have to know what you are, about everything, that's all. It is all built in within you. Like in a seed it is built in to sprout and the Mother Earth it is built in that she can sprout. This happening when it takes place, all these centers get nourished. All world problems are due to human beings and all human problems are due to these chakras. If your chakras are put right, all your problems can be solved. So the first thing that happens to you that you get your physical, mental and your emotional being absolutely into balance.

People of cancer and many other incurable diseases had been cured of Sahaja Yoga, with Sahaja Yoga. There are three doctors in India who have got their MD in Sahaja Yoga where they cured incurable diseases. But media in India is very sensible and wise. They don't believe in scandals. So all the big newspapers and weeklies have written articles and articles about Sahaja Yoga and Indian people have taken to Sahaja Yoga very easily because we don't have intellectuals like Freud in India. Recently I was reading a book called "Fraudulent Freud". It is all hocus-pocus. I used to say this, for the last twenty-two years I've been saying and people didn't like it. Now there's a very well known doctor who has researched and he said there's no scientific basis for his theories, no scientific basis. What he says it has already got a very malignant effect on the culture and thought of the western mind and it cannot be repaired. I think he doesn't know about Sahaja Yoga.

In Sahaja Yoga with your ascent everything that is stupid, harmful, distractive just settles down. Overnight people have given up drugs, overnight they are leading a very moral life. Look at these people singing Indian songs, which are very difficult to sing, specially the English - such hard [TIMES or SNAG, NUG] - and they are so good. I can't imagine how these people have become so creative. So we should know the nature of the Spirit. Spirit is the universal being within us. So what happens to you that you become an universal being. In the light of the Spirit you see that all religions are branches of the same tree. They are the beautiful flowers on the same tree of life. But we have plucked the flowers and we are fighting: this is mine, this is mine with the dead flowers.

So because we believe in all the religions as Mahatma Gandhi did, fundamentalists don't like us, they want to fight us all the time. So be careful about them. Even they can purchase the media. We have to be very careful. Even same type of things, the early disciples of Christ had to suffer, because they had the real knowledge. They were called as Gnostics. The word gna comes from Sanskrit. That means pure knowledge. This pure knowledge is your own. You don't need a big degree or anything, because it is so innate. Just as you can see Me sitting here you can feel the truth, the All Pervading Power. But when the light of the Spirit comes into your attention it starts flowing on your nerves and you can feel, actualize, you feel the All Pervading Power. You don't have to go and ask somebody else, you yourself know and you can find out anything whether it is true or false with these cool vibrations you get. You don't have to believe into anything blind-folded, you just put your hands and ask a question: "Is there God?" and you start getting the cool breeze quite a lot. You ask a question: "Was Christ the Son of God?" Yes, you start getting the cool breeze in your hands.

But if you want to know about Hitler or Stalin you might get little burning, maybe blisters also. Even the children can tell. So you know the absolute truth. It is not relative. Everyone knows the same thing and knows for definite. So why will there be any fights, wars, anything? But the first thing that happens to you that you come into present. You live into future or into past but by this happening you come into present and there is no thought, complete silence, complete peace. This state is called as thoughtless awareness. In Sanskrit it is called as Nirvichara Samadhi. This can be easily attended and in this state only you grow, spiritually. Then the second state is where you become absolutely doubtless that is you become doubtless about yourself, doubtless about all this power. But it's not mental, it's a state. You can raise the Kundalini of others. One man can give Realization to thousands. You can cure people, you can solve so many problems, your own and others'. And you become dynamic, at the same time extremely compassionate.

When this attention becomes enlightened into your eyes you get those eyes that Christ has described, innocent eyes without greed and lust. And wherever you put your attention it acts, this attention acts. You become that powerful, you can control rain, you can control the atmosphere, but above all you become absolutely righteous, virtuous and no way egoist. It's such a satisfaction you derive from the Spirit. So you know the absolute truth, your attention becomes enlightened and thirdly you enter into the realm of joy. Joy is not duality like happiness and unhappiness. But is a state, again, that you become a witness of the whole drama and you enjoy yourself and enjoy others. The miseries are over. This has been promised that you are to enter into the Kingdom of God and this is the time when you are going to enter. You are so fortunate to be born at this time and I am so fortunate that you are born at this time, that there are so many seekers. William Blake has said - a great poet whom the English called as mad man. He has said: "The men of God will be born and they can make themselves divine and make others also divine."

This is not a sermon or a lecture, you have to just understand that this is your own power and it has to be just awakened. This is the actualization. People mislead because they want to make money out of it or they want to have power out of it. But if it is for your good, for your benevolence why not have it? And when it is your own, what is the harm? Tomorrow there is going to be the greatest age of enlightenment and you have to be just entered into that. In short I've tried to explain, because I'm here only for one day. I was [ENAMORED] the way you people from Bulgaria have taken to your seeking. You are very wise people, I must say. Also the people in Romania, they [UNCLEAR]. But not in America, they are absolutely stupid. They have too much money so they have taken to false gurus and to drugs, all destructive things. I'm so happy to be here and I promise next year I'll be here again. But one thing must understand that Sahaja Yoga is not an individual happening, is not that one person can sit at home and do Sahaja Yoga. Of course you have to meditate at home for a short time but you have to be collective because it's a collective happening. As you become part and parcel of the whole, as the whole body, you see if there's something wrong with one finger the whole body looks after it.

The whole world, wherever Sahaja Yogis are, are your brothers and sisters, they are your real brothers and sisters. Any problem they'll run up to. I must tell you when I first went to Russia twenty-five German Sahaja Yogis came rushing. I was surprised. I asked them: "Why have you all come here?". They had tears in their eyes and they said: "Mother don't You think it is our responsibility to rectify what our forefathers have done?". You will not believe these Germans have become the softest people you could think of. They are so compassionate, so loving. Just imagine a stone has become like a flower, like a lotus, which is fragrant. That's what it is, they are all so beautiful within and you all have to get it. You have to have little patience with yourself, that's all.

So I think we can have now the meditation. It is for ten, fifteen minutes more and you can enter into the Kingdom of God. Those who do not want to have their Self Realization should leave the hall because we cannot force it. We respect the freedom of human beings. You have to ask for it, ask for pure knowledge and ask for Self Realization. There are three conditions, which are very simple. The first one is that you all have to have complete confidence in yourself that today you are going to get your Self Realization. Secondly you have to have full understanding that this All Pervading Power is the Ocean of Forgiveness. And whatever mistakes you might have committed can be easily dissolved by the Ocean of Forgiveness. So please forgive yourself, forget your past and know that you are no more a sinner. Have full faith in yourself. In short, you have to be placed very pleasantly towards yourself. Thirdly you have to forgive everyone without thinking about them. You may say that is difficult but logically if you forgive or don't forgive you don't do anything. But if you don't forgive then you play into wrong hands. Those who have troubled you are very happy while you are the one who's suffering.

Moreover the center, which is formed by the optic chiasm, is like this, very, very constricted. This center can only open like this if you forgive everyone. Otherwise you will miss because Kundalini won't rise. So please forgive everyone without thinking about them because it's a headache to think of them. I hope you will forgive, you'll feel much lighter. These are the only three conditions. I would request people sitting on the chairs can remove their shoes and also those who are sitting on the ground please remove your chairs. Because this Mother Earth helps us a lot, She sucks in our problems. Those who are sitting on the ground are all right but those who are sitting on the chairs have to put their both the feet on both the sides because there are two powers, left and right. The left power is the power of ordinary human desire and the right is the power of action. But the Kundalini, which is your Mother, individual Mother, is the power of pure desire. So please have the pure desire in your heart that you should get your Realization. So now you have to put your left hand towards Me like this, which is very symbolic that you want your Self Realization and with the right hand you have to nourish your centers on the left hand side. This only you have to do today, not all the time. So before you close your eyes we'll tell you how you will nourish your centers.

So please put you left hand towards Me like that, comfortably and put your right hand on your heart. Everybody should do it. Those who don't want to do it should go away and not watch other people, it's not very civil. If you don't do it you will not get your Self Realization and why miss it? For what? When you are entitled. Please sit down, please be seated. Better sit down, be comfortable. In the heart resides the Spirit. If you are the Spirit then you are your guide, your own master. So take your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. This is the center for your mastery. This is created by great prophets within you. Now take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen, on the left hand side. This is the center of pure knowledge, the divine knowledge. Take back your hand again on the upper portion of your abdomen, then on your heart. Now in the corner of your neck and your shoulder and turn your head to your right. This is the center you catch when you feel guilty. But with this you get diseases like angina, spondylitis and lethargic organs.

Then you have to take your right hand and put it across on your forehead like this and now please put down your head. This is the center where you have to forgive others. Take back this right hand now to the backside of your head and push back your head as far as possible. Here without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, for your satisfaction you have to ask forgiveness from the Divine Power. Now the last center is important. Stretch your palm fully and put the center of your palm just on top of the fontanel bone area, which was the soft bone. Now push back your fingers and put down your head. This you have to move round your scalp, pressurizing, scalp, seven times clock-wise. Push back your fingers, push back... Seven times. Please do it otherwise you won't get your Realization. You see, if you make fun, you'll be left behind. If you have come here to make fun you better go away. Stupid people cannot get Sahaja Yoga, anything. That's it. Now that's all we have to do. These two ladies should be asked to go because they are all the time troubling. They have no brains, I think.

Now, please put your left hand towards Me like this and have your self esteem that you are all going to get your Realization. Please put your right hand on your heart. Here you have to ask a very fundamental question about yourself. You may call Me Mother or you can call Me Shri Mataji. Please [UNCLEAR] put your both feet away from each other, those who are sitting on the chairs. You can take out your spectacles because you'll have to close your eyes and please don't open them till I tell you.

Now, the first question is: "Mother am I the Spirit?" Please close your eyes now and ask a question: "Mother am I the Spirit?", three times. If you are the Spirit, you are your master. So now please take down your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen, on the left hand side and press it hard. Here you have to ask another fundamental question, three times "Mother...." Please keep your eyes shut. Here ask a question again three times: "Mother am I my own master?" I've already told you that I respect your freedom and the pure knowledge, the divine knowledge cannot be forced on you. So now take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen. Here you have to say six times because this center has got six petals: "Mother please give me pure knowledge." Now raise your right hand again on to the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. As soon as you ask for pure knowledge the Kundalini has started rising. So you have to now nourish your upper centers with your self-confidence. At this point you have to say ten times with full confidence: "Mother I am my own master". Now, raise ten times left side, ten times.

I've already told you that you are not this body, this mind, these conditionings and ego but you are pure Spirit. So now raise your right hand on your heart and here you have to say with full confidence, twelve times: "Mother I am the pure Spirit". This All Pervading Power is the Ocean of Knowledge, Ocean of Compassion and Ocean of Joy but above all it is the Ocean of Forgiveness and you cannot commit any mistake, which cannot be dissolved by the Power of this Ocean of Forgiveness. So now raise your right hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder and turn your head to your right. Here, with full confidence you have to say sixteen times: "Mother I'm not guilty at all". I've already told you that if you do not forgive your Agnya chakra won't open out and logically it makes no difference whether you forgive or don't forgive. But if you don't forgive then you play into wrong hands. So now raise your right hand on top of your forehead across and put down your head, fully. Here you have to say from your heart, not how many times: "Mother, I forgive everyone in general." You do not have to think of them at all, just say it from your heart: "Mother I forgive them fully".

Now take back your hand, back side of your head and push back your head as far as possible. Here you have to say, again from your heart, not how many times: "Oh, Divine Power, if I have done any mistake, knowingly or unknowingly, please forgive me". Please do not count your mistakes. Now just stretch your palm nicely, put your right hand on top of your head and push back your fingers. Please put down your head. Now please push back your fingers, very important. And now move your scalp seven times, but you have to know one thing that I cannot force Self Realization on you. You have to ask for it, you have to ask for it. So now move your scalp seven times, saying: "Mother please give me Self Realization". Press it hard.

Now please take down your hands. Please put both your hands towards Me like this. Now don't think, you can do it. Please don't think. Now put the right hand like this towards Me, bend your heads and see with your left hand if you are feeling the cool breeze out of your fontanel bone area. It could be also hot, hot breeze if you have not forgiven, but you can feel it. Now please put your left hand towards Me and bend your head and see. [UNCLEAR] Some people get it far, some people get it nearer. Then again put your right hand towards Me and see with left hand if there's a cool breeze or a hot air. Now please put both the hands towards the sky like this and push back your head and now ask a question, anyone of these questions three times: "Mother is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost? or "Mother is this the All Pervading Power of God's Love?" or "Mother is this the Paramachaitanya?" Please ask three times from your heart anyone of these questions. Now please bring it down, put your hands [UNCLEAR]. You'll fell very peaceful and pleased. Don't think about it. It's beyond mental, it is beyond mental.

All those who have felt cool breeze or hot breeze in their hands, fingers or out of their fontanel bone area please raise your both the hands. Again, loudly. Oh, the whole of Bulgaria! I bow to all of you. Your saintly life has started. Have respect for yourself and for your Self Realization. Please, remember that you have to come to the collective to grow. You don't have to pay for it. In your own right you have got your Realization. So please respect it and grow. Your problems will be solved like miracles. May God bless you! (That's all right. Everyone got it. They are all in silence.) Next year again I'll be here. We have to just know what we are now and you'll enjoy your own glory and your own beauty. Now to protect yourself only you put your left hand like this and move your right hand like this, every morning like this, three times. Just to protect, from negative forces. And now enjoy yourself.
