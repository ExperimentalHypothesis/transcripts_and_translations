Letter on Guru Purnima. 1 July 1977.

My dear Children Sahaj Yogis,

          I am happy to learn you are celebrating Guru Purnima on
1st July.
          It is very hard to be a Mother and a Guru. Mother is the
Guru of Gurus. Mother has to be a Guru to her children but She does
not perform this duty the way the Guru does. She reduces the distance
between Her desciples and Herself by treating them as Her children
her own part and parcel. But, Oh! my children, you are really born
out of my Sahastrara. I conceived you in my heart and gave you the
new birth through the Brahmarandhra. The Ganges of my love has
carried you into the realm of collective consciousness.
          This love of mine is too great for my human body. It
nourishes you, soothes you and gives you security. Gradually it opens
your awarness to bliss and joy. But this love also corrects you and
prunes you. It guides you and directs you. It reveals itself in the
form of true knowledge. It absorbs your shocks and settles you like a
gliding leaf on the hard surface of truth. It strengthens you to
fulfill your aspirations of reaching spiritual heights.
          After all what is the Guru principle? It is that aspect of
this Divine Love that guides and warns, which gives you the dos and
don'ts. Because if human beings fail, they become Rakshasa and
Danavas, which is a fact.
          All your ancient scriptures are singing praise of the
incarnations as Gurus. Dattatreya, the three fold innocence that
guides the path of Dharma. There are ten basic Dharmas of human
beings. They must be guarded, respected and are to be identified with
tadatmya.
          There is no compromise but human intelligence gives ideas
by which human societies have gone into horrible conditions. They
play of mind takes us to sin and we become insensitive to sin.
          Today I want you to resolve that you all will become
ABSOLUTELY Dharmic. It is hard to be a Dharmic. The society and the
environment forces you to be Adharmic. You are born in innocence and
later you go on compromising and accepting Adharmic patterns as
normal.
          For a Sahaj Yogi, it is difficult to be Adharmic. If he
tries to do a wrong thing, he is corrected by the vibrations. Butif
you go on killing your awakened conscience you are free to do so and
kill all your chances of ascent.
          One aspect I would emphasises this time. "Do not comit
Adultry" ................. Christ went further to say that, "You
should not have a adultrous heart or mind because you are self
realised. Your behaviour pattern moves from inward to outside.
Introspect yourself. Do not confuse your lust with 'Love'. I have
heard prostitutes singing the love song of separation.
          They are the ones who creat the agony of separation for a
Gruhalaxmi and act as the oppressed. Be careful you are not acting
and playing the games of Adultry. The sind becomes subtler and
subtler with sophistication.
          Respect your marrriage institution. Women have to be
Gruhalaxmis. Firstly she has to be dedicated and completely fidel.
Secondly she is to be worshipped like a Gruhalaxmi. This is the
double meaning of yatr naryestu pujete. The word pujete 
means the one who is worshipable and is also worshipped.
          In Sahaj Yoga you have to forget the past as you have been
bathed with Divine Love, like a newly born baby. Purity of heart
expressed as fidality in marriage for both husband & wife is the most
enjoyable virtue and is the most powerful. When you understand the
purity of relationsship, you enjoy them the most. You do not confuse
your sensitivity to joy. Your mother is a mother and wife is a wife.
Here in the West,  it is all becoming a confusion. Very young girl
are marrying old men and vice versa. It is all the game of money. If
you have too much then stupidity becomes the pattern of the
society. They become so blind that they call it Love.
          This stupidity is very very dangerous. Beware of it. Steady
your attention by keeping your eyes on the Mother Earth. Thus you get
the loving bandhan of your Nani and you become free of enslavement
to your lust.
          May be some of the marriages are not alright but exceptions
should not create a mass disturbance. They should suffer it for the
masses. Once the citadel of virtue starts tumbling down, the whole
building of Sahaj Yogis will tipple down, and who can suffer, but
this mind which does not touch you who is a witness. Enjoy the
tragedy of your life as a witness and think of what image you create
for others to follow. Realise what is the role of a sahaj yogi in
this disturbed self-destroying world? Thus arise into new role.
          There are other 'Dharmas', all very important, meditate on
them. I find my love reflected in your shining dharmic eyes.
          With all my blessings to you all,
          Yours as ever always remembering your all

                              Your Mother
