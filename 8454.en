1978-01-31 Advice in Delhi, Part 1 - Rajoguna and Swadisthana Chakra - Lakshmipati, Delhi

I have told you about Nabhi Chakra and also about void. The guru principle resides in this “bhavsagra” (void) and this guru principle establishes the dharma within us. These ten petals here that we have shown are the ones which establishes the ten dharmas within us.  (Shri Mataji points towards the petals on the chart). It is important to have these ten dharmas in a human being otherwise he is not a human being. Even if he has has nine dharmas in him is still (Inaudible text) a bit and if he does not follow these dharmas that are within him, and when I say dharma I don’t mean by Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, and all that but dharma means the innate dharma of humanity within if one does not keep to those ten dharmas then he turns into a demon/devil. This guru tatwa/principle has taken birth in this world in many forms especially it has these ten main incarnations have taken birth like Raja Janaka, Nanak, Mohamad saa’b etc.and at the end it was Sai Nath from Shirdi, who took birth. They tie this tatwa/moral within us because all these gurus who have taken birth for our evolution are placed within us. 
(1 sentence- unclear text) these gurus are very subtley placed deities within us. 
Like for these guru already say “don’t consume alcohol”, then they weren’t mad that they said this. Neither they were standing in any elections to win votes that they said that. You can’t even say that they had any kind of business that in some competitive feeling he said that thing. 
They said “child, don’t drink alcohol, don’t take to cigarettes, don’t take any kind of drugs” because the position of our attention within is also placed in the area of void. 
You will be surprised to know that our attention is in our stomach. Actually, to be specific, in liver resides our attention. They said you don’t drink alcohol so your attention does not get spoiled. You know by drinking human awareness gets damaged. People got the other way by saying ok, if drinking is not allowed then lets not garlic, onions, etc. Prophet Mohamad  used to eat garlic, onions and also Nanaka used to eat meat and all that * attention should not be wasted on food etc. what we would in the morning, what we would eat in dinner, what you will eat today, what will you eat tomorrow and so on...I went to Paris, I was shocked to see how (text1- glutton/*) much time people spend on the thought of what would you eat. An hour before they will make you sit down and there will be a discussion on what will you eat, they will bring you a menu then people will decide “okay I will eat this, I will eat that”..and on top of it there will be an intensity about their deep interest in that particular dish. Does everyone has the same taste or what? They will make you work hard in this one hour and after this discussion now they will keep drinking wine. AFter that, God knows what they like...Then they will be so peculiar as to what they want, how they want their dish. That’s why the bearers/waiters in France are considered the experts because they can give the way people want their desired dish. And it should be cooked right then and this and that and all that...and if you look at the taste, its absolutely waste. Don’t know what they keep on doing, one hour man wasted there on I want this and I want that. Today I want to eat this, tomorrow I would like to eat that and then day after I will eat that. Then we have people on our side who have disease for “Upvas” Fasting. This is a new one, good one that go for fasting. If they want to do fasting then they are thinking ahead of time,  “oh tomorrow is fast then what to eat. Well in fast we can only eat singhare ka atta. (a particular type of flour in India which is made out of a fuit”). Ok, then to get that will go to “Khari-Baoli” (a place in delhi) where to get that. And what if we won’t find it...then will call somebody and person agrees to get that. Then he goes to get it. Then like this the fasting trend goes in the air. Another thing fasting on Friday. For what? “Goddess Santoshi” Oh, you should never fast on that day. The day she is born, who has told you to fast on that day? Now how far should I go on to tell you these tricks of brahmins, a few of them are here and they will come and hit me on my head. The day someone is born they tell you to fast. They tell you to fast on “Sankarshti.” Now you tell me if this is common sense to fast on the day when Shri Ganesha was born.There should be some sense in it. It should have some meaning in it. The day Mother Santoshi was born they tell you to fast. The same day you are not suppose to eat sour, means the things she likes to eat you should avoid. Is this a way to please her or a trick of negative “Tantrikas” (people who use the name of the goddess for black magic) which means the things she likes you don’t do. That displeases Mother Goddess. 
First thing I tell you is that I don’t like children on fasting. There is no need to do fasting. What trouble you are in that you have to fast? Yea, I mean if you don’t feel like eating today then you can some fruits and done. That’s it. But there is no need to do fasting in Sahaja Yoga. Do I need T.B. patients here? They make this picture of Christ like a T.B. patient, where he is standing and his hands and legs appear to be as thin as if there are just bones. You should think yourself that can Christ be like this? Think yourself. Use some brains. That how can it be possible. Christ, was the one who was so divine, so great, charming like flower and so energetic that he could beat ten people like you. Now these devil, French artists. The ones who themselves walk like women. They made Christ like that so what can be done. Atleast nobody would make Shri Ram Chandra like that in our country. (laughter-everybody laughs with Mother) There is atleast that much sense we have in our country whenever they will make Rama Chandra or Mother Sita they will create a healthy, wealthy, plumpy, beautiful personality. Nobody would make such a diseased looking kind of images where skin is all going inside their being. How can such personality do any benevolence to people. So there is no need to do fasting. Gandiji did it for all once during “Satyagrah moment” (One of the moment during freedom struggle of India) no need for you all do to fasting. Mother will not be happy with this. It does not mean that you go on eating. (laughter-everyone laughs with Mother) Man goes to extreme you see, that oh Mother said to eat. So now lets eat and then next day you come to me saying Mother please treat my stomach. You should eat whatever is required. It should not be too much and it shouldn’t be too less. But something in between. There is no extreme to it. One should use some discretion. Commonly one can say that one’s attention shouldn’t be on food too much. There should be some distance (*Text unclear) As per the righteous act under dharma it makes sense to follow that you eat what is made by the gruhalaxmi (housewife). Vibrated and good food. You can say what is dharmic should be eaten. It does not mean that I am talking about vegetarianism and non-vegetarianism. No, not at all! See the extreme in that also. Jains have gone too far in vegetarianism that I don’t understand how to explain this to them. So they will one brahmin in a room and all the available mosquitoes or bugs in that town are brought in that room to that brahmin. Now these bugs bite that brahmin and suck his blood. And he is given money for this act as a token of respect. Now you tell me if this their vegetarianism. Do I have to give realization to mosquitoes? Or do I have to give it to the hens? I have to give it to humans. What will you do by saving hens? Don’t be overlyl kind to these bugs and hens otherwise I will be giving lectures to these guys only. So in a simple way you should continue with life and whatever is required can be followed. But with these kind of ideas sometimes funny and dangerous situations can arise. Like I’ll tell you a story where a personality named “Lama” reached in Denmark, Lama, name Lama! And there he said that I only walk on marble floor. So these children who were his followers collected some money and got marble flooring done for him. Just imagine now in Denmark, poor guys had to go for marble. After that this Lama guy reached there with a shaved head and said that I am a vegetarian and you guys also have to go vegetarian. Now you see, in Denmark you can’t get so much of vegetables. Poor guys get only potatoes easily and not much. All started following vegetarianism and became thin and their skin going inside them. And Lama eats quite well and was plumpy. So I asked them one day what did this guy tell you about sex life and all. They told me that he said to them that its in our culture and it’s fine to do whatever you like. At the end I heard this. This is a truth you won’t believe that two of the girls came from him and told me “Mataji, we have become pregnant over there” This is their vegetarianism. All other men who were there this guy had (text 1- weaken/text2- beaten them) Because normally whatever a person eats in his life if you wein them with that he will turn weak. And once he is weak, its very easy to put bhoots in that person. So make someone weak first and then fill him with bhoots. Rama Chandra ji (Shri Rama) was a “Khatriya” (warrior as per their born religion) and he used to eat everything or not? For whom did he kill a deer? Jains have went this far in their understanding and have even said for Shri Krishna that he was not God. Why? They said because he did not kill anyone. So for devils if Shri Krishna won’t kill then who else, would these jains go and kill? Should rakshas (demons/devils) not be killed? Is that voilence? Voilence also comes under the dhrama. (Righteousness) All that is benevolent is dharmic and has to be performed. Infact anger also has to be shown. If you don’t get angry bhoots don’t run away. Sometimes have to shout at them to scare them away then he runs otherwise it doesn’t go away. So there is no harm in shouting if by doing that bhoots go away, should do it or would you fold your hands and request him to leave the body of the person as you are nonvoilent. So if you be this soft to the bhoot then with these pleadings bhoot will come on you as well. Where there is a requirement to shout one has to shout. You must see that earlier people use to take a broom and hit the bhoot in the person with it really hard and shout at the bhoot to leave the body. Sometimes I have to scare them by saying that I will give you a curse if you won’t go. Then they pack and go. You should see this sometime, it is very interesting kind of a thing. So there is weired thing that it is said that “One shouldn’t get angry”. Once we were having a program in Mumbai and quite a lot of people were there. In that program one person was possessed with a bhoot and started acting. So he came up and ripped a book, threw at me and kind of misbehaved by using abusive words and all that. I kept quiet and just witnessed. So some people got upset with him saying that he can’t misbehave with Mother like this. On this the possessed guy said “you all are sahaja yogies, you should sit quietly and should not get angry” then I told them to give two solid slaps and if he says anything more, give him to the police. Then he ran for his life. It means that those days are gone where saints and sages were torchered and troubled. Now in these days if anybody will even look at these saints with bad eyes, then those eyes would be destroyed. Without that these negativities are not going away. Who has given this right to human beings to torture  these saintly people all the time. This is a new era. Enough of it. Now in these time all the wrong which is hiding within them will be brought outside and exposed. All those who have performed adharmic activities will be given a lesson. No body has right to exploit saints and sages. Earlier there was a saying that if someone will do such a thing will be under sins now whoever does anything wrong, it will be shown the same time. (Kind of instant karma fruit) otherwise the problems of saintly people would never go away. How much these saints have been exploited. This is because of adharma, when there is adhrama in your nabhi chakra. When complete adharma covers this whole thing then Shri Vishnu takes his incarnation. He has incarnated himself in many forms and you know he has even come as a woman once. He comes to protect these saintly personalities and at that time as i have told you earlier also that Shri Durga here on your center heart comes sakshat as Shri Jagdamba. She has incarnated many times. It is said that she took one thousand incarnations but she has also taken some “ansh-avtaras” (means partial incarnations) And she comes in this world to protect. To protect the Satva, she protects the satva-gunas. (qualities of the central channel). After receiving that protection when a person rises then she sits here on the center heart as Jagdamba. Heart chakra is in the center and heart is to your left which has Shri Shiva as the residing deity which is also known as the “atma swarupa” (spirit) so Shri Shiva resides in the heart.  If somebody says that I got a heart attack then if we tell him to ask for forgiveness and say “oh lord of compassion, please forgive us, if we have done any mistake, in any way if have done anything wrong you kindly forgive us. ” 
“Kara-charana krutam va kayajam karmajam va
Shravana nayanajam va manasam v’ aparadham
Vihitam-avihitam va sarvam’etat kshamasva
Jaya jay Karun’abhe He Maha-deva Shambho” 
This is the mantra to cure his heart. I bet you if his heart does not get well with this mantra. But you can’t do it. A realized soul is required to say this because his connection will be the divine. And if he asks for forgiveness it will be granted because he is bhole shankar. But connection has to be there. Rather if you are his devotee you will get a heart attack. Yes, you will definitely get it. Why? Because without his permission,“baap-re-baap” (Oh my god) Shiv ji! Even if you have to meet Prime Minister you write one hundred letters and then he is Shri Shiva, everybody’s grandfather’s grandfather he is. He is a very great thing. Just like that you take his name is not advisable.(text unclear) No. His name shouldn’t be chanted without realization. Look at what kind of people he is surrounded with. All these ganas will give you left and right to make you alright. That’s why before realization you shouldn’t take his name and after realization also you should become very humble and seek forgiveness for yourself and then should take his name. You need a lot of humility if you desire to worship his name. He is only attracted by humility. Because of this humility itself a lot of great demons were also able to achieve him. A person should be very humble. He is pleased with those who always look at their own faults and be humble at his lotus feet. If you want to (Shri Mataji telling someone in marathi language not to take photographs in between the lecture as it disturbs. What is so special to take picture while I am lecturing.) This is the place of Shri Shiva. Shiva resides within us as “atma-swarupa” (spirit) in our heart. Like light of lamp its always illuminating in our hearts. It knows everything within us as to what is happening, what is not happening. It is called as “Khetragya”. In front of that lord “Parameshwara” do not do any mistakes. If you have done any mistake seek for forgivness. You heart chakra will be caught up if you have done any mistake. That’s why you should think of any mistakes you might have done and ask for forgiveness. You can’t think of anything then you should pray “Lord if we have done anything wrong please forgive us for that.” Without his forgiveness heart can’t be alright. Now any kind of extreme behaviour can easily displease him. That’s why I tell “Hatha yogis” to leave “Hatha-yoga” or else they will get heart attack. Only by doing few kinds of “asanas” (positions type) is not “Hatha-yoga” there are six kinds of things one needs to follow. Like you know there should be routine and discipline, only “brahmachari” ascetic should be allowed to do it and that too by the age of twenty five he should be done with all of this yoga in a forest. This is written in “Patanjali-Yoga”  if you read it you will know. And its not written anywhere that those who live in households are allowed to do it.  No where it is written. One should have a guru, one should have a desire to be one with God. Out of these “Pranayam and Vyayam” are very two small things about “asanas” (yoga exercise) Specially about these asanas, you should know about your chakras which are weak and they need workout. Now you have stomach problem but you are doing asana for you throat. So then you spoil your throat along with your stomach. There is science as to what should be done where and how. Which mantra is to be used where is also a complete science. If your heart chakra is caught up and you are spending time in Shri Vishnu’s devotion then how will it benefit you. As a result you will get Vishudhi problems because its without permission so you will get Vishudhi chakra, then Shri Shiva will be upset with you and because you are taking the name of Shri Vishnu so your stomach will also get disturbed. So unnecessarily you will end up on the bed or in the hospital. Then they will say “Mataji, we are very dharmic people and we pray everyday even then we are here in the hospital.” Now here your ignorance is at fault. The biggest thing is that everything can be forgiven. God can forgive anything, everything can be alright if you stabilize yourself on one thing and that is “Shradha” (enlightened faith). Faith is a very great thing. If you have faith in God innocently without any questions then one day or the other you will definitely get one with God and besides anything wrong done by such person also earns forgiveness. If he thinks about God at that time he will be forgiven because god knows that he is connected to me because of his Indestructible faith. But these days people have no faith and everything has become a fashion/trend. That’s why it takes an opposite form. That’s why man starts to get opposite results. Whatever he tries to do to get some good out of the thing it turns the results completely opposite. Like I told you that all the people from “Hare-Rama Hare-Krishna”  have got throat cancer. So many come to me from there and I tell them to open a cancer hospital rahter than an ashram. Now if you tell them they are like we do “Hare Rama Hare-Krishna” why did we get cancer? So the reason is that you are taking the name of Shri Krishna from your Vishudhi and you haven’t had any permission from him. You should take his permission. If you just start taking his name morning till evening, then is he your servant? But this understanding comes to you when you get cancer then somebody says Mataji can cure cancer then they come to the line. You will be surprised to know that they are in such bad condition that if I try to ask them any question they just keep on repeating the same words. So likewise by doing any such kind of stupidities one can get many problems. You can see that small thing like electricity which is such a simple power but if you put your finger somewhere then you get a shock so this great tremendous power of the God which is flowing and to have disrespectful and ignorant behaviour can be very dangerous one should know. That’s why today I am going to tell you each and everything about it. (Unclear text) I am not going to hide anything from you. I am going to tell you each and everything about this power. So later you don’t complain me that Mother you didn’t tell me about it. For this you need to understand, here I told you that its Shri Rama’s place, on the right side. He is on “Rajoguna” as "Maryada Purushotama” on the “Pingala nadi”. Now about him what should one say about him as you know whatever is said in his glory and about him is not enough. But he is (Text-1 embodiment of fatherhood/text-2 embodiment of good conduct and boundaries of good man). Like say, when our this father principle is disturbed then this chakra goes out of order. For if we do not act well towards our father or as father then also it gets affected. Especially when men who run after other women and don’t respect their wives they get this chakra. They get breathing problem. (Asthma) Direct result. If you are catching on your heart to your right means you are against the principle of Shri Rama where he had only one wife. Then you shouldn’t get married. At the time of wedding you get so super excited and after marriage you think that your wife is worst woman you have ever met. Whatever your wife you should consider her like lakshmi and should accept her. That’s the principal of Shri Rama of one woman but if you can’t keep to this….I mean if you are having some adjustment problems and all that then we have some treatments in Sahaja yoga to get it right. You can bring the person to the right path but can’t show disrespect to the person. But if you insult that person then it means that you are devoid of this principle of Shri Rama on your right heart. The same way Shri Rama was an ideal king and if some king falls down from his ideal behaviour then also he gets the same chakra. Means he was like father and king should be like that who lives in his boundary. You will ask now that what if a woman becomes characterless then what happens so if that happens then she gets caught up on her left side. Her left of the heart will be caught up and if she gets that means she has become characterless. If she gets her central side caught up then one breast cancer can develop. When a woman feels that her sense of security has gone bad. When a woman looses her sense of security then she gets breast cancer. If such a situation arises then the solution is to provide security to the woman. Lot of women get Asthma problem, their heart beat goes off the track then also its the same thing that her sense of security is challenged. Like here we have a rule that when new daughter-in-law comes to the house we have to torture her it won’t feel like she has come to her in-laws. As soon as the bride comes to the house we put thousand and one blames on her starting from her great grand fathers and then will go on..saying that your father did this and he was like this and you are like this and you are like that and no good etc. So when things like this start then the girl’s center heart gets caught up and she develops the insecurity. When this insecurity starts to settle in then she develps this catch and due to which she gets breast cancer. In England and America this disease is way too much because there nor man is stable neither woman is stable. In that imbalanced situation women get this problem because woman in her hearts of heart thinks that they should have a home, their husband should be with them and they live comfortably with their kids. But due to social norms if the situation gets imbalanced then these problems arise. And above that there is this Vishudhi Chakra that I was telling you about the other day. This Vishudhi Chakra is constructed or made with with sixteen petals. We have these similar sixteen sub plexuses which are in cervical plexus. Our ears, nose, throat, muscles of our mouth, outside part of our eyes is all governed and taken care by this chakra. Infact when you get sinus problem that is also the result of disturbance in this chakra. It’s two branches go towards our hands as well. That is why sometimes people get their realization but they don’t get any feeling on their hands. If that happens then you should get it that you got your realization but the reason you can’t feel vibrations on your hand is because your Vishudhi Chakra is disturbed or not alright. On Vishudhi Chakra Shri Vishnu becomes the Virata, Virata. Means collective. When a person does not have collectivity in him, he is very self centered, he just thinks about himself and has no thought towards others or society then also this chakra gets caught up. Second thing is tobacco as we are aware of this thing. (Uncear audio). Tobacco is reincarnation of “Putana” (a female demon who came on the earth when Shri Krishna was born) She is always after Shri Krishna. If we take that in any form then this chakra of ours gets caught up. This is the Virata. Virata, the one we call it as “Akbara” that is why muslims call it “Allah-ho-Akbar”. The Akbar Mohammed spoke about was Shri Krishna. He spoke about Krishna, he is the one who takes the form of Virata.There can’t be any fight of Mohammed and Krishna as one was the guru he was the Viraata. Then you will say then Krishna was greater than him. So tell me in your case, if your eyes are bigger or nose? That your ear is bigger or your mouth? Everyone has their own space their own importance. (Shri Mataji points towards the human chakra chart and describes the Virata). So this Virata..you can imagine this body as Virataa and that the chakras are within the Virata’s body and you all are inside that being as cells. You can call it as Microcosm and Macrocosm. Means that from these small cells this bigger being is created and every cells is a replica of the of the bigger being. When these small cells inside the Virata get this awareness that they are part and parcel of the whole at that moment they get their self realization. You come to the collective consciousness. You can start to feel the chakras say for example of this lady, like where is her attention, where is her kundalini. Even small children when they get this blessing of the Virata, of the collective consciousness they can tell, like this girl Pragya and also my grandaghter who is just two years of age but she can tell you which chakras you are caught up on. Because fingers become sensitive to the feeling of vibrations to this new awareness that this new thing enables to guess where are catching and what it is. It is very important to understand the aspect of Virata. When you consume tobacco then you destroy the Virata within you. The Virata which is within you in the form of collective consciousness, you destroy that. This is such a dirty thing, you see. It such a bad thing that you can estimate it. Once a question was asked, “Why did God create such a thing in this world? So the answer is to kill the insects and bugs it was created. Its an insecticide. God didn’t know this stupid human being will start eating an insecticide. He didn’t know he just made it. What should he do? Then they will ask that why alcohol was created, so it was created just for polishing. It’s only a polish, polish. Somewhere its metal polish, wood polish, sometimes if you want to polish diamonds you can use “jinn” for that. Its only a polish, who told you to drink polish? No God told you this, right? Then why did you start drinking? If tomorrow you start eating soil and may be something even worse than that then what to do? What is God’s fault in it? Or your own mind is at fault? If you drink this polish then you won’t have any hangover but you will drink that which is a bad thing. And I don’t get one thing is when one person goes into drink and he comes out in a (unclear text*) way then those who are watching should run but ten more will go inside. Now see what kind of a brain/intelligence a man has. One person just came out and fell into a ditch/sewer lane then others should take a lesson from this and should run away from this thing but rather those ten will also inside and get the same kind of hangover to fall in the same ditch/sewer lane. They are like give us also to drink, then they will write poem on it, articles on it, big (unclear text)....that I started talking about alcohol and eight to ten people are ready to go out. (People start to look around then Shri Mataji says...) They didn’t leave yet, didn’t leave yet. (laughter-everyone laughs with Mother) I am giving a prospect that I took this topic of Alcohol and they are ready to leave. (laughter again) So instead should I be saying that son, go ahead and drink as much as you like? Well, there are gurus who do that. They say dear children go ahead and drink, you can smoke tobacco, live your life to destroy it but just hand your purse/wallet over to me. Just this much arrangement for me. Then I don’t have any objections for you to go for gambling, thefts, mafia and even murder people! Keep your purse here. So this much is our relationship that whatever may happen but from your earnings I should be able to get atleast sixteenth part of it. (Shri Mataji laughs sarcastically on these gurus) Here at this point on this chakra Shri Krishna is present in his complete form. A human being comes to this complete form only when he reaches to the state of “Sakshi-swarupa” witness. When this whole world appears to him as a “Leela” a play. Everything is like a play. This can only happen when you become realized. Krishna, apart from this is a great incarnation of diplomacy. Diplomacy of the whole world comes from the lotus feet of Shri Krishna. He was such a diplomat that he has trciked you all for many years. (Unclear text-not sure how to put these words in english) like he gave the theory of “Karma” (action or duties in routine) where you go on doing the duties or karma but leave the fruit of those karmas (work) at the lotus feet of the Divine/God. In second chapter itself Krishna told Arjuna to achieve the highest, to absorb the knowledge, indirectly basically he was told get to the self realization. So Arjuna couldn’t understand the fact and he asked Krishna that one side you tell me to be realized and a witness and on the other side you tell me to go for the war. So Shri Krishna said “I got it…” because he is a diplomat. I will explain you so imagine there is a child playing a bullock cart or horse cart and the horse is behind the cart and the father comes out of his hut and tells him to switch and child does not want to change he wants to continue the same way he is playing. So the father says alright. So attention should be on the horse. A human being is still playing with it. From last six thousand years he is doing the same thing. So many people I have met who tell me that Mataji, I only perfom my karmas and the fruit I leave at the lotus feet of God. You will find these kind of self satisfied people a lot. It is not possible. This is diplomacy. What is the essence of diplomacy? Let me tell you the essence of diplomacy which is that put the absurd condition in front. A person will fall trap into his own web. Now, see the play of the words here where He said that you do your karma and leave the fruit at the feet of God. Its an impossible situation where this is an absurd condition. Now human being is trying to do it like stupid. Alright, keep on doing. Unless and until you are (text-1 detached, text-2- broken) until your “karma” becomes “akarma”,  until you become empty from within this can’t be achieved because ego and superego are sitting on your head. Whatever you will do it will be either by the force of ego or by superego. So how can you surrender to God unless you have a connection with God. He infact said:- 
“Karmanye vadhikaraste phaleshu ma kadachan” (This is 47th sanskrit shloka from second chapter of the Gita, which insists on the importance of doing karma and not getting attached to the result or the fruit as it is in the hands of the Lord.) Krishna said this and that too by putting this absurd condition because its not easy to get human beings to the right understanding. I am watching that even after six thousand years the situation is still the same. But I am a Mother so I will say that son, don’t feel bad but bring that horse to the front. Whether you agree or not I can bring that horse in front and put it right. Forcefully I should bring your horse right because from last six thousand years man is trying hard and for how long he would do it? Then in Bhakti yoga also he has shown great diplomacy as again being a diplomat. What to do, can’t do without diplomacy. He said “Pushapam phalam toyam” 
(full shloka- Patram pushpam phalam toyam 
Yo me bhaktya prayacchati,
Tad Aham bhakty-upahritam
Ashnami prayaytatmanah”)
He said in bhakti yes whatever you will give me- fruits, flowers, leaves anything I will accept that but while giving, I will accept anything that you will give me but notice here you notice the play of his words that it should be given in “Ananya Bhakti” Anaya word is the trick of the play.
I have heard in many lectures where people say to do “Ananya Bhakti” Ananya means there is no one else, when you are one with the divine you become self realized then you do the bhakti. Has played on the word “Ananya Bhakti” the all the people are still playing. From last six thousand years no one has been able to understand this part which says that Anaya bhakti means when you get your realization first then go in bhakti. When there is no one else in your bhakti that state comes only when you become realized not before that. The same way he described yoga. But he had been compassionate enough, that’s why his name was “Krishna” means the one who does the “Krishi”  (means the farming) he did this farming. The meaning of Krishna is the one who did the krishi (farming). He did the farming part and now I am reeping the fruits or say flowers of those who are ready. He did the farming. He was Krishna. It has been six thousand years no problem, but even now he is present in our throat. When he is awakened in our throat then we can spread our hands toward the Virata and can know that in everyone human being I reside. (unclear text) Like there are various types of gems but a same thread runs between or through them the same way when you come on your (Text-1-2 channel/thread/system) the same moment you are also able to go the other’s system as well. This is the thing which is known as collective consciousness. Thanks to the scientists and psychologists, (name of the person is not clear) has said that “Next step to awareness is collective consciousness”. (text1- Yung) said that who was the student of Freud. Look at this interesting fact also. He came as a student to Freud and revolted against him and he proved that human beings have collective consciousness in them. To prove his theory they observed the dreams of some people and in that observation he collected this information that everyone who gets a dream gets a (unclear text) symbols and these symbols are the same whether the person is in England, America, India or Timbuktu. Like say for example someone is going to do a murder then he gets a special type of triangle in his life as image and that the point of that triangle would be positioned towards the downward direction. And if someone is going to get murdered (victim) then he will be getting some image of a triangle where the point of that triangle would be positioned toward the upward direction. Like this they have examined hundreds of dreams and proved that there is some kind of power within us which always gives us a balance, warns us in our dreams. Not only this but it also gives us warnings in symbolic way that this is not alright and that one should not do it. Like so he has done many. He has volumes after volumes of his books, if you get a chance you should read it. He was a great sahaja yogi but very few people recognized him. He struggled a lot in his life and had to face a lot. Every wise had to suffer like that no wise man was ever able to get this many good listeners. This is the first time ever that even gods from heaven are happy to see that so many people are listening to Mother. Otherwise it was hard to get even person and if another one comes the first one will go away. So its like that puzzle in mathematics which says that on a construction once one person came and left the work half done second one came left the work quarter done then when will the work finish? It will never finish if you will have such kind of people. Sahaja yoga shares the similar story. Maximum people we get are like that. They will come get their self realization, done. Someone will be cured of his disease,then they are like- “ah, Mother cured us”. Then gone. Those who actually stay and get settled in Sahaja are very few. Very Few. There is no end to knowledge as far as Vishuddhi chakra is concerned. Once you start getting vibrations and slowly start to (text-1visualize/..) and will understand the greatness of Vishuddhi Chakra.  Now in this void we have two great entities as well which we know as “Chandra” (moon) and “Surya” (sun). Moon and Sun are such chakras which reside on these “nadis”(channels) here and here (Shri Mataji probably pointing towards the chakra chart and refer) On these chakras there are two very great personalities who have been appointed. They are complete embodiment of human beings. They are like humans in fact are humans. Out of these one is Buddha and one is Mahavira. But if you listen to the whole history of their lives then these are two sons which Shri Sita had as “Luv and Kusha” who is completely in human form. And after they evolved to the level that they are here as Buddha and Mahavira. There also they thought they have reached an extreme of non-violence because the supports of non-violence came in and started protecting even mosquitoes and bugs. Then they again took birth and came at the time of Mohammed. Mohammed was an incarnation of Shri Janaka. (Father of Shri Sita) and his daughter Fatima Bi was also incarnation of Shri Sita. Then as their sons as Hassan and Hussain they gave their life in Karbala to prove that no kind of extreme is good. And this thing is truth or not you can see on your vibrations. If I am lying then through your vibrations you would know that not even one single word is a lie here that I am telling you. And their two positions are here on our head (Shri Mataji probably pointing towards the chakra chart to show their position on head). If your left nabhi is catching then realize that the Mahavira is not alright. If Mahavira position is going alright means that you are very rigid kind of a person. Means starting from morning you will be like can’t eat this, can’t drink that, can’t touch that, can’t do that, need a crisp ironed shirt and all that after shower. Being this kind of a stiff personality gets you left nabhi. If you get that then you have to take the names of Shri Mahavira. And your right nabhi catches when you become very egoistical. In terms of food, I like that...I like small chopped potatoes with methi. ( a dish in india which is made with greens of fenugreek seed and potatoes) then your nabhi gets caught up/gone. I like such kind of bathroom. Are you “Aga Khan”? You like the palace of “Aga Khan” then what should we do. So acting in such “tanashahi” way (dictatorship) I didn’t like this thing, I went there and I didn’t like their clothes, I don’t like the saree you are wearing, then you are gone. This is Buddha's work. In this way, egoistical people get their this chakra caught up. And in this way both sun and the moon channel get caught up. Mahavira has went so deep on the left channel that he has described even what all happens in hell how it happens and what kind of snakes and bugs and insects and smell is there and even then these jains have got no wisdom at all. Not at all they have got any sense. If you read that then you will pull your ears and say “Mother we don’t want to go to hell”. Do whatever else but if this is hell we don’t want this. In fashion you do hundreds of things but keep this in mind that you will go to hell. Someone had this joke I will tell then I will finish my lecture today and then there are two more chakras which we will do tomorrow. 
Some gentleman shared this funny story/joke once. That there was a nice dharmic and peaceful person and when he passed away he was brought to God and from there he was directed towards the heaven. He went there and saw that yogies were meditating there and he saw here also sahaja yogies are meditating and i was meditating on earth also. Everyone is just enjoying the meditation and bhajans and all. There is no fun. It has been same for me so there should be fun also and some change. So he requested God that I have heard a lot about Hell, I would like see their fun and what all they do there so please allow me to go to hell. So God said -okay you can go this way. He goes there and see people are having romance, women are dancing, lot of alocohol and cigratte, drama is going on, songs, music, dirty and vulgar conversations are going on and all. Like the scene you have in discotheque. He thought okay yea, this looks like good to me. I can enjoy here...So he stood there and someone asked so what are doing here? He replied I wanted to come to Hell and God has send me here, so I am here to enjoy. They said alright, you take this way and go from that door over there. So he went. As soon as he opened the door he saw people being fried in big big pots, some were hanging upside down, someone’s throat was being slit, somewhere very weired kind of creatures were crawling upon men and eating them up and people were standing like (unclear text). He got a fright of his life and came out running. He asked what is all that inside? Here you all are enjoying and inside is devastating. They said this is our publicity department of hell. (Everybody laughs with Shri Mataji) So get allured with this publicity department. I am telling you, if you don’t trust me read Mahavira, if I am lying. He has explained about all seven kinds of hell. So don’t go the way to hell my child. Now you imagine, i think about it and I feel how should i talk to my children about it. So if a Mother knows what hell is and she knows about it she would hold her kids tight and would shout that don’t go that way of hell. She can stay hungry and would do anything to stop her kids from going there. You can get this understanding only from those who know about it. I know about it and have seen it that why I am telling you not to go by their publicity department and shouting and requesting you to walk on the right path. By saying this I end my lecture for today its eight-o-clock now and tomorrow we will talk about the next two chakras and will have conversation on kundalini awakening and what happens with that also about conscious mind and all. So you all come again tomorrow and take notes of my lecture, read it, understand it, and get realized. For kundalini awakening experience and meditation come in the morning as I work on that part during the day because we don’t have time for that now. Not only that but in morning if I will also cure if someone needs that but for now lecture went on for really long. In fact I wasn’t expecting that but vibrations were very strong. Those who have got cool vibrations on their hands have got their realization. But one has to get established in it, get immersed in it, it is a very subtle hapening. For now you are not that subtle. Please note this thing inside the hearts of your hearts that unless and until you know the value of something you can’t desire to attain it. I have made this thing very simple by working hard on it but still you would need to work hard on yourself and make your instrument alright. I can only start your car. With great joy I share with you that with the help of Hindi department after great analysis and work of seven years a book has been printed and released in hindi language. You all should get that book, take home and read it. You will get a lot of knowledge that will help you. But only book can’t help you either as experience is must. If you haven’t got the experience then everything is a waste. (Seems like some asked Shri Mataji about the price of the book and in response she says) No no there has to be some price. One rupee each? Whatever your shraddha is...Must not be less than a rupee, right? (everyone laughs) No, you should definitely have some price, otherwise I have seen human nature that if you just give them like that then they use it for (unclear) car, its good. Let’s use it. So it shouldn’t be treated like that. It has a great importance. This photo here has got vibrations, that’s why keep it in a proper place and use it in a proper way. From the picture itself thousands have got their self realization in western countries and have got rid of their diseases. That’s why don’t insult the photograph. I am telling you in advance. I am not as simple as I appear. A lot of personalities are sitting within me so don’t try to do anything wrong. One is Shri Hanumana who is standing right there on the door, when you are leaving he will give you all one pappach. Go home straight forward, humbly and acting respectfully towards the photograph. I am telling you this. This is the photograph. You all can get it. One rupee is not much anyone. Otherwise if we start distributing for free then its done. Some are standing outside who can get it from there.
