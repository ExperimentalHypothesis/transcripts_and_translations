1978-01-31 Advice in Delhi, Part 1 - Rajoguna and Swadishthana Chakra - Lakshmipati, Delhi

[translation version 1]

I have told you about the Nabhi Chakra and also about the Void. The guru principle resides in this “Bhavasagara” (ocean of illusion) and this Guru principle establishes the dharma within us. These ten petals here that we have shown are the ones which establish the ten dharmas within us. (Shri Mataji points towards the petals on the chart). It is important to have these ten dharmas in a human being otherwise he is not a human being.

Even if he has nine dharmas in him is still [Inaudible] a bit and if he does not follow these dharmas that are within him, and when I say dharma I don’t mean by Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, and all that but dharma means the innate dharma (religion) of humanity within, if one does not keep to those ten dharmas then he turns into a devil. This Guru tattwa has taken birth in this world in many forms especially it has these ten main incarnations have taken birth like Raja Janaka, Nanak, Mohamad saa’b etc. and at the end it was Sai Nath from Shirdi, who took birth. They tie this tattwa/moral within us because all these gurus who have taken birth for our evolution are placed within us.

[Unclear] These Gurus are very subtly placed deities within us. Like for these Gurus already say: “Don’t consume alcohol”, then they weren’t mad that they said this. Neither were they standing in any elections to win votes that they said that. You can’t even say that they had any kind of business that in some competitive feeling he said that thing. They said: “Child, don’t drink alcohol, don’t take to cigarettes, don’t take any kind of drugs” because the position of our attention within is also placed in the area of void.

You will be surprised to know that our attention is in our stomach. Actually, to be specific, in liver resides our attention. They said you don’t drink alcohol so your attention does not get spoiled. You know by drinking human awareness gets damaged. People got the other way by saying ok, if drinking is not allowed then lets not garlic, onions, etc. Prophet Mohamad used to eat garlic, onions and also Nanaka used to eat meat and all that, attention should not be wasted on food etc. what we would in the morning, what we would eat in dinner, what you will eat today, what will you eat tomorrow and so on.

I went to Paris, I was shocked to see how much time people spend on the thought of what would you eat. An hour before they will make you sit down and there will be a discussion on what will you eat, they will bring you a menu then people will decide “okay I will eat this, I will eat that”... and on top of it there will be an intensity about their deep interest in that particular dish. Does everyone has the same taste or what? They will make you work hard in this one hour and after this discussion now they will keep drinking wine. After that, God knows what they like...Then they will be so peculiar as to what they want, how they want their dish. That’s why the waiters in France are considered the experts because they can give the way people want their desired dish. And it should be cooked right then and this and that and all that...and if you look at the taste, its absolutely waste. Don’t know what they keep on doing, one hour man wasted there on I want this and I want that. Today I want to eat this, tomorrow I would like to eat that and then day after I will eat that.

Then we have people on our side who have disease for “Upvas” Fasting. This is a new one, good one that go for fasting. If they want to do fasting then they are thinking ahead of time, “oh tomorrow is fast then what to eat. Well in fast we can only eat singhare ka atta. (a particular type of flour in India which is made out of a fruit”). Ok, then to get that will go to “Khari-Baoli” (a place in Delhi) where to get that. And what if we won’t find it...then will call somebody and person agrees to get that. Then he goes to get it. Then like this the fasting trend goes in the air. Another thing fasting on Friday. For what? “Goddess Santoshi” Oh, you should never fast on that day. The day she is born, who has told you to fast on that day? Now how far should I go on to tell you these tricks of brahmins, a few of them are here and they will come and hit me on my head. The day someone is born they tell you to fast. They tell you to fast on “Sankarshti.” Now you tell me if this is common sense to fast on the day when Shri Ganesha was born.There should be some sense in it. It should have some meaning in it. The day Mother Santoshi was born they tell you to fast. The same day you are not suppose to eat sour, means the things she likes to eat you should avoid. Is this a way to please her or a trick of negative “Tantrikas which means the things she likes you don’t do. That displeases Mother Goddess.

First thing I tell you is that I don’t like children on fasting. There is no need to do fasting. What trouble you are in that you have to fast? Yea, I mean if you don’t feel like eating today then you can some fruits and done. That’s it. But there is no need to do fasting in Sahaja Yoga. Do I need T.B. patients here? They make this picture of Christ like a T.B. patient, where he is standing and his hands and legs appear to be as thin as if there are just bones. You should think yourself that can Christ be like this? Think yourself. Use some brains. That how can it be possible. Christ, was the one who was so divine, so great, charming like flower and so energetic that he could beat ten people like you. Now these devil, French artists. The ones who themselves walk like women. They made Christ like that so what can be done. At least nobody would make Shri Rama Chandra like that in our country. (laughter-everybody laughs with Mother). There is atleast that much sense we have in our country whenever they will make Rama Chandra or Mother Sita they will create a healthy, wealthy, plumb, beautiful personality.

Nobody would make such a diseased looking kind of images where skin is all going inside their being. How can such personality do any benevolence to people. So there is no need to do fasting. Gandiji did it for all once during “Satyagrah moment” (One of the moment during freedom struggle of India) no need for you all do to fasting. Mother will not be happy with this. It does not mean that you go on eating. (laughter-everyone laughs with Mother) Man goes to extreme you see, that oh Mother said to eat. So now lets eat and then next day you come to me saying Mother please treat my stomach. You should eat whatever is required. It should not be too much and it shouldn’t be too less. But something in between. There is no extreme to it. One should use some discretion.

Commonly one can say that one’s attention shouldn’t be on food too much. There should be some distance [unclear] As per the righteous act under dharma it makes sense to follow that you eat what is made by the Gruha Laxmi (housewife). Vibrated and good food. You can say what is dharmic should be eaten. It does not mean that I am talking about vegetarianism and non-vegetarianism. No, not at all! See the extreme in that also. Jains have gone too far in vegetarianism that I don’t understand how to explain this to them. So they will one Brahmin in a room and all the available mosquitoes or bugs in that town are brought in that room to that Brahmin. Now these bugs bite that Brahmin and suck his blood. And he is given money for this act as a token of respect. Now you tell me if this their vegetarianism. Do I have to give realization to mosquitoes? Or do I have to give it to the hens? I have to give it to humans. What will you do by saving hens? Don’t be overlyl kind to these bugs and hens otherwise I will be giving lectures to these guys only. So in a simple way you should continue with life and whatever is required can be followed. But with these kind of ideas sometimes funny and dangerous situations can arise.

Like I’ll tell you a story where a personality named “Lama” reached in Denmark, Lama, name Lama! And there he said that I only walk on marble floor. So these children who were his followers collected some money and got marble flooring done for him. Just imagine now in Denmark, poor guys had to go for marble. After that this Lama guy reached there with a shaved head and said that I am a vegetarian and you guys also have to go vegetarian. Now you see, in Denmark you can’t get so much of vegetables. Poor guys get only potatoes easily and not much. All started following vegetarianism and became thin and their skin going inside them. And Lama eats quite well and was plumb.

So I asked them one day what did this guy tell you about sex life and all. They told me that he said to them that its in our culture and it’s fine to do whatever you like. At the end I heard this. This is a truth you won’t believe that two of the girls came from him and told me “Mataji, we have become pregnant over there” This is their vegetarianism. All other men who were there this guy had (text 1- weaken/text2- beaten them) Because normally whatever a person eats in his life if you wean them with that he will turn weak. And once he is weak, it’s very easy to put bhoots in that person. So make someone weak first and then fill him with bhoots. Rama Chandra ji (Shri Rama) was a “Khatriya” (warrior as per their born religion) and he used to eat everything or not? For whom did he kill a deer? Jains have went this far in their understanding and have even said for Shri Krishna that he was not God. Why? They said because he did not kill anyone. So for devils if Shri Krishna won’t kill then who else, would these Jains go and kill? Should rakshasas not be killed? Is that violence?

Violence also comes under the dharma. (Righteousness) All that is benevolent is dharmic and has to be performed. In fact anger also has to be shown. If you don’t get angry bhoots don’t run away. Sometimes have to shout at them to scare them away then he runs otherwise it doesn’t go away. So there is no harm in shouting if by doing that bhoots go away, should do it or would you fold your hands and request him to leave the body of the person as you are non voilent. So if you be this soft to the bhoot then with these pleadings bhoot will come on you as well. Where there is a requirement to shout one has to shout. You must see that earlier people use to take a broom and hit the bhoot in the person with it really hard and shout at the bhoot to leave the body. Sometimes I have to scare them by saying that I will give you a curse if you won’t go. Then they pack and go. You should see this sometime, it is very interesting kind of a thing.

So there is weird thing that it is said that “One shouldn’t get angry”. Once we were having a program in Mumbai and quite a lot of people were there. In that program one person was possessed with a bhoot and started acting. So he came up and ripped a book, threw at me and kind of misbehaved by using abusive words and all that. I kept quiet and just witnessed. So some people got upset with him saying that he can’t misbehave with Mother like this. On this the possessed guy said “you all are Sahaja Yogis, you should sit quietly and should not get angry” then I told them to give two solid slaps and if he says anything more, give him to the police. Then he ran for his life. It means that those days are gone where saints and sages were torchered and troubled.

Now in these days if anybody will even look at these saints with bad eyes, then those eyes would be destroyed. Without that these negativities are not going away. Who has given this right to human beings to torture these saintly people all the time. This is a new era. Enough of it. Now in these time all the wrong which is hiding within them will be brought outside and exposed. All those who have performed adharmic activities will be given a lesson. No body has right to exploit saints and sages. Earlier there was a saying that if someone will do such a thing will be under sins now whoever does anything wrong, it will be shown the same time. (Kind of instant karma fruit) otherwise the problems of saintly people would never go away. How much these saints have been exploited. This is because of adharma, when there is adhrama in your Nabhi chakra. When complete adharma covers this whole thing then Shri Vishnu takes his incarnation.

He has incarnated himself in many forms and you know he has even come as a woman once. He comes to protect these saintly personalities and at that time as i have told you earlier also that Shri Durga here on your centre heart comes sakshat as Shri Jagadamba. She has incarnated many times. It is said that she took one thousand incarnations but she has also taken some “ansh-avtaras” (means partial incarnations) And she comes in this world to protect. To protect the Satva, she protects the satva-gunas. (qualities of the central channel). After receiving that protection when a person rises then she sits here on the center heart as Jagadamba. Heart Chakra is in the centre and heart is to your left which has Shri Shiva as the residing deity which is also known as the “atma swarupa” (Spirit) so Shri Shiva resides in the heart. If somebody says that I got a heart attack then if we tell him to ask for forgiveness and say “oh lord of compassion, please forgive us, if we have done any mistake, in any way if have done anything wrong you kindly forgive us. ”

“Kara-charana krutam va kayajam karmajam va
Shravana nayanajam va manasam v’ aparadham
Vihitam-avihitam va sarvam’etat kshamasva
Jaya jay Karun’abhe He Maha-deva Shambho”
This is the mantra to cure his heart. I bet you if his heart does not get well with this mantra. But you can’t do it. A realized soul is required to say this because his connection will be the divine. And if he asks for forgiveness it will be granted because he is bhole shankar. But connection has to be there. Rather if you are his devotee you will get a heart attack. Yes, you will definitely get it. Why? Because without his permission, “baap-re-baap” (Oh my god) Shiv ji! Even if you have to meet Prime Minister you write one hundred letters and then he is Shri Shiva, everybody’s grandfather’s grandfather he is. He is a very great thing. Just like that you take his name is not advisable.(text unclear) No. His name shouldn’t be chanted without realization. Look at what kind of people he is surrounded with. All these ganas will give you left and right to make you all right. That’s why before Realization, you shouldn’t take his name. And after Realization also, you should become very humble and seek forgiveness for yourself and then should take his name. 

You need a lot of humility if you desire to worship his name. He is only attracted by humility. Because of this humility itself a lot of great demons were also able to achieve him. A person should be very humble. He is pleased with those who always look at their own faults and be humble at his lotus feet. If you want to (Shri Mataji telling someone in Marathi language not to take photographs in between the lecture as it disturbs. What is so special to take picture while I am lecturing.) This is the place of Shri Shiva. Shiva resides within us as “atma-swarupa” (spirit) in our heart. Like light of lamp its always illuminating in our hearts. It knows everything within us as to what is happening, what is not happening. It is called as “KhetrAgnya”. In front of that lord “Parameshwara” do not do any mistakes. If you have done any mistake seek for forgiveness. Your Heart Chakra will be caught up if you have done any mistake. That’s why you should think of any mistakes you might have done and ask for forgiveness. You can’t think of anything then you should pray “Lord if we have done anything wrong please forgive us for that.” Without his forgiveness heart can’t be all right.

any kind of extreme behaviour can easily displease him. That’s why I tell “Hatha Yogis” to leave “Hatha Yoga” or else they will get heart attack. Only by doing few kinds of “asanas” (positions type) is not “Hatha Yoga” there are six kinds of things one needs to follow. Like you know there should be routine and discipline, only “brahmachari” ascetic should be allowed to do it and that too by the age of twenty five he should be done with all of this yoga in a forest. This is written in “Patanjali Yoga” if you read it you will know. And its not written anywhere that those who live in households are allowed to do it. No where it is written. One should have a guru, one should have a desire to be one with God. Out of these “Pranayam and Vyayam” are very two small things about “asanas” (yoga exercise) Specially about these asanas, you should know about your chakras which are weak and they need workout. Now you have stomach problem but you are doing asana for you throat. So then you spoil your throat along with your stomach.

There is science as to what should be done where and how. Which mantra is to be used where is also a complete science. If your heart chakra is caught up and you are spending time in Shri Vishnu’s devotion then how will it benefit you. As a result you will get Vishuddhi problems because its without permission so you will get Vishuddhi Chakra, then Shri Shiva will be upset with you and because you are taking the name of Shri Vishnu so your stomach will also get disturbed. So unnecessarily you will end up on the bed or in the hospital. Then they will say “Mataji, we are very dharmic people and we pray everyday even then we are here in the hospital.” Now here your ignorance is at fault. The biggest thing is that everything can be forgiven. God can forgive anything, everything can be alright if you stabilize yourself on one thing and that is “Shradha” (enlightened faith).

Faith is a very great thing. If you have faith in God innocently without any questions then one day or the other you will definitely get one with God and besides anything wrong done by such person also earns forgiveness. If he thinks about God at that time he will be forgiven because god knows that he is connected to me because of his Indestructible faith. But these days people have no faith and everything has become a fashion/trend. That’s why it takes an opposite form. That’s why man starts to get opposite results. Whatever he tries to do to get some good out of the thing it turns the results completely opposite. Like I told you that all the people from “Hare-Rama Hare-Krishna” have got throat cancer. So many come to me from there and I tell them to open a cancer hospital rahter than an ashram. Now if you tell them they are like we do “Hare Rama Hare-Krishna” why did we get cancer?

So the reason is that you are taking the name of Shri Krishna from your Vishuddhi and you haven’t had any permission from him. You should take his permission. If you just start taking his name morning till evening, then is he your servant? But this understanding comes to you when you get cancer then somebody says Mataji can cure cancer then they come to the line. You will be surprised to know that they are in such bad condition that if I try to ask them any question they just keep on repeating the same words. So likewise by doing any such kind of stupidities one can get many problems. You can see that small thing like electricity which is such a simple power but if you put your finger somewhere then you get a shock so this great tremendous power of the God which is flowing and to have disrespectful and ignorant behaviour can be very dangerous one should know.

That’s why today I am going to tell you each and everything about it. (Unclear text) I am not going to hide anything from you. I am going to tell you each and everything about this power. So later you don’t complain me that Mother you didn’t tell me about it. For this you need to understand, here I told you that its Shri Rama’s place, on the right side. He is on “Rajoguna” as “Maryada Purushotama” on the “Pingala nadi”. Now about him what should one say about him as you know whatever is said in his glory and about him is not enough. But he is (Text-1 embodiment of fatherhood/text-2 embodiment of good conduct and boundaries of good man). Like say, when our this father principle is disturbed then this chakra goes out of order. For if we do not act well towards our father or as father then also it gets affected. Especially when men who run after other women and don’t respect their wives they get this chakra. They get breathing problem. (Asthma) Direct result. If you are catching on your heart to your right means you are against the principle of Shri Rama where he had only one wife. Then you shouldn’t get married.

At the time of wedding you get so super excited and after marriage you think that your wife is worst woman you have ever met. Whatever your wife you should consider her like Lakshmi and should accept her. That’s the principal of Shri Rama of one woman but if you can’t keep to this....I mean if you are having some adjustment problems and all that then we have some treatments in Sahaja yoga to get it right. You can bring the person to the right path but can’t show disrespect to the person. But if you insult that person then it means that you are devoid of this principle of Shri Rama on your right heart. The same way Shri Rama was an ideal king and if some king falls down from his ideal behaviour then also he gets the same chakra. Means he was like father and king should be like that who lives in his boundary. You will ask now that what if a woman becomes characterless then what happens so if that happens then she gets caught up on her left side. Her left of the heart will be caught up and if she gets that means she has become characterless. If she gets her central side caught up then one breast cancer can develop.

When a woman feels that her sense of security has gone bad. When a woman looses her sense of security then she gets breast cancer. If such a situation arises then the solution is to provide security to the woman. Lot of women get Asthma problem, their heart beat goes off the track then also its the same thing that her sense of security is challenged. Like here we have a rule that when new daughter-in-law comes to the house we have to torture her it won’t feel like she has come to her in-laws. As soon as the bride comes to the house we put thousand and one blames on her starting from her great grand fathers and then will go on..saying that your father did this and he was like this and you are like this and you are like that and no good etc. So when things like this start then the girl’s Centre Heart gets caught up and she develops the insecurity. When this insecurity starts to settle in then she develops this catch and due to which she gets breast cancer.

In England and America this disease is way too much because there nor man is stable neither woman is stable. In that imbalanced situation women get this problem because woman in her hearts of heart thinks that they should have a home, their husband should be with them and they live comfortably with their kids. But due to social norms if the situation gets imbalanced then these problems arise. And above that there is this Vishuddhi Chakra that I was telling you about the other day. This Vishuddhi Chakra is constructed or made with with sixteen petals. We have these similar sixteen sub plexuses which are in cervical plexus. Our ears, nose, throat, muscles of our mouth, outside part of our eyes is all governed and taken care by this chakra. Infact when you get sinus problem that is also the result of disturbance in this chakra. It’s two branches go towards our hands as well.

That is why sometimes people get their Realization but they don’t get any feeling on their hands. If that happens then you should get it that you got your Realization but the reason you can’t feel vibrations on your hand is because your Vishuddhi Chakra is disturbed or not alright.

On Vishuddhi Chakra Shri Vishnu becomes the Virata, Virata. Means collective. When a person does not have collectivity in him, he is very self centered, he just thinks about himself and has no thought towards others or society then also this chakra gets caught up. Second thing is tobacco as we are aware of this thing. (Uncear audio). Tobacco is reincarnation of “Putana” (a female demon who came on the earth when Shri Krishna was born) She is always after Shri Krishna. If we take that in any form then this chakra of ours gets caught up. This is the Virata. Virata, the one we call it as “Akbara” that is why muslims call it “Allah-ho-Akbar”. The Akbar Mohammed spoke about was Shri Krishna. He spoke about Krishna, he is the one who takes the form of Virata.

There can’t be any fight of Mohammed and Krishna as one was the guru he was the Viraata. Then you will say then Krishna was greater than him. So tell me in your case, if your eyes are bigger or nose? That your ear is bigger or your mouth? Everyone has their own space their own importance. (Shri Mataji points towards the human chakra chart and describes the Virata). So this Virata..you can imagine this body as Virataa and that the chakras are within the Virata’s body and you all are inside that being as cells. You can call it as Microcosm and Macrocosm. Means that from these small cells this bigger being is created and every cells is a replica of the of the bigger being. When these small cells inside the Virata get this awareness that they are part and parcel of the whole at that moment they get their self realization. You come to the collective consciousness. You can start to feel the chakras say for example of this lady, like where is her attention, where is her Kundalini.

Even small children when they get this blessing of the Virata, of the collective consciousness they can tell, like this girl Pragnya and also my granddaughter who is just two years of age but she can tell you which chakras you are caught up on. Because fingers become sensitive to the feeling of vibrations to this new awareness that this new thing enables to guess where are catching and what it is. It is very important to understand the aspect of Virata. When you consume tobacco then you destroy the Virata within you. The Virata which is within you in the form of collective consciousness, you destroy that. This is such a dirty thing, you see. It such a bad thing that you can estimate it. Once a question was asked, “Why did God create such a thing in this world? So the answer is to kill the insects and bugs it was created. Its an insecticide. God didn’t know this stupid human being will start eating an insecticide. He didn’t know he just made it. What should he do? Then they will ask that why alcohol was created, so it was created just for polishing. It’s only a polish, polish. Somewhere its metal polish, wood polish, sometimes if you want to polish diamonds you can use “jinn” for that. Its only a polish, who told you to drink polish? No God told you this, right? Then why did you start drinking? If tomorrow you start eating soil and may be something even worse than that then what to do? What is God’s fault in it? Or your own mind is at fault? If you drink this polish then you won’t have any hangover but you will drink that which is a bad thing. And I don’t get one thing is when one person goes into drink and he comes out in a (unclear text*) way then those who are watching should run but ten more will go inside. Now see what kind of a brain/intelligence a man has.

One person just came out and fell into a ditch/sewer lane then others should take a lesson from this and should run away from this thing but rather those ten will also inside and get the same kind of hangover to fall in the same ditch/sewer lane. They are like give us also to drink, then they will write poem on it, articles on it, big (unclear text)....that I started talking about alcohol and eight to ten people are ready to go out. (People start to look around then Shri Mataji says...) They didn’t leave yet, didn’t leave yet. (laughter-everyone laughs with Mother) I am giving a prospect that I took this topic of Alcohol and they are ready to leave. (laughter again) So instead should I be saying that son, go ahead and drink as much as you like? Well, there are gurus who do that. They say dear children go ahead and drink, you can smoke tobacco, live your life to destroy it but just hand your purse/wallet over to me. Just this much arrangement for me. Then I don’t have any objections for you to go for gambling, thefts, mafia and even murder people! Keep your purse here. So this much is our relationship that whatever may happen but from your earnings I should be able to get at least sixteenth part of it. (Shri Mataji laughs sarcastically on these gurus) Here at this point on this chakra Shri Krishna is present in his complete form.

A human being comes to this complete form only when he reaches to the state of “Sakshi-swarupa” witness. When this whole world appears to him as a “Leela” a play. Everything is like a play. This can only happen when you become realized. Krishna, apart from this is a great incarnation of diplomacy. Diplomacy of the whole world comes from the lotus feet of Shri Krishna. He was such a diplomat that he has tricked you all for many years. (Unclear text-not sure how to put these words in English) like he gave the theory of “Karma” (action or duties in routine) where you go on doing the duties or karma but leave the fruit of those karmas (work) at the lotus feet of the Divine/God. In second chapter itself Krishna told Arjuna to achieve the highest, to absorb the knowledge, indirectly basically he was told get to the Self-realization.

So Arjuna couldn’t understand the fact and he asked Krishna that one side you tell me to be realized and a witness and on the other side you tell me to go for the war. So Shri Krishna said “I got it...” because he is a diplomat. I will explain you so imagine there is a child playing a bullock cart or horse cart and the horse is behind the cart and the father comes out of his hut and tells him to switch and child does not want to change he wants to continue the same way he is playing. So the father says alright. So attention should be on the horse. A human being is still playing with it. From last six thousand years he is doing the same thing. So many people I have met who tell me that Mataji, I only perform my karmas and the fruit I leave at the lotus feet of God. You will find these kind of self satisfied people a lot. It is not possible. This is diplomacy. What is the essence of diplomacy? Let me tell you the essence of diplomacy which is that put the absurd condition in front. A person will fall trap into his own web.

Now, see the play of the words here where He said that you do your karma and leave the fruit at the feet of God. Its an impossible situation where this is an absurd condition. Now human being is trying to do it like stupid. All right, keep on doing. Unless and until you are (text-1 detached, text-2- broken) until your “karma” becomes “akarma”, until you become empty from within this can’t be achieved because ego and superego are sitting on your head. Whatever you will do it will be either by the force of ego or by superego. So how can you surrender to God unless you have a connection with God. He infact said:-
“Karmanye vadhikaraste phaleshu ma kadachan” (This is 47th sanskrit shloka from second chapter of the Gita, which insists on the importance of doing karma and not getting attached to the result or the fruit as it is in the hands of the Lord.) 

Krishna said this and that too by putting this absurd condition because its not easy to get human beings to the right understanding. I am watching that even after six thousand years the situation is still the same. But I am a Mother so I will say that son, don’t feel bad but bring that horse to the front. Whether you agree or not I can bring that horse in front and put it right. Forcefully I should bring your horse right because from last six thousand years man is trying hard and for how long he would do it? Then in Bhakti yoga also he has shown great diplomacy as again being a diplomat. What to do, can’t do without diplomacy. He said “Pushapam phalam toyam”
(full shloka- Patram pushpam phalam toyam
Yo me bhaktya prayacchati,
Tad Aham bhakty-upahritam
Ashnami prayaytatmanah”)
He said in bhakti yes whatever you will give me- fruits, flowers, leaves anything I will accept that but while giving, I will accept anything that you will give me but notice here you notice the play of his words that it should be given in “Ananya Bhakti” Anaya word is the trick of the play.

I have heard in many lectures where people say to do “Ananya Bhakti” Ananya means there is no one else, when you are one with the divine you become Self-realized then you do the bhakti. Has played on the word “Ananya Bhakti” the all the people are still playing. From last six thousand years no one has been able to understand this part which says that Anaya bhakti means when you get your realization first then go in bhakti. When there is no one else in your bhakti that state comes only when you become realized not before that. The same way he described yoga. But he had been compassionate enough, that’s why his name was “Krishna” means the one who does the “Krishi” (means the farming) he did this farming. The meaning of Krishna is the one who did the krishi (farming). He did the farming part and now I am reaping the fruits or say flowers of those who are ready. He did the farming. He was Krishna. It has been six thousand years no problem, but even now he is present in our throat. When he is awakened in our throat then we can spread our hands toward the Virata and can know that in everyone human being I reside. (unclear text) 

Like there are various types of gems but a same thread runs between or through them the same way when you come on your (Text-1-2 channel/thread/system) the same moment you are also able to go the other’s system as well. This is the thing which is known as collective consciousness. Thanks to the scientists and psychologists, Jung has said that “Next step to awareness is collective consciousness”. (text1- Yung) said that who was the student of Freud. Look at this interesting fact also. He came as a student to Freud and revolted against him and he proved that human beings have collective consciousness in them. To prove his theory they observed the dreams of some people and in that observation he collected this information that everyone who gets a dream gets a (unclear text) symbols and these symbols are the same whether the person is in England, America, India or Timbuktu.

Like say for example someone is going to do a murder then he gets a special type of triangle in his life as image and that the point of that triangle would be positioned towards the downward direction. And if someone is going to get murdered (victim) then he will be getting some image of a triangle where the point of that triangle would be positioned toward the upward direction. Like this they have examined hundreds of dreams and proved that there is some kind of power within us which always gives us a balance, warns us in our dreams. Not only this but it also gives us warnings in symbolic way that this is not all right and that one should not do it. Like so he has done many. He has volumes after volumes of his books, if you get a chance you should read it. Jung was a great Sahaja Yogi but very few people recognized him. He struggled a lot in his life and had to face a lot.

Every wise had to suffer like that no wise man was ever able to get this many good listeners. This is the first time ever that even gods from heaven are happy to see that so many people are listening to Mother. Otherwise, it was hard to get even person and if another one comes the first one will go away. So its like that puzzle in mathematics which says that on a construction once one person came and left the work half done second one came left the work quarter done then when will the work finish? It will never finish if you will have such kind of people. Sahaja Yoga shares the similar story. Maximum people we get are like that. They will come get their self realization, done. Someone will be cured of his disease, then they are like- “ah, Mother cured us”. Then gone. Those who actually stay and get settled in Sahaja are very few. Very Few. There is no end to knowledge as far as Vishuddhi Chakra is concerned. Once you start getting vibrations and slowly start to (text-1visualize/..) and will understand the greatness of Vishuddhi Chakra. Now in this void we have two great entities as well which we know as “Chandra” (moon) and “Surya” (sun). Moon and Sun are such chakras which reside on these “nadis”(channels) here and here (Shri Mataji probably pointing towards the chakra chart and refer) On these chakras there are two very great personalities who have been appointed. They are complete embodiment of human beings. They are like humans in fact are humans.

Out of these one is Buddha and one is Mahavira. But if you listen to the whole history of their lives then these are two sons which Shri Sita had as “Luv and Kush” who is completely in human form. And after they evolved to the level that they are here as Buddha and Mahavira. There also they thought they have reached an extreme of non-violence because the supports of non-violence came in and started protecting even mosquitoes and bugs. Then they again took birth and came at the time of Mohammed. Mohammed was an incarnation of Shri Janaka. (Father of Shri Sita) and his daughter Fatimabai was also incarnation of Shri Sita.

Then as their sons as Hassan and Hussain they gave their life in Karbala to prove that no kind of extreme is good. And this thing is truth or not you can see on your vibrations. If I am lying then through your vibrations you would know that not even one single word is a lie here that I am telling you. And their two positions are here on our head (Shri Mataji probably pointing towards the chakra chart to show their position on head). If your left nabhi is catching then realize that the Mahavira is not alright. If Mahavira position is going alright means that you are very rigid kind of a person. Means starting from morning you will be like can’t eat this, can’t drink that, can’t touch that, can’t do that, need a crisp ironed shirt and all that after shower. Being this kind of a stiff personality gets you Left Nabhi. If you get that then you have to take the names of Shri Mahavira. And your Right Nabhi catches when you become very egoistical. In terms of food, I like that...I like small chopped potatoes with methi. ( a dish in India which is made with greens of fenugreek seed and potatoes) then your Nabhi gets caught up/gone. I like such kind of bathroom. Are you “Aga Khan”? You like the palace of “Aga Khan” then what should we do. So acting in such “tanashahi” way (dictatorship) I didn’t like this thing, I went there and I didn’t like their clothes, I don’t like the saree you are wearing, then you are gone. This is Buddha’s work. In this way, egoistical people get their this chakra caught up. And in this way both sun and the moon channel get caught up. Mahavira has went so deep on the left channel that he has described even what all happens in hell how it happens and what kind of snakes and bugs and insects and smell is there and even then these Jaïns have got no wisdom at all. Not at all they have got any sense. If you read that then you will pull your ears and say “Mother we don’t want to go to hell”. Do whatever else but if this is hell we don’t want this. In fashion you do hundreds of things but keep this in mind that you will go to hell. Someone had this joke I will tell then I will finish my lecture today and then there are two more chakras which we will do tomorrow.
Some gentleman shared this funny story/joke once. That there was a nice dharmic and peaceful person and when he passed away he was brought to God and from there he was directed towards the heaven. He went there and saw that Yogis were meditating there and he saw here also Sahaja Yogis are meditating and i was meditating on earth also. Everyone is just enjoying the meditation and bhajans and all. There is no fun. It has been same for me so there should be fun also and some change. So he requested God that I have heard a lot about Hell, I would like see their fun and what all they do there so please allow me to go to hell. So God said: “Okay you can go this way”. He goes there and see people are having romance, women are dancing, lot of alcohol and cigarette, drama is going on, songs, music, dirty and vulgar conversations are going on and all. Like the scene you have in discotheque. He thought okay yea, this looks good to me. I can enjoy here...So he stood there and someone asked so what are doing here? He replied: ‘I wanted to come to Hell and God has send me here, so I am here to enjoy.” They said: “All right, you take this way and go from that door over there.” So he went. 

As soon as he opened the door he saw people being fried in big, big pots, some were hanging upside down, someone’s throat was being slit, somewhere very weird kind of creatures were crawling upon men and eating them up and people were standing like (unclear text). He got a fright of his life and came out running. He asked what is all that inside? Here you all are enjoying and inside is devastating. They said this is our publicity department of hell. [Shri Mataji laugh]
So get allured with this publicity department. I am telling you, if you don’t trust me read Mahavira, if I am lying. He has explained about all seven kinds of hell. So don’t go the way to hell my child. Now you imagine, i think about it and I feel how should I talk to my children about it.

So if a Mother knows what hell is and she knows about it she would hold her kids tight and would shout that don’t go that way of hell. She can stay hungry and would do anything to stop her kids from going there. You can get this understanding only from those who know about it. I know about it and have seen it that why I am telling you not to go by their publicity department and shouting and requesting you to walk on the right path. By saying this I end my lecture for today its eight-o-clock now and tomorrow we will talk about the next two chakras and will have conversation on Kundalini awakening and what happens with that also about conscious mind and all. So you all come again tomorrow and take notes of my lecture, read it, understand it, and get realized. For Kundalini awakening experience and meditation come in the morning as I work on that part during the day because we don’t have time for that now. Not only that but in morning if I will also cure if someone needs that but for now lecture went on for really long. 

In fact, I wasn’t expecting that but vibrations were very strong. Those who have got cool vibrations on their hands have got their realization. But one has to get established in it, get immersed in it, it is a very subtle happening. For now you are not that subtle. Please note this thing inside the hearts of your hearts that unless and until you know the value of something you can’t desire to attain it. I have made this thing very simple by working hard on it but still you would need to work hard on yourself and make your instrument alright. I can only start your car. With great joy I share with you that with the help of Hindi department after great analysis and work of seven years a book has been printed and released in hindi language. You all should get that book, take home and read it. You will get a lot of knowledge that will help you.

But only book can’t help you either as experience is must. If you haven’t got the experience then everything is a waste. (Seems like some asked Shri Mataji about the price of the book and in response she says) No no there has to be some price. One rupee each? Whatever your shraddha is...Must not be less than a rupee, right? (everyone laughs) No, you should definitely have some price, otherwise I have seen human nature that if you just give them like that then they use it for (unclear) car, its good. Let’s use it. So it shouldn’t be treated like that. It has a great importance. This photo here has got vibrations, that’s why keep it in a proper place and use it in a proper way. From the picture itself thousands have got their self realization in western countries and have got rid of their diseases. That’s why don’t insult the photograph. I am telling you in advance. I am not as simple as I appear. A lot of personalities are sitting within me so don’t try to do anything wrong. One is Shri Hanumana who is standing right there on the door, when you are leaving he will give you all one “paapach”. Go home straight forward, humbly and acting respectfully towards the photograph. I am telling you this. This is the photograph. You all can get it. One rupee is not much anyone. Otherwise if we start distributing for free then its done. Some are standing outside who can get it from there.

[translation version 2]

I have told you about Nabhi Chakra and Void (Bhavasagar). This Void contains our Guru tattwa and Guru tattwa establishes Dharma within us. These 10 petals shown here establishes the Dharma within us. Humans need to have ten Dharmas within them otherwise they are not humans. Even if they have nine dharmas established, still somewhat they are lacking. And by Dharma, I absolutely do not mean Christians, Hindus, Muslims, etc. But, if humans do not take care of the 10 dharmas of humanity within them, then they become demons.

This Guru tattwa has taken several births on this planet. Specifically, there have been 10 main births. Raja Janak, Nanak, Muhammad Saab, etc. and lastly Sainath of Shirdi took birth. We tie these tattwas because even inside of us, all those great personalities who have taken births for our evolution are also tied inside of us. Humans are also tied to several things. It is very subtle. Like gods these gurus are present in our void. Now, first & foremost, they have told not to drink. They weren’t bit by some mad dog, nor were they fighting elections, neither did they have other businesses that due to competition, they told drinking was bad. They told, son, do not drink, do not smoke, don’t take any brew, because, in our stomach resides our Chitta (attention), specifically, in our liver. They told not to drink so that you do not bring impurities into your stomach and ruin your attention. Drinking alcohol drowns your consciousness. Now, people got a different meaning of this. To take care of their stomachs, they put too much attention on food. They started not eating garlic, onions, this, that, etc. etc. Now, Muhammad Saab (Sahab) used to eat garlic & onion. Even Nanak used to eat even ghost (goat or lamb) etc. everything.

Meaning, we are not to put too much attention on eating & drinking. We should not waste our attention on these things. What to eat in the morning, what to eat in the evening, what to eat now, what to eat tomorrow, etc. I went to Paris. I was astonished at the people there. I thought no one in the world is more foody than them. If they call you for lunch, for more than an hour it is investigated what to order. This specification, that specification. Now, I find all the taste same. They’ll make us work so hard to decide on the food menu, for an hour, and they’ll keep drinking alcohol for an hour, then god knows what they like so much about it. Afterwards, they’ll discuss each item, each ingredient in so much details. They give very specific orders. Hence, the waiters there are considered experts. They’ll get exactly what you tell them. So much specifications, and finally the taste is of no use. One hour a person has wasted in this – what to order. Today, I want this, tomorrow that, day after this!!

Now, in our country (India), there is this disease of fasting. Now even before fasting, people start thinking what kind of ‘food’ should we prepare. Only particular type of flour should be used, etc. Now lets go and shop for that. We have this thing about Friday – Goddess Santoshi Ma’s fast. We must never do fasting on that day. Who told to fast on the very day she was born. Now, these affairs of the Brahmins, what to say. Some are sitting here, they’ll break my head! (lauging) What common sense is this to fast on someone’s birthday. The day Shri Ganesh, Santoshi Ma are born, they say to fast, not eat sour food. The thing she likes, they say don’t eat that. What sense is this! This not going to make them happy. Surely, the negative tantriks do these things, whatever mother doesn’t like, do that. I will say simply, I don’t like any fasting done by my children. Don’t fast. If you don’t feel like eating someday, that’s allright. Just eat fruits. But no need for anyone to fast in Sahaja Yoga. I don’t need TB patients here.

They make such sickly pictures of Christ, like some TB patient. Thin arms, legs. How can Christ be like this. Think a bit. How can a great godly person look like that. He was a shining, bright, flower like, heartfelt person. He could take down 10 people on his own. Now, these evil French artists, have made Christ’s depiction like this. Atleast, in our country (India), you’ll never see such a depiction of Ramchandra ji (Shri Rama). Shri Rama & Sita ji will be healthy, round figured and beautiful. Not like these sickly depictions of Christ. How can sickly people help others. No need for these dramas. Now, Gandhiji did Satyagraha for all of us. You all do not need to fast. Mother doesn’t get happy by all this. Now this does not mean keep eating (laughing). Humans go to extremes. They’ll say Mother told to eat. Next you see, they are coming with such huge bellies. Now, they’ll say, Mother please give treatment for my stomach.

Don’t eat too much or too less. Be in the middle. Be prudent. In general, don’t put much thought to food. Simple, vibrated, good food, made by Griha Lakshmi, i.e. dharmic food should be eaten. I am not taking about veg and non veg. Now here also, people have gone to such extremes. Jains have done such extremism of vegetarianism that I don’t know what explanation to give now. They keep a brahmin in one room and fill it with insects. The insects bite the brahmin and the brahmin gets good money for this. Now, is this vegetarianism. Am I to give realization to insects or chicken? I have to give realization to humans. What will you do saving chickens! No need for such charity. Do normal good behavior.

Now, there are even more dangerous situations. Like in Denmark, there was a Lamha. He said, I only walk on marble. I am vegetarian, you all have to be vegetarian. Now there aren’t many vegetables available in Demark. Other than few like potatoes, there aren’t much options. They all become unhealthy & sickly. And the Lamha ji kept eating a lot. I asked, what did he tell you about sex. Lamha ji told them, that’s your culture, do whatever you want. Finally, two girls came from there and told me, we got pregnant. This is their vegetarianism. Now, whenever you remove a person from their normal diet, they become weak. Then, it gets easier to put bhoots in them.

Ram Chandra ji was a Kshatriya. He used to eat everything. For whom did he kill the deer.

Now, the limits that Jains have done, they say Krishna is not god. Why? Beacause, he killed Rakshasas. Now, if Shri Krishna doesn’t destroy Rakshas, who will. Will these Jains do it! Should we not destroy Rakshasas. Is that violence! Violence also has dharma. The destruction which is for the good, have to be done. Anger is also necessary. If you do not get angry, sometimes, bhoots don’t go. We have to get angry and say – go away. Then they run off. If it understands anger only, we must get angry. If we say to bhoots – ‘please leave his body, I’m totally non violent, please go’, (laughing), the bhoot will come and sit on you too. Where scolding is necessary, it has to be done. Earlier, people used to beat with broomsticks. No need to do that. But, sometimes you have to scold. You have to scold and say ‘go away, if you don’t go away, I’ll curse you’, then they run off. It’s worth observing these things (how these bhoots behave).

Now this saying ‘Don’t get angry’ is very interesting. In Mumbai, there was a program. Many people were there. This bhoot ridden person came to me. Got very angry. Tore off my books. Threw them at me. Gave me ten slangs. Some Sahaja Yogis present there got angry. They said you cannot speak to Mother like this. He says, you are Yogis, you should not get angry, you sit quietly. I told him off. Give him two slaps now. If necessary, call the police. He immediately ran off.

Gone are the days when saints were tortured. Now, beware, if anyone tries to harm sadhus & saints, they will be destroyed. All evil eyes towards sadhus & saints will be made blind. Otherwise, they’ll not learn. Who gave humans the right to trick saints all the time. This is a new era. Enough is enough. All secrets and evil will be removed. All adharmics will be punished. No one has the right to trick sadhus and saints anymore. Earlier, it was said, you’ll get bad karma if you trick saints. Now, that bad karma needs to be visible that instant. We have tricked saints too much.

This is due to adharma. When there is adharma in the Nabhi, when Nabhi is totally filled with adharma, then Shri Vishnu ji takes incarnation. He has come in many forms. He has come even in female form. He comes for the protection of Sadhus & Saints. And at that time, Shri Durga ji, Jagadamba, comes to the center heart. She has taken several births. It is said she took 1000 births. She has taken several partial incarnations as well. And she protects the tattwa after coming to earth. She protects the qualities of the tattwa. After that protection, when humans rise to the center heart, it is the place of Jagadamba; Jagadamba then resides in your heart.

Hearth Charkra is in between. Heart is on the left. That is Shri Shiva’s place. That which is called the spirit, resides there. If anyone says, I got a heart attack, then I tell him to ask for forgiveness from God Almighty. You tell him –

‘O Ocean of forgiveness, please forgive me. Whatever mistakes I have committed, by any means, please forgive me.

Kara-charana kṛitam vā kāya-jam karma-jam vā

(Please forgive all our wrong deeds that have been done by our hands

or feet, or created by the body),

Shravana nayana-jam vā mānasam v’āparādham

(By our ears or our eyes, with our minds or through our mistakes.)

Vihitam-avihitam vā sarvam-etat kshamasva

(For all that has been done or left undone, please forgive us.)

Jaya jaya Karun’ābdhe Shrī Mahā-deva Shambho

(Victory to You, again and again! O ocean of compassion,

O great and benificent God!)’

This is the mantra. If his heart doesn’t get allright, I am ready to lose whatever you say. But, the person must be a realized soul because he has developed the connection with God Almighty. And if he (realized soul) asks for forgiveness, he is forgiven because Shri Shiva is ‘Bhole Shankar’ (Innocent). But, connection must be there.

On the contrary, if you are Shri Shiva’s devotee, you’ll get heart attack. Yes, absolutely. Why? Because, without his permission, ... (you are taking his name)

If you have to meet the prime minister, you have to write so many letters to so many people. But Shivji, Shivji is the grand father of the grand father (huge personality). He is a very big deal. His name should never be taken casually. See, who all sit with him. You will be reprimanded by the Ganas if you take Shri Shiva’s name carelessly. Without realization, never ever take Shivji’s name. After realization, with extreme humility, your head bowed, asking for forgiveness, you should take Shri Shiva’s name. A lot of humility is required, if you wish to take Shri Shiva’s name. And he likes only humility and because of this humility even several big Rakshasas have got him. You have to be very humble. Always accept your faults and with humility be at the feet of Shri Shiva. This makes him happy.

(scolds a Yogi in Marathi for clicking pictures. Says no special ‘roop’ is going to come while giving lecture. Not to disturb)

OK, now Shri Shiva’s place is left heart. He resides as the image of God (Spirit). Keeps burning like a luminous flame. He knows everything, whatever is happening or not happening within you, like a field expert. Don’t make any mistakes in front of this Lord. And if you make a mistake, definitely ask for forgiveness otherwise instantaneously your heart will get caught. Remember your mistakes, if you can’t remember just say ‘Lord, forgive me for any mistakes I made.’ Without him forgiving, heart cannot clear.

Any kind of extreme behavior annoys him. That is why, I say not to do Hatha Yoga. Definitely, you’ll get heart attack. Only asanas is not Hatha Yoga. There are six things in this. There has to be rules. Only brahmacharis (celibate) should do Hatha Yoga, that too in jungles, before the age of 25 Hatha Yoga practices should be completed under a guru. You should commit what you do to the Lord. Nowhere it is written in Patanjali that a householder should do Hatha Yoga practices. Nowhere. Among that, Pranayam, Vyayayam, Asanas, etc. are very small part. Among Asanas also you should know, which chakras have problems and accordingly what Asanas you should do. Now, suppose you have stomach upset and you are doing Asana for the throat. Throat will be damaged along with stomach. There is science behind what to do where, which mantra to be taken where. If your heart is caught and you are doing bhakti of Shri Vishnu, what is the use! One – your Vishuddhi will get caught because without permission you are taking mantras, Two – Shri Shiva will be upset, Three – you are taking Shri Vishnu’s name, hence you’ll upset your stomach as well. You’ll get bed ridden or will have to be hospitalized. Then you’ll say, we are so Dharmic, we do so many rituals every day and we are in the hospital. Here, the fault is of your ignorance. Biggest thing is, the Almighty forgives all of these, everything can be forgiven if you are determined about one thing – intense reverence. Respect/reverence is a huge thing. If you have innocent faith and respect towards God Almighty, there is no questioning, you will find God sometime or the other. And even if he does any mistakes, it can be forgiven. Whenever he remembers God he becomes kshamya (excusable) because God knows his devotion but nowadays, there are no such devotees, people are more into fashion.

So, the person becomes the opposite of a devotee. Whatever one tries to do, opposite outcome occurs. For example, I told you about Hare Rama Hare Krishna people who get throat cancer. So, many of them have come to me. I told them instead of an ashram, you people open a cancer hospital. Now, they wonder why we are getting cancer as we are praising Rama and Krishna ( Hare Rama Hare Krishna ). They should understand that without permission they are taking Krishna’s name, they should take his permission first. These people from morning to evening started reciting his name. Krishna isn’t their servant but then they only understand when they get cancer and then they get to Mother cures cancer and then they come to me.

You will be surprised that if I ask anything from these people they still go on reciting those words (Hare Rama, Hare Krishna). So, by doing such stupidity one can suffer so much. Now, you can take the power of electricity if you put your finger into it you will get a shock, the same way the highest power of God is flowing. Disrespect or ignorance towards that power can be dangerous and that is why I am going to tell you each and everything out this shakti, nothing I am going to hide. I will tell you about this param shakti ( Power of God ) to you then don’t say that I didn’t tell you. You need to understand it.

Now, I told you that this chakra is of Shri Rama on the right side and he was a maryada purushotama (the supreme among men upholding the auspicious/righteous boundaries). He is sitting on Rajoguna ( pingala nadi – right channel) . Whatever I say is always so little because there is too much to tell about him. But he represents fatherhood as he is the father. So, whenever the fatherhood is challenged then this also gets disturbed. Especially, when a man runs after women and doesn’t respect his wife they get a catch here. They get Asthma. If your right side is catching then you are against Shri Rama who was devoted to his wife. Either you don’t get married but the time you get married you are excited but after marriage if you are not dharmic ( righteous ) and you feel that your wife is the most horrible woman, however your wife is she is the Lakshmi and you should accept her as your Laksmi swaroopa (embodiment ). This is the quality of Shri Rama – being devoted towards his wife. If you don’t get along with your wife at all then in Sahaja Yoga they can get better. You can show them the right path but you cannot disrespect them, you cannot disrespect the essence of wifehood. If you disrespect them then the virtues of Shri Rama you don’t get. In the same way, Shri Rama was an ideal king and once a king or ruler isn’t ideal then this right heart gets caught up. He was like a father who is a king and a king should be in his maryada ( limits or auspicious boundaries ).

So now if you ask what happens when a woman becomes adulterous then her left side catches (where Mahakali principle resides ). When her center heart catches then she can get breast cancer. She feels her sense of security has been affected. The solution is to get a sense of security. Many women get Asthma or heartbeat problems; it means their sense of security is affected. Here in India, when a bride comes to her in-laws house, unless and until she isn’t totally worked up she is not a bride. There will be thousands of rules for her and they start accusing her of what her parents and family have done. The woman can get a catch of center heart where her sense of security is. In England and in America, this problem is to a great extent because no man or woman are answerable. In rule less system, women get this disease quite often. A woman in her being feels she should have her own husband, children and a good household  but if that doesn’t happen  due to societal conditionings, then this problem arises, her sense of security is affected.

Above this is Vishuddhi Chakra, it is a very important chakra. This Vishuddhi chakra is made of 16 petals and these are in our cervical plexus. This controls throat, nose, part of eyes, facial muscles, ears and even the problem of the sinus glands which you get due to imbalance of this Vishuddhi chakra. It’s two branches go towards our hands. Therefore, sometimes people get their self realization but don’t feel vibrations due to imbalance of this Vishuddhi chakra.

On Vishuddhi chakra, Shri Vishnu becomes Virata, meaning collective. When human being is not collective but is self centered, he doesn’t think of the society or others then this chakra catches. Now, another thing is tobacco in any form taken then this chakra catches. Tobacco is the avatar of Puthana (female demon) who is always after Shri Krishna. Virata who we call as Akbar, that is why muslims say “ Allah Ho Akbar “. The Akbar prophet Mohammad spoke about was Shri Krishna. Prophet Mohammad and Shri Krishna can never be separate because prophet Mohammad was the Guru principle and Shri Krishna is Virata principle. Then you will say one is greater but is the ear bigger or nose? Every deity has its own working and position and all are important.

You can see this subtle system chart, it represents Virata and Virata has the same chakras and channels and you all represent each cell within him. You can say it as microcosm and macrocosm. From all these small – small cells, a big cell is made. When these small cells get enlightened who is an image of this big cell that is the Virata, then realization is done. Then you are part of a collective consciousness. You can feel another person can tell which chakra is catching till where the Kundalini has risen in another person. Even small children when  they get realization can tell, for example, my granddaughter PrAgnya, who is 2 years old can also tell what chakras you are catching because you can feel it in your fingertips, a new awareness is established. One needs to understand the Virata principle.

When you eat tobacco you end this Virata principle within you. So, you tell how horrible this tobacco is. Now one can ask why God has made tobacco ? It is made to kill pests – it is an insecticide but God didn’t know that foolish human beings will start consuming it. Now, one can ask why God made alcohol ? It is made for polishing, for example, wood polishing, and if you want to polish diamonds you can do so with gin. Who told you to consume a polish ? God didn’t tell you right ? Then why did you start drinking it?

If tomorrow you start eating mud or start doing worse then what can I say ? What is God’s fault in this ? It is the mind’s fault. If you don’t drink this polish you can never be intoxicated. Another thing I don’t understand is that, if one person drinks and is intoxicated and starts shouting then others should see this and run away from that person instead 10 more people go into it. I don’t know what brain human beings have! One man came and fell into gutters, humans should run away seeing this but instead they go there and drink. Then they write poems and stories. Once I started talking against alcohol, 8-10 people got up and started leaving the hall. Not now.. not now.. [laughter] but sometime ago. So, shall I say beta ( child ) drink a lot? Of course, There are many false gurus who will tell you to go ahead and drink and take tobacco and finish your life but just give your wallet to me. They don’t care if you murder people or rob people or do smuggling but they just want your wallet. Their and their guru’s relationship is just that his earning’s 1/16th part should go to the guru.

On Vishuddhi, Shri Krishna is in his complete form. Humans also get to that complete form when he reaches to witness state. The whole world seems to be like a drama to him. This can only happen when you are realized. Krishna is also an avatar of diplomacy. Whole world’s  diplomacy  comes out of his lotus feet. He was such a big diplomat that he fooled you since so many years because he knew that if spoken straightforwardly; they are in any case going to kill (hit) Mataji; but he is not a Mother(Mataji); he is Father figure (pitaji) and he said beta ( child ) keep on going on like this. If you keep on going like this it is fine. When you bang your head then you will come to the right direction. The way he spoke about karma, that you do your karma without expectation or you leave results to God. In the second chapter of Gita he told Arjuna that you should get your self realization. So, Arjuna said, on one side you are telling me to get self realization and on one side you are telling me to participate in war ? So, he said okay I understood. So, Krishna is a diplomat. So, you can think of it as, for instance, there is a child and he is standing with a bullock cart and the horse is at the back. So, his father came out of his hut and told him to move the horse in the front but the boy said no I will keep it here. The father said ok but keep your attention on the horse. Now, the boy is keeping the horses at the back and it has been 6 thousand years the horses are still there. Same way humans come and say Mother I do my karma but the result I leave it to God but it is not possible for you to do that. This is the diplomacy.

I will tell you the principle of the diplomacy that put absurd conditions on the person and then the person will get into his own circumstance. Just see the drama of his ( Shri Krishna )  words that keep on doing karmas and leave it to God. It is not possible! Now human beings keep on going like this but till the time your karma doesn’t become Akarma it is not possible because you have ego and superego. Whatever you will do, either you will do with ego or superego then how will you surrender it to God until and unless you don’t have the connection  ( union ) with God till then how is it possible? He has just put you in an absurd situation because humans cannot understand otherwise. It has been 6 thousand years and humans are still the same but I am a Mother and I say child don’t feel bad but put your horse in front. Even if you feel bad I can bring the horse and put it in front (only then will the cart move). I will bring it forcibly because you have been trying for 6 thousand years and still you are trying. Again in bhakti yoga, he has again shown great diplomacy. He said, whatever you give me, a flower or a fruit, see the whole play of his words, I will accept the offering but it should be ananya bhakti. Ananya means when there is no other! It is when you become one with God, when you get your self realization. Just by one word ‘Ananya’ he played you. It has been 6 thousand years humans could not understand it. It means first get your self realization and then do your bhakti (devotion). When there is no other, this state you only achieve when you get your self realization.

Having said that, he (Shri Krishna) has been very gracious. He did the (Krishi) cultivation. That is why his name was Krishna, he did his krishi (cultivation). Krishna means the one who sows. He is the one who sowed (the seeds), now I am the one who is reaping them...lifting up all the flowers and fruits that have emerged, but He is the one who sowed the seeds. He was here 6000 years ago, still He is situated in our throat. When He awakens in the throat, we can spread our hands towards the Virata and then we can know that I am present in each and every human being.

Just like there are many gems but through it only one thread runs, just like that when you come on your own thread then you are able to go on other peoples’ (common) thread as well. This is what is known as the collective consciousness. And there is a lot of gratitude we owe to scientists and psychologists like Jung, who has said that the next step to awareness is collective consciousness. In human beings, collective consciousness, samuhik chetna, will be established...this is what Jung has said. Jung came as the disciple of Freud who was like a Rakshasa. Look at how incredible that is as well, he came as the disciple of Freud, revolted against him and proved that there is collective consciousness in human beings and he also gave many proofs for it by looking at many people’s dreams. And through the dreams he was able to find out that in each dream there are certain symbols that appear. And they appear in every person in the same way, whether that person be in England or America or India or Timbuktu.

Take for example a person who is going to murder someone. Then in front of him a unique symbol of a  triangle always keeps appearing in his life and it (the peak of the triangle) is pointed downwards. And if someone is about to get murdered, then the triangle appears pointed upward. He found out about thousands of dreams and through that he proved that within us there is a power that always tries to bring moderation in us, and through symbols it gives us warnings that this is a wrong thing, don’t do it. He’s analyzed many like these, and there are volumes on volumes he has written. You should read them and learn. Jung is a very great Sahaja Yogi and in his life, he had a lot of struggles. Very few people agreed with him and he had a lot of disasters looming on him. Every benevolent person had to encounter such disasters. No benevolent man actually even got this much recognition. This is the first time even the deities are happy that so many people are listening to what Mother is saying. Before even one man was hard to find. If you used to find one, then once you found another, one of them used to run away. It’s like that math problem where the question goes... one man comes to work, does half of it and then leaves. Then another man comes, he does one-fourth of the work, then leaves. So when will the work finish? Will it even ever get done or not? If you bring such runaways, then the work will never get done. This is like Sahaja yoga, mostly all these people who always run away show up. If their diseases get fixed, then well and good. “Yes Mother has fixed us up, now we are done.” There are very few, very few that show up who establish beyond that point.

Whatever is spoken about the vishuddhi is not enough, there is no end to it. When the vibrations start coming to you, you’ll slowly begin to realize more about the Vishuddhi and you’ll understand the significance of it. In the bhavasagar (Void), there are two other beings who are very important who we can know and understand as Chandra and Surya. They are such chakras that are settled on these two nadis (this and this...). On top of these chakras, two very huge personalities have been placed. They are the embodiment of human beings, they are human beings. One of them is Buddha, the other is Mahavira. But, if you listen to their entire history then they are Sita ji’s sons, Luv and Kush, who are just humans. And after that, they kept climbing higher and higher and reached a point where they became Buddha and Mahavira. Even then they thought they reached an extreme of non-violence because their non-violent followers and supporters started saving mosquitoes and beetles in the name of non-violence. Then they had to incarnate with Mohamed Sahib, because Mohamed Sahib was himself the incarnation of Shri Janaka. And his daughter, Shri Fatima, was herself Shri Sita, the Adi Shakti. And they (Buddha and Mahavira) arrived as Shri Fatima’s sons Hasan and Husein and sacrificed their lives at the battle of Karbala. To prove this that no extreme is right. And you can check this is true or not depending on your vibrations. If I am lying then your vibrations will tell you so. Not a single alphabet that I am speaking to you is a lie.

Both their places are here on our head. When your left nabhi catches, then know that Shri Mahavira’s place is spoiled. And when Shri Mahavira’s place is ruined, it means that you are a very stubborn person. “I don’t want to eat this, I don’t want to eat that, I don’t want to touch that, I don’t want to do that”....shower right in the morning and only wear the clothes that are ironed. Being a stiff person like this will make your left nabhi catch and for that, then you have to take the name of Shri Mahavira. For right nabhi, it catches when you become too egotistical. For example, in the matter of food you say things like “I only like this, I only like vegetables prepared with small potatoes with cut up fenugreek leaves inside it.” Then your nabhi catches. “I only like the bathroom to be this way”. I mean, are you Aga Khan? You like Aga Khan’s palace so what can we do about that? To do this where you say things like “I did not like this thing. I went there and I did not like their clothes. You wore this saree and I did not like it” then you are gone. This is the state of the Buddha principle. This is how egotistical people catch here (ego). Like this, the nadis of Moon and Sun get caught up.

Shri Mahavira did the work on the moon channel. He went into Hell and figured out what happens there, what types of 7 hells are there, the types of critters there are and how it stinks up...he has described that completely. However, even then the Jains don’t have any sense, no sense entered into them. If you ever read what he wrote, you will hold your ears and say ”Mother, we do not want to go to hell. If this is hell then we don’t want it”. In fashion, you end up doing thousands of things but know that you will end up going to hell. Right now someone told a good joke, and I’ll tell you that and wrap up my lecture. There are two other chakras left and we will talk about those tomorrow. One joke someone told was that there was a man who was very dharmic and sattvik (pure), a poor man who lived a very peaceful life. And when he went to heaven he saw that there are many Sahaja Yogis there doing dhyan (meditation). So the man said, I lived a life just like this on earth and now the same thing is here in heaven. I thought it would be a lot of fun in heaven but here everyone is only just meditating. There should be something else beyond this. So he told God, “God I want to go to hell and see what type of thing hell is so I know what it is like.” So God said “Okay son, feel free to go using this way”. So when he got to hell, he saw there is unrestrained merrymaking happening, women are dancing, music is playing, people are talking in a dirty manner, alcohol and cigarettes are going around. Just like here it happens, what are they called? I am forgetting [audience: discotheque] discotheque yes! He saw discotheques are open there so he exclaimed “wow, yesI am finally here!” So the people there asked him, “why are you standing here?” He said “I wanted to go to hell so God has sent me here.” The other person said” okay here is the door, go in through that.” The moment the door opened up, he saw people being cooked in vessels, people getting burned, being hung upside down, their necks being cut, weird critters crawling over them and eating them. He came running out and said, “what is this? You guys are doing all that outside but inside this is happening”.  The man said, “what is outside is the publicity department of hell.” [laughter]

So don’t get carried away by the publicity department, I am telling you. If you don’t believe me then you can read what Mahavira has written. If you think I am lying and you don’t believe me, then read it and see for yourself what the 7 hells are like. So don’t go towards hell, my dear. It is very horrible. I keep thinking and thinking how do I even talk about this, these are my children. Think about this, if a mother knows what hell is like then she will shout and scream and keep holding on to her child and say “my child, don’t go there”. She will even die hungry but will keep telling you that “no matter what happens, don’t go there because I know what it is like.”

And you can only understand this from the one who knows. Why I keep shouting and screaming and pleading again and again that my children keep on the right path because I have seen hell, don’t get carried away by its publicity department. With this said, I will conclude today’s lecture because it is 8 pm and it’s late. Tomorrow we will talk about the other two chakras and general talks around what happens from the Kundalini awakening and the conscious mind. Tomorrow come and note all the lectures, think over it and understand it and establish your realization. I do the work of Kundalini awakening in the morning, for realization and meditation you should come in the morning. Because right now there is no time for it. Not only this, in the morning if there is something of yours to cure, I will do that as well. But for now, the lecture has become quite long, I was not expecting that but there were so many vibrations. Those who are feeling cool, they should know they have got their realization. But this needs to be established and imbibed. This is a very subtle truth however you are not so subtle yet. Please keep this in your heart and know that nothing can be obtained till you start valuing it. I have made this entire thing very easy and straightforward after working on it quite a lot. Even then, it can be twisted if you yourself are a twisted person. Fix yourself and fix your instrument. I can only turn on your car.

It is a great moment of happiness that after seven years, through the aid of hindi speakers, a small book in Hindi was published. This book has now arrived, please take this book and take it home, read it and understand it. You will know a lot through it. But just through a book it wont work out, you have to experience it. If you haven’t experienced it, it’s all waste for you.

No no the book definitely has a price. The price is 1 rupee. Keep the price of the book as 1 rupee. Whatever faith you have, it won’t be less than 1 rupee right? 1 rupee. [laughter] You have to charge something for it. The reason for this is human beings’ behaviour is such that if you just give it to them for free, they will think this to be as good as garbage.

This has a lot of value, there are a lot of vibrations coming from the photograph. Keep it in a respectful place and use it with respect. Due to this photo, thousands have gotten their realization and have received wholesome health and a disease free state. So don’t dishonour this photograph, I am telling you this right now. I may look very naive but I am not. And there are many (deities) sitting inside of Me, who are sitting here and watching you. That’s why you should not do anything wrong. Hanuman ji is standing at the door, so if you misbehave he will give you a nice hit. That’s why you should leave with politeness and with peace. This is the photo, everyone should come and get it. It is only one rupee, and that is not a lot for anyone so come get it. If we start distributing it for free then it may be so...(incoherent)
