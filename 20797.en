She listed everyone's names! She showed so many dimensions in that. She knows yantra vidya, tantra vidya, yagya vidya, spiritual knowledge—all the knowledge of the goddesses, she told all their qualities. Now, not a single one of these qualities is found in these gurus. Not even one. Except economics—these so-called 'modern gurus' know nothing else. [Shri Mataji laughs]

Sahaja Yogi:  Mother, how do these people even last for a while?

Shri Mataji: Don’t know, it’s actually you people who keep them going! they’re basically pickpockets if you look at it, but you’re the ones who keep them going, what can I do, I really have no idea.

Sahaja Yogi: Lakhs of people flock to them.

Shri Mataji: Yes, literally lakhs! [laughing] There was one who recently came—who would make everyone jump, but couldn’t make anyone jump in Delhi. I said, you know, when a jackal’s death is near, it heads towards the city. I said he’s come right into the city now, let him jump if he wants, he’s collected crores of rupees.

Shri Mataji: Hmm, alright, now let’s hear it.

Sahaja Yogi: I have written a welcome song for the new year.

Shri Mataji: Well, he has become a ‘sidra’ poet. I see he is a great ‘sidra’ poet.

Sahaja Yogi: I am not writing anything but you are making me write.

Shri Mataji: Well, keep writing.

(Sahaja Yogis sing bhajans — 'Jagmag karta hai sansar...')

Shri Mataji: Wah, that’s wonderful! please call Mrs. Venu Gopalan forward too, she’s a great singer! Yes, come forward. There are really amazing singers here. So many talented ones are sitting here. You too sing, but let her sing first then you sing. Hmm. Yes, "the thing is, he is a composer, a composer and a singer working from his heart—he just makes the whole thing, you see, vibrate, that's the main thing.

Black One, you sing on that, yes, that's the first, Black one [on harmonium]. Now you got it."

(Sahaja Yogis sing ‘Lambodaraya’ and ‘Jai Jai Bhawani, Jai Jai Shivani’.)

Shri Mataji: May God bless you, may God bless you.

(Sahaja Yogis sing qawwali ‘Hriday Anand Hai Chhaya Pujya Mataji Aayi Hain’.)

Shri Mataji: Wonderful, absolutely wonderful.

(Sahaja Yogis do ‘Jaikaar’)

Shri Mataji: You’ve done an amazing job.

Sahaja Yogi: Jaikaar is very short. Lets do Punjabi Jaikaar [everyone laughs with Mother]

(All Sahaja Yogis do loud and long Jaikaar)

"Now it's long. But there’s a thing—clapping opens the Sahasrara, feel on your hands, because the whole Sahasrara is here. You’ll see, the vibrations have improved instantly, that’s the specialty of clapping—instantly the Sahasrara opens up. Sahasrara is in your hands and feet too but when you clap here, you’re actually hitting your chakras. Clapping hits the chakras, so immediately the Sahasrara opens up. Especially for the Void—if you have Void problems, or issues from fake gurus, this is especially good, sing qawwali by clapping hands harder. The early qawwals only sang the praise of God, like bhajans. But now, even the form of qawwali has changed—originally, women did not sing qawwali, and when they did it was always in a group, but nowadays the form has gotten distorted. This isn’t the true qawwali. Amir Khusro brought this tradition, he was a disciple of the saint Nizamuddin. He put all these poems into everyday language, in regular life, like ‘Babul Mera Naihar Chhooto Jaye’—all written by him. So, in daily songs, weddings, everything, he expressed the praise of God in such a style you wouldn’t notice, but people were really praising God in a symbolic way. It’s very beautiful. He started the idea that singing with a beat would help—original qawwalis happened at the saint’s shrine, then at Chisti’s place, then everywhere. A very famous qawwal came recently, his name’s Nusrat Hussain Sahib, from Pakistan. As soon as he saw me, he said, ‘Mother, you, here, please sit at the front.’ So he sat me in the front and started singing, saying, ‘Today the color has come, because you’re sitting here.’ He didn’t know me, nothing, but he is one of the true followers. Now, the shrine of Nizamuddin is still here, but now even there people go to earn money. Originally it wasn’t like that. I told someone that Nizam Saab was a realised soul so people started going and money started flowing. His relatives now just sit there collecting money. Sitting at the door, just collecting money—could collect something else but are stuck on this! Chisti’s place too, all these were saints, what we call ‘peer’ or realized souls—they’re all the same, no difference, it’s we who argue needlessly. Let them fight, the more heads break, the better—they’ll learn eventually. Then everyone will come to their senses."

Sahaja Yogi: The same thing is happening in Punjab.

Shri Mataji: They’re just foolish, what to say—Nanak Sahib, Prophet Mohammad, they were all the same. Mohammad Sahib saw people fighting among themselves, so he came back as Nanak Sahib. He worked so hard, did everything, and now see what drama people have created. They’ll see sense. People need to see fanaticism up close to realize; Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs all need to see what real stupidity is. Only when they see will they understand. Otherwise, the demon remains hidden. That’s why now it’s right in front—showing what utter foolishness is happening in the name of religion, where have we reached? This is what religion is? Is this God? The one who has compassion, the Lord who is Raheem, who is Rama, how can He be like this? Where is Nanak Sahib, and where are these people - there is no comparison. Even among Hindus there’s a lot of cruelty; I criticized the Brahmins so heavily, I didn’t know I was sitting in their stronghold, I criticized them that you have created such ugly images of God for earning money; but now they have begun to change. There’s an impact. We will have to speak up; otherwise, how will true religion be established? Now, with the establishment of Vishwa Dharma, all others will dissolve into it, because what goes on in the name of religion is just irreligion—giving the Lord a bad name. That’s why so many have lost faith in God. The same happened in Algeria—people noticed that these fundamentalists were so violent, Iraq fought Iran, killing each other, so some turned to communism. Five hundred of them came towards communism; one encountered us in London. He said 'God is real, communism is false, let us not fear the fundamentalists, let us stand on our own,' so five hundred received realisation, they came by flight and got their realisation. This will happen. Many Sikhs—even in Birmingham, so many complaints—now they come to us. Minds will change, people will realize: what is this, why are people jumping into the ocean. When the talk is about God then we must rise towards the sky, where they are jumping into the ocean? Fighting among themselves, what drama is this, just see where they are proceeding, especially rest other Sikhs like those in Maharashtra and all, they are scared that they will beat us also now. Let them learn, they have become very fanatic, everyone has to learn. Everything will be alright, let them go though these fights for sometime. No one is going to die—don’t worry about that. It’s important that these events show the world what is happening. I read in the news paper that a Sikh was caught and he said that all these Sikhs do smuggling of drugs so to catch them I do these things. Now he is caught, let's see. Now, those who talk about God, talk about temples, talk about mosques, what do they have to do with smuggling? See the contrast: one is darkness, one is light—how can they mix? And yet, people accept such situations. There are big popes and the mafia—they’re all one. And they have the same bank, Switzerland ones, they are all big thieves, they are sitting on stolen money from all over the world. You will be surprised that they were caught right in front of the place where my program was held in calvinist church, three of them. Mafia, Pope and Swiss banks all are big thieves. All are getting exposed now. It's a good thing all should get exposed and finish off with it. What are these Swiss banks? They have money collected from all thieves around the world and they go around wearing Red Cross badges, all thieves. Can such people be accepted as spiritual? But you have to see, they’ve organized everywhere, and who are these people? Masonic lodge, secretive thieves—decided if they're going to steal, why not do it big, set up Swiss banks through such secretive means.

In a world like this, to establish Sahaja Yoga, we must stand with courage, build a strong foundation, and above all, stop fighting among ourselves, promoting Sahaja Yoga together. Only unity will help us win; only collective power can defeat such forces. Especially in Delhi it's required to increase collectivity, as such each person in Delhi acts like the Prime Minister: even the PM is haunted now, don’t think you won't be! If you think you’re the PM, you’ll need bodyguards too (laughs).

Go ahead, sing another song.

Sahaja Yogi: Sahaja yogis walk with Mother’s power, don’t need bodyguards, don’t want to be Prime Minister.

Shri Mataji: [laughs] That’s exactly it—can't live in such falsehood. Simple living keeps the Kundalini alright, avoid bad behavior. But look how crooked the world is, people sitting in God's name. Anyone who tries to run in Sahaja Yoga is sorted out—not by me, but by you: if you want to go astray, what can I do? Decide where you want to go. Today, on New Year's Day, make a decision that you’ll stick with Sahaja Yoga no matter what. What does it mean? To receive your own power, to know your own greatness—what’s so hard about that? There’s no other way other than Sahaja Yoga.  In this path you get everything, so take it! That’s why I told them, there’s no need to fast. Those UP ladies did Karva Chauth fasting, but got sick. I warned them not to, but they didn’t listen. In ignorance you can hold a snake, but not when you have knowledge. If you want to fast, go ahead, but don’t drag God’s name into it—what’s the use? He gives everything but still you want to fast then do. Sometimes what I say may sound strange, but know that it’s the truth, accept it. Just because foolishness has gone on for years, do we keep repeating it? Has it ever helped? Even if something’s never happened before—it has to happen someday, right? [laughs] If you want to run away from Sahaja Yoga, arguments will always be there, but those who really want to stay can, the seats are ready. So settle in, everyone—I want everyone fully settled in Sahaja Yoga, that’s the main thing. Bring new people in too. As you said, ‘Mother, come as a lamp.’ What can one lamp do? There must be many lamps—only then will there be real light. If it was up to me alone, why would I request you to be steady? You’re all on stage, the world is watching you, not me. I’m set aside as ‘the Devi,’ but it’s you who matter now; as such Delhi-walas are always on stage, on the royal seat. You all are at the doorstep of God. People will watch you—tremendous responsibility rests on Delhi. Right, lekhak ji, say it, write it, yes."

Shri Mataji: "Deepa hasn’t come today?"

Sahaja Yogi: "She’s in Dharamshala."

Shri Mataji: "Sitting in Dharamshala. Okay, please, you start, open it up, play it—your face has really changed; see, his face has become saintly!"

Sahaja Yogi: "A great miracle happened, I’ll tell about it on stage tomorrow. The President has written to me..."

Shri Mataji (placing her hand on the yogi’s shoulder, smiling): "It’s done."

(Sahaja Yogis sing the bhajan: ‘Namastestu Mahamaye Shreepeethe Surapujite’)

Shri Mataji: "You all are singing so much Sanskrit now, it’s amazing—just don’t become full-on priests now! [laughs] The pronunciation is so pure, really amazing, very good, very beautiful, right? Actually, the voice is vibrating because of the vibrations, you see; even the voice is now getting those vibrations. When you sing, don’t you feel it vibrates, reverberates? They say in Sanskrit, it’s called 'pratisadha'—it feels like an echo, and now it’s come to your voice, too. It’s beautiful—really, you’re doing wonders. Such clear Sanskrit pronunciation—I’ve never heard it from Punjabis, honestly! [everyone laughs] I studied in Punjab too, and the language there is as it is, and Hindi speakers also say [in punjabi tone] but in Punjabis I’ve never heard this pure language. Really, it’s amazing—it should be this way."

Sahaja Yogi: "Basically, Mother, it’s all because of Rajesh’s efforts."

Shri Mataji: "Yes."

Sahaja Yogi: "It’s Rajesh’s effort, he started all this here."

Shri Mataji: "Look at Rajesh; now he is reading Gyaneshwari these days—imagine that!"

Sahaja Yogi: "He’s the one who started all this, Mother."

Shri Mataji: "Yes."

Sahaja Yogi: "Last time, when he and Rustam came, that was when it all started."

Shri Mataji: "Oh, so Sanskrit started then. Rustam never knew the Devanagari script, can you imagine? He studied in English medium, then went to England, so never learned Devanagari, but learned Sanskrit, and now has written a thousand names of mine in Sanskrit!"

Sahaja Yogi: "Rustam did?"

Shri Mataji: "Yes, he wrote a thousand names."

Sahaja Yogi: "He’s a Sanskrit scholar now."

Shri Mataji: "Beg your pardon?"

Sahaja Yogi: "He’s a Sanskrit scholar now!"

Shri Mataji: "He’s become a Sanskrit scholar, yes! Even Gregoire—Gregoire has become a Sanskrit scholar, absolutely! A Sanskrit scholar. How the result of Sahaja Yoga flourishes—Gregoire didn’t even know a word of Hindi, never learned Devanagari, yet writes so beautifully! Imagine—a person who didn’t know even the basics of Devanagari, how did he become like this? And then Baba, our own, doesn’t know any Urdu—I know a little, but he doesn’t know even a bit, but the poetry he wrote in Urdu, you couldn’t believe it. My own brother is a chartered accountant—never knew a thing about poetry, but he writes now so deeply! He even took the pen-name 'Bilos', meaning 'Nirmal', calls himself that now. My brother is surprised—where do you get these words from? He says, 'I don’t know, they just come, you give me.' I said, some words I even don’t know myself—how do I give? [everyone laughs] Amazing—he’s writing so well. It’s truly surprising how such talent blooms. Of all things, I never expected poetry from him—he’s a chartered accountant, only ever counted money, and now, I don’t know from where he got this. Now he’s writing in Marathi too—his Marathi was so weak that I used to write his essays for him! [everyone laughs] He’s writing in Marathi, in Hindi, but best of all, he’s writing in Urdu—real poetry, no forced rhymes; this is true poetry. Earlier, the poetry was all about separation and pain; now it’s about union, about meeting. You should set this [music] with Baba’s songs—there are many now, but earlier they weren’t so popular."

Sahaja Yogi: "He’s writing right from the heart, Mother."

Shri Mataji: "Hmm, I don’t know, but it’s remarkable. And for him to write poetry—I know his condition in poetry very well! When I tried to teach him Marathi poetry, he’d say, 'Why do people write all this? Just say things directly! Why go round and round with the moon and all that; just say what you mean!' [laughs] That’s how he was when he was younger, in school, learning Marathi—I said don’t learn then, but he would say it's compulsory what to do? He’d just about pass or fail, but his mathematics was good. How such a new flower blossomed, I don’t know—it’s like a lotus blooming in a rose bush, and even without thorns! Such unique, astonishing things are happening now, and like that, everyone should have some miracle come out from inside—then it will happen. He’s saying, 'I’ll tell you about a big miracle'—there really was a big miracle. You see, behind what you said—none of you can be stained; if anyone tries to tarnish you, that will boomerang on them. From the illustrated weekly, Rajneesh once paid money to a woman to take my interview, and then a Muslim woman to show it, and there was all sorts of wrong stuff written—but my husband and brother got angry, wanted to take them to court. I said, go ahead if you want, but I’m not going to court! In London, people suggested suing for ten lakh rupees, but I said it’s no use. I tried to explain to them so much, even told Rajesh to go and speak with those people [Rajneesh] to ask for forgiveness that this situation could be averted but nothing happened. In the end, that magazine 'Illustrated Weekly' had to close for six months, lost crores of rupees, and even their employees went on strike. They said to the editor, 'Why did you write against our Mother?' and threatened  strikes! I said, it was long ago, why strike now? But such people won’t change - these newspaper people—first they need to be corrected. Why even write about someone like Rajneesh? These days, Ravan is fashionable, the Gita is all twisted. They love publishing such nonsense. He’s in Goa now, and a few others are popping up in Pune as well—like bedbugs multiply, so do these people! [laughs] But everyone will get sorted, will definitely reach the right place. These people all seem to help each other as a group. We, too, must make our own strong group—no one should dare touch you! Everyone should be tied by one thread—if we know that, no one can touch us. When we don’t, that’s when the problems come."

"Now, it’s New Year, we are in Delhi; whatever wishes you have, fulfill them, we’ll see this evening at the puja. But all wishes should be for everyone, not for yourself—I already take care of you, don’t worry; do everything for the collectivity, for others, not for yourself. You already said you’ve put yourselves in my hands—so I’ll look after you; don’t worry about yourself, worry about the world, especially Delhi! Alright then." [Shri Mataji folds hands to greet everyone.]
