After Concert Talk Nargol 10-28-1995

Shri Mataji (in Marathi): Today, all things have been delayed and we all know the reason why. However, in Sahaja Yoga, we do not look at the clock. And we also do not keep thinking whether some things are happening as per the planned time or not.

Whatever happens "Sahaja" (with ease/without effort), only that gives true joy. Now these songs that were conducted earlier, they were in English, or I would say, in the Western style and you all like it. I found great satisfaction in that. Otherwise, there are a lot of music experts sitting here. And they will say, "Mataji, what is this that you have started here?". However, we should listen to all forms of music. 

Obviously, I am not referring to just any kind of music, that is coming out these days. But all forms of music. I am very fond of Western classical music. I am also very fond of South Indian music. And of course, ours. We have to have an extensive vision.

And I was very happy to see that you appreciated what the French people (Sahaja Yogis), presented to you, the songs. The lead singer among them, from Zaire, in Africa, he is a very famous singer. A very famous singer in France. And now he is in Sahaja Yoga. He teaches small children also and says all our mantras.

So there is a very big revolution in the world. They worship Shri Ganesha and sing praises of Shri Ganesha. This is such a big revolution that these people feel so much about our Gods and have so much knowledge about them and how they staged the play. I have not imposed this upon them unnecessarily. I never told them that they should stage such a play. Never. I have never forced them that they should create plays like this. 

However, they have their own innate understanding and experience. And based on that, they have created this play based on the incarnations from all religions, all on their own. I was really surprised at how minutely, they have covered and presented everything. It is a great wonder.

So, Sahaja Yoga has entered into their daily thinking and behaviour and they think from that perspective, how to present all religions in a unified manner. Therefore their play was presented very beautifully.

(in English): And I would like to congratulate the French people for giving us such a beautiful exposition of the Sahasrara opening. (Applause).

Even the music and poetry was very deep and beautiful and, I am really amazed at how the French has come here to celebrate Diwali. Diwali is celebrated by French people also. And poor thing, Marathi they call it "uchalbangdi" (sent someplace without being asked), they are going from one place to another. Last time they had it in Russia, now this time here, of all the places, this farfetched place called Nargol. So they have coming and organising and helping us and doing it so well, it is now a question of a global transformation.

And in that global transformation, we see that all the people of these countries who have never been to India before started feeling so much for Sahaja culture and have accepted it. And as in the Sahaja culture, we do not accept any nonsensical falsehood, from any religion. But to accept every religion and respect every religion is very important if you want to have peace. No doubt about it. In the name of God, we cannot fight. It is a very wrong idea.

Now we have seen how they brought it beautifully - for Sahasrara, it was important that all the deities had to help to get to the last point of Sahasrara. Tomorrow I will tell you more about it. But today I was impressed, the way they have grasped the principle of it. 

(In Hindi): Now it must be said after this, that you all have come from so far away, but the place is very beautiful. Very enchanting. And this is where I had come and opened the Sahasrara, that is also a wonder. You all must be very happy to be here. However the road to get here is difficult, troublesome and also those who have come from Delhi I can understand, must be wondering, "where have we come?". 

I must tell you that near Delhi, or between Delhi to Lucknow or, Lucknow to Patni, you will not find a place as beautiful as this. This is a speciality of Maharashtra, its glory. Although there are a lot of beautiful places in Haryana, the sea is not there. That is why, the "triveni sangam" (triple confluence) that is here, I wanted to open the Sahasrara here and bring you all here one day. And that is how this Diwali celebration that we have had here was so beautiful. 

After this, I want to talk about the great, renowned singer we had here today. As you already know, with how much beauty and how much love, he has collected songs of so many varieties. And in all of them, he has talked about your heart. And this why you liked it so much. 

(in Marathi): Maharashtrian people have a speciality. That if you hear classical music anywhere, be it in a rustic village, there is nothing else to be said. You just melt. All of you. There is no more to be said about them, it is just finished.

So, Ajit Kadkade (a renowned singer of devotional songs in Maharashtra) has come and entertained us so many times that I am indebted to him and all Sahaja Yogis are indebted to him. He has also come to Cabella. This time, we were busy with something else and he could not be invited. But everyone insists that he has to be invited every year. Now, his style of singing is so beautiful. He sings classical and he should sing classical, but he introduces so many rhythmic patterns in his music, sometimes fast, sometimes slow that even those who do not understand classical music, he will also [UNCLEAR]. He will think this is something novel. 

Now, if you start singing like say, Krishna Rao Pandit. That is it, everyone will leave within fifteen minutes. Now in today life of hustle bustle, if the way you have sung in these alternating patterns, everyone, everyone regardless of which country they are from, they have loved it and have been sitting spellbound and enjoying it. For that, I am really indebted to you. Because we are sitting in the jungle here and saying, we should have Ajit Kadkade Saheb's performance here, means, this is too much. 

I told them also, "Why did you make him take the trouble of coming here?" These roads are potholed, and we also came bumping up and down all the way. Coming here and finding out that you were also going to be there, I said, "That is it. Why give him the trouble?". 

But the faith and the affection by which you chose the songs and sang them so beautifully, it means a lot. Everyone tells me when we listen to Ajit Kadkade's songs in your presence, it is a different feeling altogether. But listening (to him alone), it is not so much. I said, "Is it"?

(To Ajit Kadkade): That is to say, you are also a very religious person, so much that your realisation has taken place and, there is an outpouring of devotion within you. Through this integration, you have attained the gift of artistic excellence. That is why our Sahaja Yogis, from abroad as well as India ask that we organise at least one of your programs abroad. This is an insistent request from everyone. But last time we were caught up in something else and it could not happen. However, each time, whenever it is possible for you, and whichever Puja you can attend, if you can let us know, it would be good. Because you are also very busy. So, on behalf of everyone today, I congratulate you. (Applause). 

(To All): I am very fond of music. Whenever I listen to it, I simply cannot fall asleep. I do not understand how people sleep. But I am innately musically inclined. I have not taken training or anything, but everyone in my family is a singer. I have learnt only by listening. But once a song begins, I cannot fall asleep. And if it is your song (Ajit Kadkade), not at all. I looked around at everyone and they were all sitting detached. Then, "chitravase ta thane" [UNCLEAR/like a still picture?] Due to this, today's Diwali has been celebrated so well and you have given such joy to everyone.

I am talking about this one song because everyone is sitting around feeling sad. There is no reason for sorrow. All said and done, I am seventy-three years old and you are all so young. So the question does not arise. 

Now, the second thing is that tomorrow, this group of people have come from Nagpur and tomorrow we are going to have their programme. 

One thing to mention is that the singers from Romania were probably musicians in their previous birth. Because, without going to any guru (teacher) - I know the kind of hard work that is required to learn from a guru, put up with their anger, I have seen this a lot. But they (singers) have not seen any guru, not fallen at the feet of any guru, I cannot understand from where this has emerged.

And just like that, one day, they asked, "Shall we sing on stage, Shri Mataji?". I said, "Go ahead". I felt what would they sing, maybe a Romanian song. Then they started with a "qawwali" (Sufi devotional music). And in that, a "tarana" (fast-paced version). And no one would know that these people are from Romania. Now on that day, they were wearing the same (qawwali performers) costumes. I felt that these people were great musicians in previous birth and are now born in Romania. 

Anyway, we see nowadays that a lot of young children, as young as ten, sing so beautifully. Even this is from a previous birth. Not just singing, they can play, etcetera. That means there are so many prodigies who have emerged. 

But these people, I really cannot understand. How they held it all together with so much rhythm and in tune. With so much emotion and yet very entertaining. Now this second poem, they had composed it by themselves. They do not know Urdu nor Farsi (Persian), or anything else, how they did it, I do not know. Similarly, the people from Switzerland composed a poem in Hindi. How they did it, I do not know. So this is something very spontaneous.

(In English): It is something very surprising around Romanians, but I think the French influence has worked. Because you people picked them up, it is very remarkable how can they sing so well. It is impossible. You have to work very hard to develop this kind of attention to music. I cannot understand. I am really surprised how you people have influenced them and looked after them. 

(In Marathi): We have this practice, you may know, that every country is looked after the people of another country. So for the people of Romania, the French are in charge. How they became (in charge), I do not know. 

And in this country of Romania, there is such a great level of self-realisation - that there are five thousand Sahaja Yogis. Five thousand. Absolutely well. 

And when I went there, I was (invited) to a university there, a very big university there, they have medical, engineering, everything - they have changed their name now. The chancellor received me and took me inside. He introduced me to everyone. I could not understand why they were giving me so much importance. The people of Romania.

Then they said, "Mataji, please give us a lecture on medical science." I said OK. "Metascience". Then I gave a lecture on Swadishthana chakra. Now you have heard it. Their eyes literally popped out. All the doctors who were sitting there started looking at me. Then I saw that the vice-chancellor was there, but not the chancellor. I wondered, "Where has he gone? Did he get angry?". As it was somewhat a challenge to medical. 

After some time he returned with a piece of paper. I thought it was some kind of award, they often give out. Now in America, they are giving me awards just about anywhere. Now in Russia, I was given an award named after Einstein. I felt this is a wonder indeed. But the award that they had, they gave a doctorate. A proper (doctorate). I mean a real doctorate, like the one that you get at a university. (Applause). 

And the subject of that was cognitive science. Meaning, the essence of all the sciences. The chancellor said it is the highest. And the way they honoured me, I was struck with surprise.

So there is something special about Romania. It might be named after the (Marathi) word "raman". "Raman karne" means when we are "doing raman" in meditation, swimming in the ocean of bliss is called "raman karne". I see something like that in these people. They gave me so much respect that I was very surprised.

The other thing to mention is that because this is to say, our annual, or rather, we can say, a centenary after twenty-five years. That these people gave me a lot of respect and they honoured me so much. I was surprised, how do they feel so much about me?

But I learnt one reason that could be the cause and you will be surprised to hear that. That, in Russia and Ukraine, three thousand years before Christ,

(Continuing in English): three thousand years before Christ, in Ukraine, and part of Russia and also Romania they used to worship the Primordial Mother who was called as Aditi. We too call her Aditi. 

And they told us, we are Aryans, we had a big rapport, with the Indians. We used to go there, and they used to come here. And we believe in the Primordial Mother, which was Aditi. And they had painted chakras, exactly like chakras. 

(In Marathi): Especially, Ganesha chakra, meaning the Mooladhara chakra.

(In English): Mooladhara chakra, with four petals and Agyna chakra with two petals. Beautifully painted. I was surprised. And they believe in the awakening of the Kundalini. And they showed me, in the stomach of the Adi Shakti, the Aditi, there was the Kundalini. Three thousand years back. I said now if they know our music, I am not surprised. 

I think Macchindranath and Gorakhnath, who were travelling all over, must have come there. And they were from Maharashtra. They have described. I think they must have told them about the Primordial Mother. And this is how, three thousand years back, they were worshipping. But when the Christian influence came, it was all suppressed. 

It is very interesting, so many scholars have done it. So many things are happening now in the world. And I am sure Sahaja Yoga will be respected and accepted all over the world. I am very sure. (Applause).

Especially for music, I must say that music carries vibrations. It is the rhythm of it, it carries the vibrations, the "lahari" (waves), which we call as "Soundarya Lahiri" (waves of beauty) or we can call it "Chaitanya Lahiri" (waves of bliss) are really carried by notes and music. And, that is why, all of them, though they are people not acquainted with our Indian music, they appreciate it. 

It has something to do with our Spirit and it is known, that music has come from our Atma. That is why everyone, they do not know any "ragas", they do not know any "taalas", but they appreciate it. And now they have started understanding "ragas" and even "taal". 

One fellow went to, [UNCLEAR], he went to Belgium. And he said, "Mother, I am surprised, the Indians in Belgium are stupid fools." I said, "Why"? "The fellow was singing "pilu" (raga) and they did not know what "pilu" was. I said, "They are uprooted Indians who have come abroad, so do not worry." 

You see, that is how this is spreading all over the world. And it is working out very well. So at this time of Diwali, I wish all the good luck to Indian musicians and to all the classical musicians of the world.
