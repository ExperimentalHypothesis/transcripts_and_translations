All this living work is done by this all-pervading divine power, but we have never felt it before. When this kundalini rises and pierces through the fontanelle bone area then you can feel this power, as cool breeze of Holy Ghost. For the first time, you feel it and you are amazed how we never had this experience before. Once it happens, then you are amazed at yourself because you become really very compassionate and very dynamic. You can see your problems clearly and when you can see them, you can solve them much better. Then you realise what is divine discretion. Not only that you know yourself, but you also know others on their centres. Because you develop a new awareness; a new dimension in this human awareness which we call as collective consciousness, where you can feel others on your fingertips. These centres tell you what’s wrong with others also. If you can cure yourself, you can also cure others. In India, three doctors got their M.D. when they cured people with Sahaja Yoga. Many incurable diseases can be cured by you yourself, with your own power. But we have to believe in ourselves, we have to have self-confidence. If this instrument [mic] was not connected to the mains, it has no identity, it has no meaning. In the same way, if you are not connected to this all-pervading power, we have no identity. So, people start searching, they get into some sort of fads or they get into some cults or some sort of a nonsense they do. All kinds of ideas are poured for such people who are seekers.

As you must have heard about what happened in Japan or in America, where they declared that World is coming to an end and to finish the whole World. This is absurd, because the World is not coming to an end. In Sahaja Yoga, we don’t have any weapons, we don’t even have a dagger with anyone. [repeats for translator] But this is what is misleading point and people take to it very easily. This is very surprising, how people take to such stupid things. Also, I don’t understand how after knowing so much about these religious institutions, still they stick on to them. One must use one’s intelligence to judge whether the person who is talking of religion or anything, how far they are truthful. Last of all, you have to know that you reach a state of complete joy. Joy is not like happiness and unhappiness, but it is absolute. As you know absolute knowledge on your fingertips, you also get absolute joy. Thus, we get rid of all nonsensical things and ascend above all these stupid ideas that are prevalent.

This is your own, your own idea, and you should get it without any trouble. But I have seen people who are still stuck into stupid ideas and cannot understand they have to achieve the truth. So, we have to understand that it is high time that we get to absolute truth. For which, you don’t have to pay, there is no obligation of any kind. Only thing, you must have self-confidence. Another thing is that I cannot force self-realisation on you. You have to actually ask for it.  It is your freedom, I respect. If you want to have, you can have it. But if you don’t want to have, how can I force? As I told you, that this is a living process, last breakthrough of your evolution. For which, you have to have pure desire. Because this kundalini is the power of pure desire. It will hardly take 10-15 minutes to achieve that. But if you don’t want it, I cannot force on you. So, all those who don’t want, please leave the hall.

How many people are Hungarian here? Quite a lot. [inaudible]

So, there are three conditions which are very simple. The first one is that you have to forgive yourself. You must have full confidence in yourself. I think it’s a fashion also, to feel guilty all the time. But when you feel guilty, then you catch on the centre [showing left vishuddhi] on this left-hand side. As a result, you develop a disease called spondylitis. Also, angina. Also, your organs become lethargic. When you make mistakes, you must face it at that moment. But, what’s the use of feeling guilty about it. At the most, you can decide I will not commit such a mistake again. But, why to condemn yourself all your life and ruin your centre here [showing left vishuddhi]? It seems in Hungary is quite a lot. This [left vishuddhi] centre is very bad here. Alright, the second point, second condition is that you have to forgive everyone. Forgive everyone without even thinking about them. Because, whether you forgive or don’t forgive, you don’t do anything. When you don’t forgive, then of course you play into wrong hands. And torture yourself for nothing at all. While the person whom has troubled you, whom you are not forgiving, is enjoying life nicely. So, why carry on with this myth? Specially at this moment, is very important that you forgive everyone without thinking about them. Because thinking about them also causes headache. Moreover, at this important moment, the centre on the optic-chasma is constricted like this, absolutely. And if you don’t forgive, it won’t open [shows cross with fingers closed and then square-shaped opening]. And, how will this kundalini then go through it? So please, just say in your heart that ‘I forgive everyone’ without even thinking about them[?], in general. I have already told you that you have to have full self-confidence that you all will get your realisation here, tonight. Also, if you don’t mind, please take out your shoes because this Mother Earth helps us a lot. Some people are even attached to their shoes, you know [laughs].
