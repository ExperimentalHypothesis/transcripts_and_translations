 Volume : XI Isue: 11 & 12 The Divine Cool Breeze Nov Dec. 3. 1999 DHYANA, DHAARNA AND SAMADHI By Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi (January â€“ 1984) I will tell you a few things about meditation. It is my immense joy to see all of you here from various parts of the world. When your heart is so full, the words are too poor to carry the intensity. I wish you could understand that intensity through your heart. It's all been arranged, I think, by the Divine, that we should meet here all of us in such a wonderful surrounding. in the Nature. that something great should happen to all of us. That we should achieve something really great this time. Now as time is short, I will tell you first of all a few things The first part of meditation is the Dhyana. First when you have seeking, you put your attention towards the object of your worship. That is called as Dhyana. And the Dhaarana is the one in which you put all your effort. Concentrate all your effort. But this is all drama for people who are not realised. For them it's just a sort of an acting that they do. But for a realised soul it is a reality. So the first, the Dhyana, you have to do. Some do it of the Form, another of the Formless. But you are so fortunate that the Formless has become a Form for you. No problem, you don't have to go from Form to Formless, from about meditation now. Formless to form; it's all there, in a Meditation is a very general word. It is bundle. So you concentrate, or think of nota word that explains all the three steps some Deity, or some point for Nirakar, one has to take for meditating. But in for the Formless, or of Nirakar itself. It's Sanskrit language they have very clearly all a mental projection as long as you are said, how you have to move in your not a realised soul. But, once you are meditation. realised, you have just to think of Dhyana, whom you are going to concentrate, or First is called as Dhyana, and seeond is you can say meditate on. But once you start meditating on a person you attention called as Dhaarna, and the third is called Samadhi. slarts moving. That is also possible after realisation, though it is in a bundle; but some people have it-'part of it,' part of Luckily Sahaja Yoga is such a thing that you get everything in a bundle. You avoided everything else and you got the it', like that. So when you meditate, still your attention Samadhi part. That's the beauty of it.

 Nov Dec. Volume : XI Issue : 11 & 12 The Divine Cool Breeze 1999 your eyes, nose, and all these organs, all that, becomes a kind of manifestation of the Deity whom you worship, with can get disturbed every moment. It can happen, depending on the intensity of your concentration. So, there are some automatically. Sahaja Yogis, I've seen, they are cooking, and there's another one is meditating. The You don't have to think-now I must concentrate, alright, I will not have these meditating one will say: "Oh, I can smell it is burning". thoughts, I have to now think about this. It becomes, automatically there; you read a book, in that book immediately you find So there is no Dhaarna. Dhyana is there but not Dhaarna. The second part of it is what is good for Sahaja Yoga. If there is very important, that you have to put your attention continuously on to your deity. a book which is anti-God you discard it, the state that is awakened within you is a Then you develop a state which is called as Dhaarna in which your attention new state of mind, in Sanskrit language ithas a very beautiful name, Ritambhara becomes one, with the Deity. But when Pragnya, which is a very difficult name. these mature, the third stage, of Samadhi, Ritambhara is the name of the Nature, and comes in. that the whole Nature one feels is Now for people who think that without enlightened. realization they can reach Samadhi, I I'll give an example; when a child is to be born, the mothers start lactating. automatically. The nature itself works out think they are absolutely mistaken. But after realization also, when the Dhaarna is established you have to get for the birth of the child. to the position where you become Samadhi. Now, what is that state? When that state comes into your mind, then Pragnya starts expressing itself, only for whatever you do, the Deity that you Sahaja Yoga, nobody else, you are In the same way, when this Ritambhara worship, you see that Deity in your work; whatever you see, you see the Deity amazed how things work out suddenly. So the Ritambhara Pragnya has started giving you the show; you can put it like working in your favour. You all tell me this is a miracle, that has happened that. Whatever you hear, you find the Deity telling you the truth, Whatever you read, you find there what the Deity would tell Mother, and we don't know how it has happened. I'll give you an example; Yesterday, we were doing something with cement and the Italian boy said that we you. So, in that state, whatever you do

 Volume XI Issue 11 & Dec. Nov 1999 The Divine Cool Breeze you are the saints, you are chosen ones of God. But you accept that situation first; but if you behave like all other normal will need two bags of cement. I said, you carry on, it won't finish. Even before I was leaving, they were people-Oh God, shops are closed, and that man is so difficult, and I don't think it will happen. It'll never happen. But you carrying on, still not finished. Now cement, of all the things, imagine! must know you are saints, chosen, and So this special thing is your own state given birth by Me, the Form and the where you are feeling one with Nature Formless. and the Nature is feeling oneness with you. So the Divine itself is expressing through Nature, through various happenings, through various incidents-the love, the protection, the attention that the Divine is giving. And there's no end to it. So this Pragnya is going to manifest, is manifesting every moment. Be prepared, be happy, welcome it and accept that you are there. The level is different Now the time has come-for Sahaja Yoga to change It just happens, and people don't know it's level. how it happens. But that is what is the We have to change. state of Samadhi. But there could be We have to go higher. people if I tell them "Will you do this?" The level has to come up.

That means you are rather Don't take it as anything ill. I could not have said this even two years back or one human beings we become aware in our year back.

So your conscious was still working half way through unconscious working of the Chakras and the conscious working of the Today is a great day for all of us because it is the 16th Sahasrara Day i.e. 16 beats mind. You also never felt your higher position in the poem. That it is complete. autonomous nervous system or your inner Shri Krishna is called a complete organs, how they are working. You did Incarnation because he has 16 petals. noteven feel how you are getting affected This completeness is called as Purana. by other influences. As a result of that So now we move into another dimension. with the freedom that human beings The first one was where you got your achieved or were granted, they gathered self realisation. In the evolutionary all kind of things into their brains, into or 16 movements to reach a process, if you see, the animals are not conscious of many things which human beings are conscious of. Like the matter their Sahasrara without being aware of it. They used their Sahasrara, their brain for all kinds of purposes which were fruitless. They were not aware again of the warning that Shri Krishna had given that if you use human awareness except cannot be used by animals for their own purpose. Also they are not conscious of themselves at all. If you show a mirror to animals they do not react to it as if for your ascent, you will go downward. They were told, not that they were not they were in the mirror. Except for I think

 7. Volume: XI Issue : 11 & 12 Nov - Dec. The Divine Cool Breeze 1999 All the organizations which you have formed also on collective understanding told, they knew about it. Whether it was East or West, everybody knew that you have to be born again and it so happened are artificial. Then a movement had started that we have to be natural. That is another copying of the artificial. Natural that in the West people thought that by using their brain power they can now master the matter, that they can use matter does not mean a primitive personality. Natural is to evolve. The whole purpose of creation is to evolve. So the another for their own purpose. If they had done that after their self realisation, it would have been a very different situation concept also, that you accepted very easily because you have brains and you accept everything that comes your way, and is that you became so artificial that you needed all the times some sensations to feel yourself. Now in every walk of because after self realisation you all have become aware of vibrations which is Chaitanya and also of your Chakras. With this new awareness you would have avoided all that was wrong but it is like a greedy person who gets a wee bit of life there is a conceptual, artificial money and he spends it off. Now this understanding. For example you see the problem has complicated your brains. You sex. It is such a natural, nomal thÃ¬ng. have certain concepts which are very There is nothing so great about it. But much away from reality. The way we have that also you made so artificial that you started using machines we have become have now your sex in your brain. By that machines ourselves. So we have no not only you have silenced Ganesha in feelings and we cannot relate to others in the Mooladhaara but also Maha a natural way. In human awareness you Ganesha in your brain. had achieved how to relate yourself to In another aspect, say Art. Now the others and to the nature. But this ego concept is so stupid that it says that art oriented approach took you away from should be according to what is laid down. natural real life, and we became artificial. Like you will call somebody and go rock, The whole thing comes from a concept condemn it, Oh This That. Condemn of being artificial. Like they say that its fashionable to be the arrogant, to be every one. And ultimately you reach a conclusion that the most insignificant is snobish. art. As if like a sugarcane when you have taken out all the juice whatever remains will become art one day. So the brain which 'does not nourish the heart is It is just the opposite of your ascent and the evolutionary process because you have dodged the power to relate to others had gained as human beings. absolutely. an artificial brain just like

 Nov Dec. Volume : XI Issue: 11 & 12 The Divine Cool Breeze 1999 robots. So people have become just like robots. Now this can be handled by anyone who has the master mind because programme and within two weeks all will disappear. Because when the ascent takes place, the Kundalini pushes out the ego and brings the person close to reality. But again that ego, which is being built up so fast in a speed, overpowers the speed of you do not have your own heart and the brain is controlled by somebody who has a greater brain of concepts. All these the Kundalini and covers the head. Then concepts are destructive. it suggests that how can you have godly life. You will mix all the alcohol, all the Hitler got the concept that he is an Aryan and he is of the superior race. I have to establish that he did not mind destroying the whole world. Same is the case in the religion field. There also every religion was put or poured into the cups of madness, all the fun of life. That they feel they will lose all the freedom to become mad. When you see from this position, the way people react, it is amazing. You have to do something extremely stupid concepts. to sell it in the market. The other day I heard that somebody had become rich, Now the worst concept that human beings have achieved is that money is everything. First they tried for political domination, selling the empty tins as lamps. All kinds of stupid things which are nowhere near natural beauty or natural joy are accepted thinking that political domination is everything. It affected their system. When I started my life I saw complicated as sophisticated. The other side of it is that the Asuri Vidya, Sahasraras. The more I tried to solve the the Black Vidya has taken over. Shri complications within my own awareness Krishna again had warned that, in the 15th the more it became complicated (more Chapter, that if Asuri Vidya takes over, difficult), because if you see my age, in then the Shudh Vidya cannot compete fifty years you can see how much with the speed of Asuri Viday. Like in complicated human beings have become. America there had been a big argument And after opening the Sahasrara when I amongst Sahaja Yogis, if my photograph came to the West, within these 16 years I should be in the drawing room or not? But if you ask them to paint their names found that they are now in horrible state. Now the stage for you is laid down to ascend higher. This is the background which I have described to you, and you black, their face black and black clothes likes witches, they will do that. That even at a stage we are Sahaja Yogis we are shy of our Godly Life. When they became hippies or when they became anything like can see how when you have a programme there will be 500 people for the

 Volume XI Issue: 11 & 12 Nov Dec. 1999 The Divine Cool Breeze that stupid, they gave all their life, all their and the background is so dark. You are time, all their money too. They changed surrounded by people who are pouring their dresses, they changed their life out morning till evening destructive styles, they changed their family life, concepts. Now you are the people who everything they changed, went all out have to shoot out much faster than all of And even when Sahaja Yogis are them. But a kind of a lethargy, though convinced about the Godliness of Sahaja you understand that your awareness is very different from them, a kind of a lethargy which does not accept it the way Yoga, still they are shy. And you know your Mother does not take money from you. On the contrary she spends. You all have gained out of it. But when it comes to giving, everybody feels shy. it should accept Sahaja Yoga. Everyone of you must think everyday, what have I done for Sahaja Yoga today? But you are all feeling very busy with your jobs, making money, of our relations with, people who do not matter at all in Sahaja Yoga. We have to make an all out effort to rise to that point that whatever we know, we From that background you are coming to the light of God's grace. But you do not want to dash at it. You want to take your time gradually, so gradually that may be, you may lose your chance. So in the awareness of Sahaja Yogis where you u believe in, we act on that and become one with it. You can do that with know all your Chakras, you know about vibrations, you know how to relate to others, still all this knowledge is for concepts but not with reality. This is the problem. I will explain this point. Like personal advantages. So the shadow of the past still lingers on even when you have this new awareness. Animals can supposing a fanatic believes that he can do such and such thing in his own religion, he will do it. But the concept is not reality. swim automatically. They do not have to learn. But human beings have to learn how to swim. So they have forgotten the techniques which were known to the animals and have taken to the techniques of human beings. But in Sahaja Yoga you have got your realisation in one life time, and in this life time you have to grow. and in this life time you have to achieve It has given no benefit to anyone, had shown no performance of any substance. Still people do it! I see in my own country when they were fighting for freedom, my father himself gave up all his property, gave up his practice with 11 children in the family, we were living in palaces, started living in huts, for days together, for years together. For the gross freedom, we do the highest. So the time is so very short everything. But for the secular freedom

 Volume : XI Issue : 11 & 12 The Divine Cool Breeze Dec. Nov 10 1999 the Sahaja Yogis have to do everything that is possible. subtler but in your consciousness, you are not yet subtle. There are so many things you know more than the people who are not realised, as absolutely realised. For example we do not even use vibrations. Whenever it is needed we do not use them or sometimes mechanically, just like a So the first thing is to realise, to be aware, to be in your conscious mind all the time, that you are Yogis. You are the ones who are very much higher than the rest of the humanity. That the machine, we start giving Bandhan. So you are still unconscious about your salvation of the whole of the humanity depends on you. The purpose of creation will be served by you. So first Chakras. Slightly conscious when you of all you have to be conscious in your put your mind to it otherwise in your consciousness that you are so central nervous system you are not yet so conscious. This is the reason why you important and that is why you were do not know, why you have to do a thing at a particular time. Unless and until you given realisation. How can you be living with your conditionings and with your ego? The conditionings are like this - Supposing you are coming from a Christian religion, then you must bring that little bit of that religion into raise yourself and try to achieve Nirvikalpa stage, you cannot go further. For example I know everything that I do. I can handle any power whenever I want. I can absorb any negativity I want to and need not absorb any negativity I do not want to. You may be thousands of miles Sahajayoga or if you are from Hindu religion you want to bring some out of that. We have all the essences of peace in Sahaja Yoga, the pure essences but away from me, I know about every one of you. I may not know your worldly we cannot have the groSs nonsense. All these things are like dirt over our names but I know you as part and Sahasrara which must be shaken off. parcel in my being. I also can behave like a human being, absolutely like you, aging like you, wearing, using spectacles, doing all the things that will make me a Though now you are aware and conscious of your Chakras you do not keep them clean. Ordinary human beings, if they have clothes, they have houses, they try to keep it clean. But you do not feel ashamed of them also when they are bad, because after complete human being, and I have accepted this growth consciously, not unconsciously. To me nothing is unconscious. sometime you also lose the awareness So if you have to be conscious of what of them. That means you have become

 Nov Dec. 1999 11 Volume XI Issue 11 & 12 The Divine Cool Breeze you are doing you have to be alert about it. The first thing that you have we have got self knowledge but we have not got self consciousness. Now for example you take somebody's name, say, of some great saint, you feel the vibrations also. Also you know why, because he is a saint. But why not you the Sahajayogis, if your names are achieved is the peace. But even now I find that peace which should become joy becomes a quarrel. Truth is one. You cannot argue about truth. It is a whole genius. It does not quarrel with each taken why not the vibrations flow? And other. We are unconscious about our in this you have taken advantages because Adi Shakti herself is before you. They did fields but when we have to hold something, all of them come together to work it out. So the point of the brain not have anybody to tell them all these which is working this out, the things. But the disadvantage of that is this unconscious part of it, is to be made that you take it for granted. conscious. That is what evelution is. So Now in expression when we say now adherence to any concept is something, when we express, are we against evolution. You must learn to natural? Are we doing it from our heart? face the reality, to accept the reality The consciousness that I am doing it and act in real way. Now you may say, from my heart is what I want you to achieve. Like there are people who work very hard in Sahajayoga. Others will just happens this is a miracle. May be for the human beings, may be for Sahajayogis take it for granted. They don't want to also, but not for me. I know what it is. So, to rise above this half-baked consciousness, one has to see how one is help. They want everything to be ready made. That shows that they are not conscious of their own powers of enjoyment. If they do it from their heart then they will never feel what effort they have put in. They will only feel what they have been blessed with or what they have working it out. The whole system of relating to each other must change completely. That is very important at least for Western people, because atleast in India people know that human efforts lead achieved. The sense of fulfilment and satisfaction will overcome all your problems especially of your left you nowhere and you have to take to your ascent. I mean the real Indians. Some of them do take advantage of Sahajayoga Vishudhi. and then disappear. But most of them Now the second stage would be where know that you have to be conscious of you will be conscious of whatever you what you have got. So we can say that

 Nov - Dec. Volume : XI Issue : 11 & 12 The Divine Cool Breeze 12 1999 are doing, where there will be no mistakes. Whatever you will do may You have to mature in your ascent. Now you may say what should we do? Face yourself everyday. In reality, see be alright. Nobody is so far like that, I how much time you spend about want to tell you because some people do mundane worries and how much about feel whatever I say of praising, I am saying your ascent. Have you left everything, it to them. Now for example, today I had all your worries to God Almighty? my watch, I wanted to set my watch, so I Have you completely jumped out of pulled the screw out, simple thing. Now your background? Have your come way out all the way leaving everything that appear to be mistake will turn out to this I did, I would say, in a unconsciously but quite consciously because watch stopped. As I knew what was nonsensical? And how do I relate to others? How do I talk to others, who are Sahaja Yogis? I am surprised sometimes, if one Sahaja Yogi is attacked by a non-Sahaja Yogi, that a Sahaja Yogi group should support a non-Sahaja Yogi! Or a Sahaja Yogi who has to come up pays more attention to the negative people than to the positive! He relates better to the people who are negative than to the people who are positive. He is more friendly and open with negative persons than with the positive. You have to cling on to the positive but it is always the other way round because, it is very subtle ego in that. All this subtle understanding, I have told you many a times. But with your complicated brain, which is like a machine, like a spoiled computer, you can reach some conclusion out of what I have said which is just contrary. Like supposing I said, you forget the past. That means time I have to be there. So consciously I have put myself against myself. If the watch had not stopped I would have come earlier, but that was not the time I had to come. So I had to pull the screw to keep it stopped. So whatever mischief you play you know and you can play it against yourself, and then you can make a drama, Oh I made a mistake and things like that, for nothing at all. But such a stage is far off, I must tell you. Just now the stage is fixed. We are still making lots of mistakes because we are not self conscious. In a gross way we understand self conscious- ness like this-that a person has to go for interview, he has to select a suit properly, he combs his hair properly before going, he clears his throat. But when it is the question of your ascent, are we alert? Or we take it for granted that Mother is just now going to give us a nice bath, put us in the cradle and take us there? This is being cherished. you forget everything that is good of the past? That is, as if I wish you should not understand why you are behaving like

 Nov Dec : 11 & 12 13 1999 Volume: XI Issue The Divine Cool Breeze before, a cleverness. this? Forget the past, means do not allow the past to overpower. So you don't argue about it. Don't argue with A brain which is simple, which is about Sahajayoga. You don't argue straight forward, which has got love your leaders. You may be his wife but in it, can understand what I am saying don't argue. We are having a very bad straight forward. This complicated time from some of the wives of the leaders brain is to be put right and the best because they try to influence the way is to stop thinking, just stop husbands. As far as Sahajayoga is thinking. That is what you have to do. concerned they have nothing to do with that. Supposing you are working in an Now when you stop thinking you feel that nothing can be done but by office and the husband is some great official and you are a clerk, will you correct the husband? In this case the thinking only you do not do it. Now for example I have to give you a speech now if I start thinking about it, what will women have to nourish the organization, nourish the husband with love, from their you hear? Can you hear my thinking? You have to, say, enlighten these lamps. Alright, then you just start thinking about it, I have to enlighten. Will it get enlightened? This is to be understood that by thinking you do not do it. Thinking is lazy man's guard, as is used to avoid work. Once Iasked a lady. heart and not from their brain. I think it is so great to her, being born as a woman myself, because I can enjoy the heart, the emotions, the emotions of my love; the working and the play of my love. It is so great that no incarnation can enjoy that as I can. So the women should not feel I had in the house, that we are going out, will you be cooking something for us. When we came back, she had not cooked anything. She used to cook everyday but that day she did not cook anything. I said Why did not you cook something for us? "She said, "I thought you may eat outside." She was a Westerm lady. So my husband said, alright we are going to eat outside, you stay at home. I said it does not look nice. He said, "No, let her know what she thought is meant for herself." So this is the escape which you have learnt degraded if they have to look after the heart. But they are in a way in a higher aspect. You can do without thinking but you can't do without the heart. So the ladies should not argue with their husbands if they are leaders and also one should not argue otherwise also. Because I have seen if the women are very argumentative, the men become deaf. They just do not listen what women are talking. If they are very aggressive then the men become absolutely shut up. So in relationship with each other, you

It is for you, for all of you, each one of you, and you must integration has taken place. The only powers of Shri Vishnu have to act according to the deity, surrendered at the Lotus feet of the deity. So the consciousness of Shri Vishnu is absolutely in the hands of the deity. I do not want to talk about this tremendous deity. It is too much, because it may fill you up with awe. So whatever is working out, allow it to know yourself, how far you are going every day. Today is a special day of Sahasrara. Actually if you see, according work out. They say surrender your Sahasrara to the deity and it is so simple for you because you have the deity, you have your own Sahasrara and it is only to the Sun Calendar, Sahasrara would have been tomorrow. It is Monday which is a Sahasrara. Just imagine that we are having it one day earlier. So one has to know that a Calendar of God has nothing you, the people who are the Sahajayogis today, in modern times, who have seen the deity.

 Nov - Dec. 11& 12 Volume: XI Issue 18 The Divine Cool Breeze 1999 SHIV PUJA, DELHI 14-2-99 Talk by Her Holiness Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi Today we have assembled here to do the puja of Shri Maha Deva â€“ Shri Shiv Shankara. Because of Adi Shankaracharya's emphasis people have taken up the Puja of Shiva in a big way. In Southern India two sects have come up: one is Shaivites and the other is Vaishnavites. Shaivites are the worshippers of Lord Shiva and the Vaishnavites are those who worship Lord central path-is the path of Lord Vishnu. 1S Through this path we attain the Shiva Tattva. So Shiv Tattva is the destination and the path is made by Lord Vishnu. This central path is the creation of Lord Vishnu and the Adi Shakti; Lord Shiva has no role in it: He sits comfortably in his Seat, without bothering for any body; if someone wishes to come, may come. To attain Shiv Tattva we should go through this Vishnu Path (Sushumna Path) and Vishnu. In our country we are very expert in dividing ourselves. We divide Deities correct all the centres that are created on it When the centres are cleansed, the as well, and when we try to reunite them then things take a very bad (Vidrup) Vishnu path opens up and our ascent Shape. "Ayyappa' cult in the Southern begins. Many a times I have told about India is an example. According to them when Lord Vishnu assumed the form of Heart, which we call 'Left Heart'. This is "Mohini' then from Lord Shiva she got a not the centre of the heart, In a way it is child. Is it possible? Such nonsensical the reflection of Shri Maha Deva in the beliefs are generally spread in our heart. The abode of Shiva is above our country? Then they form different groups Minds and Thoughts. and find out excuses to fight with each To attain Shiv Tattva we have to see how all these centres. There is a centre in other? If Indians have nothing to fight pure our heart is? We give place to many over, then they create something from their own imaginations. evil thoughts in our hearts. e.g. jealousy. There is no use of becoming jealous: we should not feel jealous of any one. They might have harassed us or done harm to us, jealousy does no good to you. If your heart is pure then the mirror in which the reflection of Lord Shiva has to come u So these two things are connected with each other as Sun is with sun light, Moon with Moon light and word with its meaning.

But if you are full of jealousy leader and who is what? then the mirror will not remain clean and The Second thing with Indians is that they as such the reflection of Lord Shiva will feel jealous in money matters. Even in also not be perfect. Enemity and ill feelings for others are not to be fostered Sahaja Yoga people have jealously on in the heart. That is why Christ has said account of money matters. Someone has to forgive every one. Forgiving is very important. Many Saints, before and after doing Sahaja work people see how much Christ, have said the same thing, that money one earns and how much he gives "Forgive everyone'. The moment you forgive your enemy, immediately Lord Shiva takes over. The power of Shri got more money and some less. While for Sahaja Yoga. The person whose heart is obsessed with money is useless for Sahaja Yoga because materialism has caught his heart. If you are caught in the clutches of materialism then Mahadeva is the Subtlest and it punishes the evil doer in a nice way. This is the your ascent is very difficult. This is the work of Lord Shiva, its not your work. speciality of our country only. I have not seen it in foreign countries. In Russia and Eastern Block countries there is very little of wealth but they are not much bothered about money. Their heart is so much Therefore jealousy for any one is very bad. But I find that there is lot of jealousy even in Sahaja Yoga. Sahaja Yogis are jealous of each other. If one person is made trustee, the other one will feel jealous. possible only with the pure heart.

But we Only in a pure heart it could work out should think as to why we get angry. because the reflection of Shiva falls in our Some people said to me that Shri Mataji. heart and for that the heart should be pure. There are people who are angry with a "If some one speaks against you. we feel It is said that Shiva gets angry only once. Buu I have seen him getting angry many a times. It is his right. If some one works against Adi Shakti, then he has the right and he has very long hands. He finishes up such people because he knows that Adi Shakti will not do anything herself. She will not punish anyone. She will forgive all those who commit sins against Her. The powers of Shiva are limitless. When He wants to punish then no one very angry." But if some one speaks against me then I really feel like laughing at him, because there is no meaning at all in speaking against me. I am going to love all.even then if they speak against me then what could I do! But some people are insensible enough. They are to be pitied upon. We have to think that such a person is a big fool and we should look very compassionately at him. This outlook will pacify his anger. In our country there are different kinds of people and organisations who get angry. They will can stop Him. Who is there to check Him? He has got his own protocols, which could not be changed. So in their individual lives Sahaja Yogis have to follow Lord Shiva. If you do not follow Him then first thing will be that you will have heart problem. This is the first punishment. It works out in two ways. Firstly with excessive anger your heart catches and secondly as after effect of the be angry with some one, heat others and kill some others. This is becoming a social evil. This violence is very dangerous and for this they recruit army of their own. It IS very dangerous. If some one does so for his own protection then it is justified to some extent, but if a person is a seeker (A Bhakta) then why does he need

You are unable to understand the feelings of love with which the poor fellow had given you that anger when a person repents he gets the disease of Angina'. Both, Anger and repentance are harmful. But one can not get rid of anger because like drinking present. anger also becomes a habit. Once one starts enjoying it the face of an angry In India we have the example of Sudama. Sudama went to meet Shri Krishna and twok along roasted rice to be presented person gets distorted and he goes in the state of delirium. No one can control such to Shri Krishna. Shri Krishna ate those a person. So, as a solution. I thought that if you sit before the mirror and get angry rice with great respect and love. Anything on yourself, rebuke yourself and say, 'I presented with the feelings of love is just am the most stupid fellow', then, may like paras' chemical which when put be. you get rid of your anger. I am saying behind the glass, makes it a mirror. Similarly, if you have feelings of love for someone, but for want of money you offer some small present then it should be received by him with the same love and respect. This feeling of love gives a subtle sight to the person. It is artistic, Art that it is possible to get rid of anger. But the problems are so complicated that it is difficult to find out solutions. Further it is seen that the more attention we pay to some thing, the more we react. There is reaction to everything and this reaction is much more in foreign countries. Here emanates from it So how much artistic is this art of love! By this you could see. there is a carpet, immediately they will how much love is there in this person? How much loving is he! How gentle and say. "I don't like it, I like it." Who are they to say all this? But it has become a fashion to say 'I like it, I don't like it', as nice is he? When you start seeing this quality in others then you will look within yourself also and think, "What am I ? 'Da I have that much of love?" Am I so gentle?" Do I have all this goodness in meor am I rendering lip service only and thus confusing the people! Matter-of-fact by our misdeeds we confuse ourselves and none else. By our wrongful thoughts and styles of life we can give comforts to none and to ourselves, not at all. So from the point of view of Swartha if everyone were a renowned doctor who says 'Ilike it', I don't like it'. This should not be said. This is the indication of your bad Agnya. What do you think about yourself that you say, 'I like it. I don't . like it You have no right to do that. Someone offers you a beautiful flower and you immediately say. "Idon't like this flower." You are unable to understand the fceling of love of that person because Shiv

You So far I have talked to you, about three enemies. The fourth enemy present within must know the meaning of Self. For this purpose people do the puja of Lord Shiva. But I have seen that the worshippers of us is 'Ego". Ego-centric ladies behave like Shiva are hot tempered, miserly and what not! No deity is as generous and as loving as Lord Shiva. He is the source of love. men. They start walking like men, like ladies they can not walk. Ego comes to them for many reasons because of money, beauty, High Education etc. Whatever the cause, under the impact of The love that is flowing today is emanating from His Holi feet, It'is because of Him that human beings are ego, ladies start walking like men and ego-effected men start behaving like bathing in the ocean of love and all this work is getting done. After sef realization when you attain that state - The state women. I mean such a man makes himself up, for hours sits before the mirror, combes his hair again and again and all sort of stupidity. Such a person behaves of say Jeev Atma, then your attention gets established in the Holy feet of Lord Shiva like women. Its for the women to do the make up. He cannot walk straight. From behind, if you see him walking you will and the qualities of five elements (Pancha Tattva) become very subtle and manifest. Already I have told you about the four feel that it were some lady in male dress, elements but the fifth one, 'Ether', I didn't moving ahead with ego. They get intoxicated like elephants, In all their (Sky Element), When a seeker ascends. activities, ego is apparent. It is difficult to understand the cause of their ego. What for do they consider themselves. something special? All these things are stupid and meaningless. In Sahaja they have no meaning at all.So if you consider yourself something special, you are finished, there is nothing left in you. So its not wise to imagine yoursellf to be touch. In Hindi we call it "Aakash Tattva he attains subtle Aakasha. the Subtlety of Ether element. There is no need to activate this element. If a seeker has some problem. this element is omnipresent. It is present every where. Your attention immediately reaches where it is required It is just wonderful? It is like that: people may call it miracle, but it is not. In Sahaja a rich person (Raceszada) or some thing great. Now even the poor people sufer from ego element: dalits (Down Trodden) also suffer from it.

He tolerates to a limit and then deals so severely that I get terrified about that person. What will happen to this man? Where shall he reach? What is He doing? But Lord Shiva doesn't think all these things. He doesn't forgive evil doers. He forgives only those who are worthy of His forgiveness. He blesses those who meditate upon Him continuously. But the person who does not basically want to get improved, Lord Shiva sets him right. bhakti and on the other, fight with each other. They have different marks, Shiv bhaktas have different style to put Sandal on their foreheads and Vishnu bhaktas have different style. What is the meaning of it? Vertical application of Sandal on the forehead means that we are ascending. Alright, if you are ascending then you should be peaceful. It should be applied both ways-Vertically and Horizontally. otherwise do not apply it. It should have Its true. That's why we should be scared some meaning. It is the central path of Him.

They cannot sacrifice their comforts. They have not learnt that this modernism is beyond me to understand. These foreigners have no servants.

In olden days seekers were asked to renounce every thing to achieve the joy of Lord Shiva. First renounce, go to Himalyas, stand on one leg. You should not wear any clothes.

These sanskaras are to be pushed away, to be finished. There is no need to get in to extremities. No need to renounce home We have become slaves to the comforts just like Nawabs. What did the Nawabs achieve? Similarly our lives will be wasted if we do not come out of the clutches of the slavery. First we have to reduce the slavery and establish Shiv Tattva in our hearts. Nothing else is much important and everything: There is no need to do. Dravidi Pranyamas (controlling the breath). But one thing is a must, you have to reduce this temptation of taste. Temptations for the taste are to be gotten rid off. It is very necessary. Freedom from taste is a big achievement. People get enraged if they do not get food of their own choice. They throw away their plates, beat their servants and so on. If you make yourself insensitive to taste, then I think, many sweet shops will close down. However, what I mean to say is that the body should not be given much -beautiful and fashionable dresses etc. Whatever is available, wear it. You will lose nothing. On the contrary you will be happy that you are a contented person. Now a days the price of gas cylinders in India has been increased by Rupees Sixteen.

No mother would suggest such a thing to her children, what do I do? It is damaging the Shiv Tattva in you. If you are much absorbed in tasty food then Shiva Tattva will disappear and all the labour will be lost. It is not good to be absorbed in eating all the times. People in olden days used to observe fasts and sacrifice some thing. If you are contented increased salary, We used to pay Rupees Twenty-Twenty five to our servant. Today he gets two thousand five hundred, clothes and other facilities, yet he is complaining. When salaries are increascd so much, would not the prices increase? Salaries and prices rise with the same speed. There is a story that in Sri Lanka labours were given one gold brick a day. One person received two bricks against one day's work. He went to a barber shop then there is no need to think of food all the time nor to invite people at your place. for shave.

Its a very do all these things even now then why did you come to Sahaja Yoga? There is no Caste and creed in Sahaja Yoga. What is the caste of Lord Shiva? People with simple thing.

One had to wash ones own clothes, wash ones own plates. Every one had to take boiled food, at the most a little raw mustard oil and to think that different food should be prepared for different castes. I could never understand as to how the people draw pleasure out of it! Whats the reason Bangalis want Bangali food, Madrasis put on it. How many Hindustanis eat such a food? Most of the people ran away from the Ashram in twa-three days. You want South Indian food. Once I asked why there is no standard food in Airlines?

But without the blessings of Lord Shiva you cannot do that. So look within yourself and see love -you should not say such baseless things. There is no use of it. We should enjoy each others love and understanding. Of course, Sahaja Yogis do not fight with each other. With great love they meet each other. However, their small, small individual likings, eating and moving should be corrected a little bit. If that you are an enlightened person. Am I patient enough or not? Do I quarrel with others over small small things and find faults with them? Then definitely there is something wrong with me. Put your attention on that, only then you could be cleansed.

The way in evolutionary process a creature, in the company of the human being, learns complete devotion and loyality, shows that devotion (Bhakti) is innate in us. The seed of Bhakti is already We love others and with the power of the love, we keep on doing our duties. Shri Hanumana was very powerful. He had many divine powers in him- Navdha, that is Garima, Laghuma etc. He could be as big as he wanted to be and as sown in us. In the beginning we were not in human state. With the awakening of Bhakti we came to this level. Let us take small as an atom. He had achieved all the example of an animal.

When a human being bows before without which he will not die. Hit him in someone and regards him higher, it is the the heart. Shri Rama was a very humble person. Though he was very powerful yet he said to Lakshmana that Ravana has expression of that divine power. But when a person is respectful to his Guru then he gets blessed with the grace and power of placed my Sita in his heart, therefore, I cannot hit him in the heart. Again and the Guru. So the devotion and the power (Bhakti and Shakti) are not different things. It is again when I chop off his heads, his attention will be diverted from the heart. Only then shall I shoot him in the heart. What an example of the love of a husband for his wife! Ocean of power, how he was one.

I tell you a story which is very surprising. America bombarded certain areas of Africa where they thought terrorists had hideouts. I am telling you the story of a place where some Sahaja Yogis used to live. One of the bombs exploded there and most of the people died. But there was absolutely no damage done to Sahaja Yogis.

If this protection was not there then all the saints and religious people have accepted the God Almighty and Sahaja Yoga made yourself spiritually conscious. By this transformation you would have been finished. The rulers of the nation were so violent that they would have finished these people. But God is have become such devoted and powerful persons.

I can give you thousands of such examples that once you get your self-realization in Sahaja Yoga then no one could harm you. there with these saints and God is made of the power of Shri Ganesha and Shri Hanumana. They look to this protection. When Maha Rana Pratap, the ruler of Mewar, went to fight with the Mughals, his soldiers requested him to go back because it was difficult to defeat the formidable enemy. Maharana Pratap asked the soldiers to go back. He said that I will not budge and keep fighting because Ganas are with me. He was also a Sahaja Yogi. He told his soldiers to go avway if they wished to do so but. "I will fight with the enemy because Ganas are with me." So understand that you are protected from all sides. What should happen to a Sahaja Yogi when he gets this protection? He should become In olden times also there used to be saints and Sadhus. All were troubled and cheated. But despite all these troubles and difficulties they stuck fimly to their faith. They were also protected. They said such things that angered the rulers. They didn't hesitate to speak against the rulers and evil doers but because of the power of Shri Hanumana no one could touch them, no one could kill them. There is a beautiful story about Khawaza Nizamuddin Sahib. The emperor ordered him to come and bow before him. Hazarat Nizamuddin very patient, discreet and a fearless person. He will not be afraid of stick to his place and face the evil people. He need not do anything. Now that age has gone. You just stand boldly and the negative people will run away.

So we should think that He aware of the fact as to who stand resides within us. He controls our right side-The Pingla channel-and gives us zeal. As a result heat is generated. But his path is such that the heat (power) and devotion should go side by side. So the heat, the energy acts on right side but around us, who are our protectors, and how will you give your love and affection to the people?

DHYANA, DHAARNA AND SAMADHI
By Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi (January â€“ 1984)
I will tell you a few things about
meditation. It is my immense joy to see
all of you here from various parts of the
world. When your heart is so full, the
words are too poor to carry the intensity.
I wish you could understand that intensity
through your heart. It's all been arranged,
I think, by the Divine, that we should meet

something great should happen to all of
us. That we should achieve something

short, I will tell you first of all a few things
The first part of meditation is the Dhyana.
First when you have seeking, you put your
attention towards the object of your
worship. That is called as Dhyana. And
the Dhaarana is the one in which you put
all your effort. Concentrate all your effort.
But this is all drama for people who are
not realised. For them it's just a sort of
an acting that they do. But for a realised
soul it is a reality. So the first, the Dhyana,
you have to do. Some do it of the Form,
another of the Formless. But you are so
fortunate that the Formless has become a

someone wishes to come, may come. To
attain Shiv Tattva we should go through
