Shall I tell you something? This was quite a big lesson and has helped me.

I'm sorry, my phone went off. Does somebody want to put my bag in the hall? I don't want it to go off again. Would you mind? Thank you.

I was looking after her visa, her passport. I had to go to the High Commission a lot, and usually people knew who Mr. Srivastava was because he was Secretary General of the International Mail. And then the staff changed. I took the passport in to have it renewed—she had about four books all stuck together. And this man was so horrible. He was unbelievable. He didn't know who Mr. Srivastava was; he'd never heard of Mr. Srivastava. Anyway, to cut a long story short, he wouldn't do anything for me. I went out quickly and rang Sir C.P.'s office and told the Secretary what to do in dealing with this man. Anyway, he was a really horrible person.

I have quite a quick temper, and he just made me so angry I could have smacked his face. A few months later, I had to go again to get some visas. I got the wrong ones because it was him, and I got uptight. He gave me the wrong thing. I remember going round to Mother's house with this passport and I gave it to her. She said, "This isn't right. You've done the wrong thing here."

So I said, "Well, this man was so horrible."

She sent the family out of the room. And she said to me, "Did I give you that necklace?" I had a crummy old necklace on. I said, "No, Mother." She said, "Well, I'm glad I didn't give you that."

And then she changed her tone. She said to me, "Now, this man... you can't afford to behave like that. You're not a street woman. You've got to be very, very nice to him. 'Thank you very much. That is so kind of you.'"

So I went in again. Oh, no. And again he was horrible. I felt my gorge rising up. I thought, no, but I just kept saying, "Thank you very much. That is so kind of you." And eventually, that man became my best friend in the High Commission. He used to give me letters that they weren't allowed to take out of the High Commission for Mother to sort out.

It was a standing joke because every time I went round to Mother's house, Sir C.P. used to say, "And how is Mr. Toney? How is Mr. Toney?" And then eventually, that's what happened. It was a big lesson that if you're dealing with somebody horrible, you just have to be very nice. "Thank you very much." I've tried that many times since, and it never fails. Beautiful. That's from Mother's good advice.

Yes. Sometimes I think—it's just my experience—that what Mother says in her talks and all is so important, and you have to put it into practice.
