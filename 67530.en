Ladies and gentlemen, good evening. Ladies and gentlemen, good evening.  Seventy countries around the world know Sahaja Yoga and there are Sahaja Yoga centers in them.

Today, we have the opportunity to speak with the founder of Sahaja Yoga,  Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi. Thank you very much for giving us this interview.  Lovely.

Thank you very much for giving us this interview.

Question:  First question is, what is Sahaja Yoga?  What is Sahaja Yoga?

Shri Mataji:   Sahaja Yoga is, you can translate it as a spontaneous union  with the All-Pervading Divine Power.

Question:   To which kind of people would you think that addresses Sahaja Yoga?  Which is the audience of Sahaja Yoga, you could say?

Shri Mataji: All of them who are seeking the truth.

Question: How Sahaja Yoga can help a human being and in which levels, in which...

Shri Mataji : I mean, it's the last breakthrough of our evolution  which takes place because there's a power within us on the triangular bone. Actually, surprisingly, Greeks knew about it.  Greeks called it a sacrum, means a sacred bone.So, they were aware of it, it shows that. I don't know, everything is lost now in Greece.  So, we can't say, but they call this bone as sacrum.And in that triangular bone resides a power called, we call it Kundalini  because it is in coils, three and a half coils. And this power awakens and passes through six centers of our body.  These six centers in our body are made out of parasympathetic nervous system and this power enlightens it, integrates them  and gives them special energy of awareness.

Question: So, we can say that Sahaja Yoga has... here is a relation between Sahaja Yoga and Ancient Greece.

Shri Mataji: Of course.

Question: When could we say that Sahaja Yoga starts in the world?

Shri Mataji: In my life?

Question:  Yes.

Shri Mataji: It started in 1970.

Question: What made you start Sahaja Yoga?  What made you create Sahaja Yoga?

Shri Mataji: I won't say that. Because in our country people knew,  in many countries they knew,  in your country also they knew  that there is this power and it is to be awakened. And they used to do it one person to one person normally.  Like that we have Sufis also in Turkey and other places.  But actually what I did was to find out a way and method by which we can give our mass realization. That's my finding.

Question:  What is the difference between Sahaja Yoga  and the other kinds of Yoga?

Shri Mataji:  I mean, there are so many Yogas they talk about, I don't know.  But it's very superficial and it's just mental.Most of them are.  Even Raja Yoga that they talk of is the same. That happens within yourself. When Kundalini starts rising, then all these things they talk of  happens within yourself.  You can't do it from outside.

Question:  So, when someone practices Sahaja Yoga  it makes him change.

Shri Mataji:  Because these six centers I told you about  are responsible for our physical, mental,emotional and spiritual being  . And once they get enlightened definitely there is a change within us. We become a transformed personality.

Question: Yes.  In Greece, the official religion is   Greek Orthodox Christianity.  And most people believe in the message of Christ. What is the relationship between Sahaja Yoga and Christ? the relation of Sahaja Yoga and Christ, you could say.

Shri Mataji: Yes, it is very important, because He resides in one of our centers,  which is between the optic chiasma. And it's very important, because He's the one,  by getting Himself crucified, He opened that chakra. That is the fifth chakra within us, and it reacts very well. I mean, I should say the sixth,  because we are not considering the lowest one. But when it opens out, you see,  what happens is that this Kundalini, this power, can pierce through and go into the limbic area. From the limbic area, then it pierces through the fontanel bone area,  which gives you the actualization of baptism.  It's not just talk or this kind of thing, it's actualization.

Question:  Is it difficult to have the actualization of a Kundalini?

Shri Mataji: No, it's just the second. If the Kundalini is awakened, and it connects you to the All-Pervading Power  through your fontanel bone area.

Question: What could you say that it's a relation of Sahaja Yoga with religion?

Shri Mataji:  I mean, that way all religions are the same.You see, we have with our ignorance made them different,  we are fighting and all that. Religion is something that is our innate understanding of religiosity, you can call it.

Question: I would like to end with a question.  What is your message for the Greeks people ?

Shri Mataji: Greeks are, should I hold it also?  Not necessary. The Greeks are a very ancient culture  and they go very well with Indian culture.  But they have forgotten now their culture and are very westernized, you see, that's the problem.  Also it's happening in India.But otherwise, they had the primordial mother, Athena, they had all the things that we had in our country.So, if they can take to their old culture and to their old religion, they will be very near Sahaja Yoga.  They have lost their tradition. If they can find their traditions again  and their original culture,  as was the case with Athena,then we could say that they are very close to Sahaja Yoga.

From what I realised, Sahaja Yoga is something very simple  and very useful for the human being  but also for society. Thank you very much. We hope to see you soon in Greece.

Shri Mataji: Thank You very much. May God bless you.

Sahaja Yoga operates in 70 countries, (12:45) one of them is Greece, (12:47) in which there are centers, (12:49) both in Athens and in Volos.
