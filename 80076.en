Essence of the chakras, date and location Unknown

Sahaja Yogi: ‘Bhu’ is the Mooladhara?
Shri Mataji: ‘Bhu’ is the Mooladhara, means the Mother Earth.
Then the ‘bhuva’, made from the Mother Earth, the basement [unsure].
Then the Bhurva is the whole 'Antariksha', means the whole universe, the creation of material things. Material, like all the planets and things.
Then the third one, as I said it was, the ‘swaha’, the Nabhi, is the consumption. ‘Swaha’ is the, that is the fire thing, fire, fire principle is the consumption part. The ‘swadha’ is the sustenance, ‘swadha’. There are two things in the Nabhi Chakra. ‘Swadha’ is the food by which you sustain, the dharma. So, that are the two essences: one is ‘swaha’ by which you consume everything, like the Agni tattva, means like the fire principle. And ‘swadha’ is the principle of the water, by which you sustain.

Then, ‘Mana’. ‘Mana’ is the emotions, the centre of the Heart is ‘mana’, emotions.
Then ‘jana’ means the people, is the collectivity. So, I said all the ‘samuhi’. ‘Samuhi’ means collective, ‘jana’, that you contact people. ‘Jana’ means people.
Then ‘tapasya’. Tapasya means penance, that is Christ, to go into the penance and made out of the principle of -
Oh I'm sorry I forgot to say that ‘jana’ is made in the principle of ‘vayu’ [air], ether [akash].
[Inaudible part]
Then comes the, this is made with the ‘vayu’, means the air, the ‘mana’ is made with the air, ‘vayu’, all right?
And then comes the tapasya, is with the light, light.
And then ‘satya’, is the truth.
So, I have given the essences, I mean the nature, the essential nature of the chakras and also how it is created, from what essence it is created.
