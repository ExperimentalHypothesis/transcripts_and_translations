Twatta ki baat Day 2, New Delhi, India 16-02-1981

[English translation from Hindi]

It means that you will have to add better gurus, brother, only then you will go across.

Because who will eat the rest?

Where is his shop?

Because they ate their goods.

Now they won’t recommend to somebody, as doctors do, no.

You will go to someone, sir, that I have lost my eye; Ok, first let's examine teeth.

Then you removed all the teeth there.

Then he said that I will examine your eye, removed your eye; All done.

Later, it was known that nothing has happened to you.

Similar is the condition of these people, there is a partnership among all of them.

He said, "I only take this much, not the rest, the rest for the guru [inaudible].

Now that guru, another character sitting, has taken out the rest of the money; Came to be known that the house has been sold, the children have all been left out, they are standing on the cross roads, the poor children are begging.

When we don't use our intellect, we go to such gurus.

And in this way think that any work that is done in the name of God, God does, is a very wrong thing.

Like today one lady met us there.

So she said, "Our guru was prominent for [inaudible-of Upanishads], but here she is sitting and ringing the bell.

That we are in the refuge of the guru, we are in the refuge of the guru.

So I said, then; She said, "I'm crossed over now."

Your own certificate, your own everything.

How did you cross? ‘Beta’

I took to the refuge of the guru, I was crossed.

I said, this can not happen by coming to my shelter either.

Now I am sitting alive, your guru is dead.

But you say, "Mom! We are your refuge." And get us across.

It takes your effort, and the awakening of the Kundalini, It’s the work of transcending.

Until you cross, till then bowing your head in refuge your, Mother!

This is not going to work.

I may tell you clearly,

Until you have crossed over, till then all sayings are nonsense, useless.

That I have come your refuge, this and that.

Hey, all this is you said from your side, but

I had to come in refuge, isn’t it.

It's me who has to act, the work must be done through my hands; Unless I

As long as the work is not done with my hands, it will be a useless thing.

And let me tell you in totality that the one who is not realized, is not transcended;

The realized one has crossed over.

In it none can falsely certify, no matter you fight for it,

Quarrel, do whatever, what can I do.

If didn’t then no, and it happened then it's done; It's straightforward that we can do

hard work, but we can't transcend.

We can try all out, we can give you love; Can do all that but transcend,

you will have to get realized.

Like we can cook, we can cook great food, but if you don’t have a tongue

inside you, then we will feed when and you will understand when.

Your tongue should be awakened that it may understand what mother has made.

After all it's you who has to eat; or eating also I should do it for you.

It must be understood that the element is the same; that Guru you get only from God.

The Guru who ascends into the Supreme is the Guru, and no one else is a Guru.

All are blind, and where the blind is leading other blind, God knows.

Nothing happens with such a shrine.

Shrine gets effective only after realization; prior to that shrine is nothing.

You must have seen that I don't let anyone come to my feet without getting crossed over.

Because what can I do if you haven’t crossed over, what should I do? First realization is a must.

Yes, it is definitely there that many people do transcend while coming on feet, that’s ok.

But needs no shrine; he must come to refuge later.

When you seek shrine, then, at least, for the sake of shrine one must get realized.

There should be light, without light, what are you going to do for me?

I don't know maybe if I am too from 420, 108, how are you going to know if I am or not.

Even if I am talking nonsense, then how will you know?

I will never let you come to my feet until you have crossed over.

That is why it was forbidden not to be in captivation of anyone.

Devotion should only be in front of the one who reconciles you to God.

Unless that event happens within you, without substance, you should not believe anything.

So, I have told you about our element of security.

Tomorrow I will tell you about the rest of the elements, today has been a long day.

And I was very happy about one thing, because everyone said yesterday, tomorrow is cinema. Then no one will come, Mother! In the program.

And my father was going to London, so I came, leaving him like that.

I didn't even go to the airport! I said no, I should go, maybe, someone will come, and that's why I will come, and I am very happy that you people leaving your cinema, have come here, it means that you gave more importance to the element, and so I was very glad.

By the grace of Mother, if you all cross today, then tomorrow it will be a lot of fun, and come here with everyone tomorrow.

They want to, but I've seen that we had one girl from England, her name was Felicity, and she came here; I was speaking only in Hindi or Marathi.

When she went back to England, she lost all her vibrations, so, because I was speaking in English.

So, I said, what's the matter, and I analyzed it that when I'm speaking in English, Hindi or Marathi, it is a mantra, it's a thing that gives energy, no doubt, but when I speak in English language, especially, say, the people who understand English are, sort of, they start thinking about it and their ego starts working it out, and when ego starts working it out, you know what happens, and that's why the vibrations were much poorer, and if you want, I will speak it, if you want me to speak in English, I will, I don't mind, but the problem is this, that the more I'll speak in English, the worse it would be for vibrations.

So, I would like all of you to tell me what should I do, because Indians don't go into thought processes, you see, when I speak in Hindi, they don't go into thought processes so much.

One or two might go, but it's not a common thing, but Western people always must put everything into thought process, a machinery, you see, already working it out.

So, if you allow me, it would be better if I speak in Hindi today, is it all right?

And just try to hear it from your Sahasrara, and you'll be amazed that all your...

Chakras can be opened out, just don't try to understand it, that's the best, because it is the thought that comes afterwards.

The bijas, the seed of the thought, is the first, the primal, and whether this language or that language or any language, the seed is the same. You see, the cup is different, but the seed is the same, and the effect of the cup should not be there, it is the effect of the content of the cup which is important. And once you just try the content, you should not bother about it.

So what you should care for is the content, and not the glass or the cup in which it is being delivered. And for the people who are more worried about the cup always, it is better that they don't know the cup, they better have it, the content, it will help you, you will see that.

Just think from that angle, actually this is a very common thing, and Christine, who was also from London, she never felt such force in England. But when she came to England, and when she was moving about with Me, and I was mostly speaking in Hindi or Marathi, she's in another world now, and she's very good.

I think it also keeps your ego a little bit down. Ego is too much in English-speaking countries, that you know very well. The English language itself is very ego-orientated, I think, and it keeps your ego down. Like the other day we were coming by plane, and one of the air hostesses just announced that those who are going further to Nepal, please consult the people down. She had to say down below, she missed the below point, and everybody started laughing at her and making fun of her as if she was the greatest fool ever born.

But now, these air hostesses must be knowing at least three or four languages, plus languages of this country, while the people who are supposed to be English-speaking only know English, nothing more. And the French think they know their own language, so they don't know any other language but French.

So it is important to understand that when we have an ego-orientated personality, it is better not to listen to words, but better to have the contents without the words there. It is a better idea, it will work out better.

So again, I hope by My speech I have not again given a push to your egos by any chance. Try to keep it down, and see that this ego business, which is our enemy, absolutely it is our enemy, that we have acquired through our different systems. We know that, and so we must try to keep it down as much as we can, and you'll enjoy the Hindi speech, all right?

Now I have praised you very loudly, so whether this is true or not, it is a matter to know. This ego is no less in our human beings, we become egoistic about every useless thing. And these are such useless stuff, sticking out like this, that even though we know it's the most stupid thing, we keep doing it.

Sahaja Yoga shows you the truth, the truth that is, was, and will remain. In its case, no one can compromise, that you may say, "Come on, Mother! Why don't you just say that so that the work gets materialized? If you say this way, it will be good, say it that way; it will be good." Nothing such is true, whatever is, so it is. That will remain like this, and if you are not willing to believe the truth, you will have to suffer it.

It is not that the truth harms you, but if you let go of the truth, then you come down to untruth. And when you come down to untruth, then untruth is a harmful factor, it will hurt you. It has so happened that in Sahaja Yoga many people came, achieved heights, had big gains, got a lot; transcended many, and after that, they left Sahaja Yoga. And after that, by themselves, they came after years saying, "Mother! I've got this disease, what do I do now?" There are many such people.

They started saying that Sahaja Yoga has punished us; Sahaja Yoga did not punish. But if you are sitting under someone's umbrella and you leave him and go out, and if it rains on you, what will you say? That this shelter gave you sufferance? You only wiped off your canopy and went out. But being in Sahaja Yoga, its canopy has sheltered you; then this is its obligation upon you, instead of it being your obligation on that canopy.

This is the obligation of that canopy, a great obligation, that it sought you and kept you within its fold. And cared for your micro needs.

There are many things that are found in Sahaja Yoga. Out of that, as I told you, the prasad of Lakshmi also remains for you. And I also told you that Shri Lakshmi Ji resides in the navel chakra. The power of Shri Lakshmi resides therein; and I also told you how Lakshmi Ji is.

I told you that there is a great difference between Lakshmi Ji and those who have money. Lakshmi Ji is standing on a lotus; she has a lotus in one hand, and the other hand is the giver of shelter. Lakshmi Ji is standing on the lotus. In looks, she is quite heavy. You must have never seen Lakshmi Ji like today's beauty queens.

But her health is very good because they have a lot of water inside them. They were born out of water, were they not? The one who is born from water has to have a lot of water inside. This too has a reason: if she has water inside her, then for the movement of these chakras, there is no buffer, no hurdles in between. There is no safety left, so the presence of water in the body is necessary. And for this, there is less noise, and even then, so standing on the lotus.

As if there seems to be no word in Hindi, but one should say that she is adorned or well-balanced. And no weight is put on the lotus, and she doesn’t lay her weight on the lotus; that is, she does not put her burden on anyone. You see how much burden people put on others. Now, as if a guest has come.

And our people, especially Sahaja Yogis, sometimes do such a thing, sometimes a specialty of Hindustani Sahaja Yogis also do it. As if you have come from somewhere, now you have come to Delhi, then he will first say, "Sir, we are not getting any rest here."

And, "I can't find enough food here."

"It's not a good arrangement here."

"That arrangement is not right." Like in their house, these people look absolutely luxurious habitually. As soon as you come here, everyone knows that this thing is not right here. So-and-so is not good here. If someone comes to Mumbai, it is the same for them. It means you remain a thorn everywhere; you don’t behave like a flower. Like a thorn, you remain biting. Everywhere, everyone should feel that you have come from somewhere, you are something special.

You must have some speciality.

In this, we think that we have made our life something very important. And the man who got more money, he pretends more. The more a man is poor, the less his tantrums in their country, but as much as a man gets rich, the more his tantrums. And Lakshmi Ji, she somehow keeps standing on the lotus all the time; never says, "Bhai! I’m tired." For some time I may lay down. All the time, balancing her gorgeous body keeps standing, absolutely lightly that no one feels. This is an untarnishable example of Lakshmi. The man who has real Lakshmi never feels heavy anywhere.

Such a person, wherever he lives, his fragrance, his aroma spreads far and wide, but it’s not reflected in any of his gestures. He doesn’t show off to you. Whether you have money or you don't, or he has more money, or what you lack, he lives in such a way that no one knows when he came and how he went away.

He spends life like someone that no one knows, but mostly people with more money first boast that, "Sir, I am so rich." And if not, then at least they will keep playing strange horns on the way so that others turn and see which donkey is coming. Everything must be shown off; everything has an imitation for it. He brings all games in his name because he is wealthy. It is not a question of Lakshmi Ji. Lakshmi Ji lives in such a way, controlled and balanced, that no one knows.

Then, with one hand, they should donate; that donation also no one must know that it’s a donation. It’s just flowing, it’s going, it’s being given. No question of taking, and from the other hand, there should be shelter for those who are dependent on them. All should be blessed instead of many kicking, beating, doing this and that to their servants; not this.

Dependents, that is, those who are completely dependent on Lakshmi Ji. A complete hand looks full of boon, and they have lotuses in both hands. Lotuses are pink in color, and pink color signifies love. This pink color is a sign of their Preet; pink color represents her love. She absolutely, in her delicate petals, gives place to a creature with thorns like a whirlpool.

May come from anywhere, there remains arrangements for him to stay, all the time for him there is arrangement. I haven’t seen any such rich that on their door if anyone comes, then they say, "Good brother, you don’t have a place, come to my place, sleep here." Instead, they will keep four guards, four security personnel. Even if there is some gentleman, then they will beat him out.

So the element of Lakshmi inside us is in the naval, ‘Nabhi’ Chakra, about which I told you. It is as it is. We cannot become that element. You change everything on the outside, but that element remains as it is. Neither the element can be changed nor can you direct it, nor can you fight with it.

That element is made as such an element. If you have to stay on the element and you have to be honest, then you should know that what is true will remain the truth. You can't change that. Now, many people say, "What happened, Mother? If our money is black money, so what? Here we have built huge buildings for the poor, and we have built many temples."

And we built many temples. So the thing is that for the poor people, it is God's job to build a temple. This is man's work. What is the benefit of building a temple? That’s visible to you. Put four men there. Whatever they will extort from whoever comes, they will take and eat it and say, "Sahab, now do worship."

Temples should also have Brahmins. Brahmins, that is, those who have known Brahma, who are reborn, who are realized, are Brahmins. Nowadays, in which temple is such a Brahmin sitting? On the contrary, I see all are demons, so horrid. Absolutely monsters; Wherever you go, there is sting, beating, greed, all kinds of dirt. And inferior things except this know nothing; They, in any way, cannot be Brahmins. The real Brahmin is the one who is a realized soul; only he should be called a Brahmin, who is reborn ‘Dvij’. Now the challenge for Brahmin is if they want the uplift of Brahmins then go and tell them: Look, you are defaming the name of Brahmins.

You are not Brahmins; You cannot be Brahmin as the Brahmin is that who has attained the Brahma tatva of God, Brahma tatva is flowing within him, he only is self Brahmin and none the else; This will cause a great deal of harm to the entire caste. And all the caste will be infamous. Now, to know this element that in Lakshmi Tatwa what mistakes we commit, let me explain a little bit to you. Lakshmi element, that is all around it is spread the principle of religion; and this element of religion, the ten Gurus have bestowed on us. It is that so far we say that the main ten Gurus that we had, it does not mean that these ten Gurus that were the only happening and no one has happened; but these main Ten Gurus, in Sahaja Yoga we recognize which starting from Adi Nath.

And to Socrates. From Lautse to King Janak, Nanak, Mausa. And many such other these ten are there whom we recognize, who we believe have become immortal. Joraster, all these are the descents of the same Guru element, one of the same. Now it should be kept in mind how in the Lakshmi element, we mess in. It’s necessary why is there no Lakshmi in our country; many people ask me Ram Chandra left what vibrations in your country; Vibrations that He left must be in your Lakshmi Tatwa, you all will see the reason of it; The first reason is that wherever you have Bhoot Vidya, Phantom Vidya, Samshan Vidya.

And Tantric Vidya, if you run any of these knowledge, then Lakshmi Ji will go from there. Immediately Lakshmi ji will leave. If you run any Vidya, run Tantra Vidya; That is, any ghost knowledge, If you use any of these knowledge, then your Lakshmi power will end. As told to you, one Sahab used to visit us. He had a shop and that shop was not running at all; then I said, “Ok! Bring your wife." When he came with his wife, saw that his house-wife [Graha Lakshmi] had absolutely ghostly looks, so filthy thoughts were running inside her. I asked her whom do you visit, do you go to some tantric? She said no, not to Tantric, but he is our Guru. I Said, "Ok! What does your Guru do?" And when she told us what all he told them to do; I said Baba re Baba, he is a solid tantric and that's why the woman got in clutches. Then removed those peepers that were offered on him. After that the man flourished so much.

Flourished so much that he himself was astonished that the people who never came to our shop started coming and like this Lakshmi ji started coming. Now see where all is more poverty in your country; Kerala, I have been to; I was very surprised that in Kerala, in house only people burry all dead; Where they die, they bury them. Where is the need of going far away, buried there itself, work finished. No! the voice is coming, yes! Ok! Now, now the voice is coming, now this phantom lore and this samshan vidya. Absolutely monsters; Wherever you go, there is sting, beating, greed, all kinds of dirt. And inferior things except this know nothing; they, in any way, cannot be Brahmins. The real Brahmin is the one who is a realized soul; only he should be called a Brahmin, who is reborn ‘Dvij’. Now the challenge for Brahmin is if they want the uplift of Brahmins then go and tell them: Look, you are defaming the name of Brahmins.

You are not Brahmins; you cannot be Brahmin as the Brahmin is that who has attained the Brahma Tatva of God, Brahma Tatva is flowing within him, he only is self Brahmin and none else. This will cause a great deal of harm to the entire caste, and all the caste will be infamous. Now, to know this element that in Lakshmi Tatwa what mistakes we commit, let me explain a little bit to you. Lakshmi element, that is all around, is spread the principle of religion, and this element of religion, the ten Gurus have bestowed on us. It is that so far we say that the main ten Gurus that we had, it does not mean that these ten Gurus were the only happening and no one else has happened; but these main ten Gurus, in Sahaja Yoga, we recognize, starting from Adi Nath.

And to Socrates. From Lao Tse to King Janak, Nanak, Moses. And many such others, these ten are there whom we recognize, who we believe have become immortal. Zoroaster, all these are the descents of the same Guru element, one of the same. Now it should be kept in mind how in the Lakshmi element, we mess in. It’s necessary why is there no Lakshmi in our country; many people ask me, Ram Chandra left what vibrations in your country. Vibrations that He left must be in your Lakshmi Tatwa, you all will see the reason for it. The first reason is that wherever you have Bhoot Vidya, Phantom Vidya, Samshan Vidya.

And Tantric Vidya, if you run any of these knowledge, then Lakshmi Ji will go from there. Immediately Lakshmi Ji will leave. If you run any Vidya, run Tantra Vidya; that is, any ghost knowledge, if you use any of these knowledge, then your Lakshmi power will end. As told to you, one Sahab used to visit us.

When he came with his wife, saw that his house-wife [Graha Lakshmi] had absolutely ghostly looks, so filthy thoughts were running inside her. I asked her whom do you visit, do you go to some tantric?

And when she told us what all he told them to do, I said, "Baba re Baba, he is a solid tantric, and that's why the woman got in clutches." Then removed those peepers that were offered on him. After that the man flourished so much.

Flourished so much that he himself was astonished that the people who never came to our shop started coming, and like this, Lakshmi Ji started coming. Now see where all is more poverty in your country. Kerala, I have been to. I was very surprised that in Kerala, in house only, people bury all dead; where they die, they bury them. Where is the need of going far away, buried there itself, work finished. No! The voice is coming, yes! Ok! Now, now the voice is coming, now this phantom lore and this samshan vidya.

And there is also a difference in such death, means that the man who dies should be properly buried. Even otherwise, there is no need to bury anybody; but yes, if someone has become a saint. Saint means not that who worships and who, wearing saffron clothes, wanders here and there, not that; the one who gets realized, who is transcended; the one who has become a saint, which has transcended, is not burnt. He is never burnt.

That is called samadhi. They can be in the tomb. Here, wherever all tombs of this and that are seen. And when a man dies, who is not realized, then it is better to burn that so that all the negativities in him get cleared and in a way, he gets born once again, it becomes completely cleansed because you know that you have a special characteristic that can purify even 'Kanchan', means Gold. So such man must be burnt, straight away; but people bury him at home.

When we went there in the rural, I said, where did you bring here among ghosts? The complete cremation city is totally a cremation ground. Then asked how; I said here all dead are buried, I see. When they were asked, they said, yes! Here, since thousands of years, it's prevalent. I said, 'Aye', what you bury in home only. Then came to know that once Shankaracharya, Adi Shankaracharya, that too disciple principle.

He is a big personality, refused them that your mother, you cannot burn, you can't burn mother. Then he used banyan leaves, tree to burn his mother. Then he cursed them that you too will not get anything to burn, and in your homes only you will have to bury. But that curse became very heavy, then these people started to bury it in the house. So for the curse and the abundance of burial land, there it is difficult to eradicate poverty; though we went and tried hard there for this and made people understand not to bury in homes but outside, and here, poverty did not get eradicated.

The second thing is where humans, for laziness only, turn, poverty sets in there. Lazy people, means most lazy people are in this Bengal region. You won't find more lazy persons anywhere else. I used to think earlier that the people of Lucknow are the most lazy. When my in-laws were in Lucknow, I saw that their sun rises at 11 o’clock; what will happen to them? I am from Maharashtra, and I'm habitual of getting up at 4 am, I am from Maharashtra.

In Maharashtra, the poor people take out food from the stone, they need to labor hard with stones. There, poor people get up at four to work hard. People from UP, I have seen, are very lazy, most lazy, but when I visited Bengal, I said that such won't be found anywhere. Now that I went to London, I think that the most lazy are English people. They are the laziest people. Now in Hindi that I speak, there is no harm in telling.

You won't believe that these people wash their faces in the night itself before sleeping, and there are also those who haven't had a bath for a year. Muslims at least take a bath every Friday; they are above them. Full one year, and there, if you made someone get up in the morning at around 9/10 o’clock, then there is no sinner, wicked, demon more than you. Means that there is no sin bigger than that.

And for getting up before 10 o’clock, meaning before 12 o’clock, it's an extremely difficult thing. But for a job, what could you do? So, as you sleep in bed, get up, get into jeans, and, reaching the office, go to the bathroom, do everything there. Bathing is no question to you. Only brushing is needed, so did at night.

And Indians are just the opposite. Every morning they will bathe in the morning and will get out in that cold. After that, they may get cancer. And if asked them, "Brother, take a bath at night, brush it in the morning," "Mother, you are saying that?" I said, "Yes! Brother, I am saying the same and do like that."

Then they said, "How about you?" I said, "I don’t move out, I remain indoors." So, for me, my issue is different. Now nothing is going to happen to me, but it is fine for you in such cool winter here that you get up to take a bath in the morning. And then you should bathe in cold water. After that, you go out. Even otherwise, it is a very wrong thing to take a bath in hot water and then move out, no matter here.

One should take a bath, always take a bath with cold water. Even later on, also bathe with cold water. Then you won’t ever get cold, etc.

Now, this is a little thing, but to do that is also quite difficult for them. They are so lazy and are always so tired that now these people came here. They will keep lying the whole day long and sleep, eat the whole day. And when asked in the evening, "What, brother?" "We have got tired!" "What did you do?"

If they get tired of sleeping, then how will they be, only God knows. But laziness is also too much in our country, and so do the ways to avoid it. There are so many, more than 2500—'pachis sau'—labor-saving devices. Just ask the Bengalis.

Ask, this is the condition of Bengali people. If you want to buy something, then buy by 12 noon. See, from 12 to 3 in the afternoon, all the shops are closed. The lock is installed.

Now that I went to London, I think that the most lazy are English people. They are the laziest people. Now in Hindi that I speak, there is no harm in telling.

You won't believe that these people wash their faces in the night itself before sleeping, and there are also those who haven't had a bath for a year. Muslims at least take a bath every Friday; they are above them.

Even otherwise, it is a very wrong thing to take a bath in hot water and then move out, no matter here.

उसके बाद हमेशा ठंडे पानी से One should take a bath, always take a bath with cold water. Even later on, also bathe with cold water. Then you won’t ever get cold, etc.

Now, this is a little thing, but to do that is also quite difficult for them. They are so lazy and are always so tired that now these people came here. They will keep lying the whole day long and sleep, eat the whole day. And when asked in the evening, "What, brother?" "We have got tired!" "What did you do?"

Ask, this is the condition of Bengali people. If you want to buy something, then buy by 12 noon. See, from 12 to 3 in the afternoon, all the shops are closed. The lock is installed, and you will hear the snores from inside.

And that even up to 5 in the evening, the shops do not open. That is, from 12 o’clock to 5 o’clock, no shop opens. So, there are many such shops that do not open up to 12 o’clock, no matter what you have to buy. And the second thing is that they are so engrossed in laziness that they, for this, do not understand that there is any other world because when you are short of time, what will you see in others, what will you understand from others, what can you learn from others?

They do not know if there is also any other world. As for them, "We are the only ones." We are everything. A great region like Bengal, where such accomplishments have happened. Goddess has done so many deeds, but today tantriks have ruined it for their alms.

The tantriks have absolutely taken control over there. They have so controlled because lazy people have no other business except for going and asking about their future. Brother, when there is nothing to do, you will show your hand to know what's there. This way, great tantriks gathered there who keep on telling that this will happen to you, your father will die, then you are going to get a lot of money, and then you will have an accident, and you will have a lot of money.

And like this, such people... And for this reason, at such places, no money should be given. But what is not always earning hard. But whatever it is, hard work is always earned.

When Lakshmi ji came into the world, then you know deities and devons all labored together. Then only Lakshmi ji came into the world. Then, who don’t labor, for them Lakshmi, if at all comes, goes to waste.

As some rich accumulate money for all their children and for the sake of donations will not give a penny, not there. Buy jewels, this and that for children. When the father died, they will be busy managing to spend the least on performing the last rites. It's better to throw them in the sea. No, it's alright, gone once and for all.

Then by taking such money, all kinds of filth get addicted. Free money for no labor, if some human gets it, it's not valued, and for this, Sahaj Yoga also is not valued. Especially in Hindustan because these people do not have to work very hard, but these poor people outside need to labor very hard.

Therefore, they value it. You get it instantly as you are born on this virtuous land. Your mother is very much kind to you. Means, it's not me, your 'Bharat Bhumi'.

So you get a lot with her help, and even after that, you have no appreciation for her. This is absolutely correct.

Why are our UP people so lazy?
