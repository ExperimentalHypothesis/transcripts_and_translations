1986-1010 7-th Day of Navaratri, Shri Mahadevi Puja Pt 1 Talk, Kolkatta, 10 Oct. 1986

[English translation from Hindi]

I bow to all the devotees and seekers who have assembled here for the Puja today.  In this Kaliyuga of today, when so much devotion and homage for the Mother, and so much love comes into the hearts of human beings, then we can understand that Satya Yuga (the Age of truth) has begun. This is my good fortune also that on a Shashthi Day I came to Calcutta.  As in the shastras (scriptures) also it is written that the Mother comes to Calcutta always on Shashti day.  ‘Shashti’ Day (sixth day of Navaratri) is of Shakambari Devi; and on that day the whole nature should be covered with lush greenery.  Although I have heard that there were severe floods here, which caused great hardship to everyone; still, I see that everywhere the nature is so green.  The roads got broken, but no trees appear to have broken or uprooted.  This means that there must be some hidden and secret happenings behind whatever is done by this Creation.  The situation in Calcutta, due to many reasons, has become disturbed and impure too.  From this we should understand that it has become very necessary, and that is why Devi’s displeasure is being expressed, or we can say that a thorough cleansing has taken place.

In Calcutta, where Devi Herself has taken Her incarnation – this is Her place where the Heart Chakra of the whole world is placed. In such a sacred place, we have given importance to a lot of a-dharmic (against dharma) activities - and the worst adharmic activity is to believe in tantrics and tantrism. In reality, ‘Tantric’ is the Mother Herself because all the tantras (the essential knowledge of the workings) are in Her hands.  She is the One who created the Tantra, and all the knowledge of it's workings are within Her.  But whoever does all the adultery, indiscretion and conduct in the name of tantras, I must say that they should give up all such activities.  In Satya Yuga (the Age of Truth), there will be severe oppression and injustice against such people and such people will suffer a lot. In this city of Calcutta there are so many tantriks, so many people who have taken deeksha (initiation) from them, that how will we find a way to tell them and convince them that all this is evil and wrong things.  By doing this we can never be benefitted. This is an activity of evil forces, and they are the Rakshasas (demons) who keep taking birth again and again.  In spite of being destroyed so many times, they keep reappearing in this world and continue their evil ways, and that too in the name of God, in the name of the Devi. Our perceptions in this matter must be corrected. Because Sahaja Yoga is established on absolute truth and not on lies, and whatever is truth that I have to tell you.  If you are running toward the blazing fire to get yourselves burnt to ashes, it is My duty to tell you clearly that it is wrong, and you should not go that way.  That is why I become so anxious, and think about how to explain that if you really want to lift this land which is cursed by these people, then it is important that firstly you do not move towards them.  It seems that in their distress people think that these people will help them. But instead of help, they will cause you greater harm and damage. You should consider them as poisonous and stay away from them. Unless you start this work here in full swing and expose each one of them, this land will remain cursed.

I have incarnated here many times; but in this incarnation I am seeing that slowly and gradually it is heading towards destruction.  This land has achieved such a great height of spiritual attainment, where even the Ganges, after flowing, reached the abyss and where, through the efforts of Bhagiratha, so many of his ancestors were freed from the curse. She (Ganga) could do this work by taking the dust of this land. But many such sinful acts are happening on that holy land.  We should know that because of these very subtle things; Our Bengal has been hurt in this way. When I used to hear that a lot of political matters and government rounds are happening here, due to which a lot of conflicts have arisen among the people. They are cutting each other’s throats. This person is being beaten up, that person is being beaten up, there is no solution. Murders are happening, thefts are taking place, dacoities are taking place. So, you see it from the outside.  The root cause of all this is tantric activities.  They think themselves to be very smart by using such extremely harmful smashaan vidya (activities connected with burial grounds), preta vidya (use of dead spirits), and other extremely dangerous activities; and befooling people, extracting money from them and they introduce evil spirits and negativities into them.  Because of that negativity, one falls into a deranged state and gets entangled in that situation and becomes totally confused.  In this confusion, he becomes unable to distinguish between dharma and adharma (truth and untruth) or between good and evil. Under such circumstances, if I do not clearly tell you the truth about them, how can you be saved?  Many people have tried to advise me that “Mother, You should not talk about them so openly”. But if the Mother does not tell you, then who will? It is important for Mother to tell you all this.  Can you imagine your mother saying, “Ok son, go and put your hand in the serpent’s mouth.”  Is there anyone’s mother in India who would say, “Ok this is a snake, put your hand in it’s mouth”.   Only those who are interested in contesting an election, or want to gain something, they will speak like this, they will compromise. They will compromise.  A mother who sincerely loves her child, she can never say such things that are harmful to her children and she is not afraid of anyone.  What can these people do?  They can't do anything except catch hold of our lost children and torture them. In this way many false gurus have taken birth in this Kali Yuga. These too, have taken birth in greater numbers than those who were Mahishasura, Narakasura and all the Chandamundas that you are naming in their previous lives.   Out of these, there are sixteen main rakshasas (demons) who have come to this world.  Ravan has also made his entry.  They are all on the stage.  Now how can they be killed? The time for their destruction has come, but how to kill them?  I can take a sword in My Hands and cut them off; that’s not a difficult job. But they have entered into the hearts of common people.  They have entered into their brains.  They have all gathered inside, and are sitting there.  Common people are accepting them as gurus.  What am I to do?  Can I cut My children’s throats along with them? So, it is better that one day they will have to face defeat from the public itself.  This will be completely and clearly explained to everyone, there will be exposure and people will see and understand that every single thing that Mother used to say about them is true.

In Germany one gentleman has written against gurus, that this is such a thing that if people have one guru, then they are not prepared to accept or listen to anything else.  Now these are half baked people.  They do not know that for many years, since eternity it has been told about Gurus in our country, that it is only a Sadguru (true guru) who can unite you with God. “Sadguru wohi jo Sahib se milai”(an old proverb in Hindi). The one who unites you with God is Sadguru, then there is ‘Guru’ who talks about God and instills dharma in you. But those are ‘a-gurus’ (false master) who have no qualities of a guru (guru tattwa), and who are not even realized souls.  Still, considering themselves as Guru, they tell things to people and also might take money from them.

For instance, the priest and even the Pope, they are all a-gurus.  Their kundalini is not awakened; they have no qualities, and are talking about dharma.  In our country there are lots of people like this.  Most of our Shankaracharyas (priests) are like this.  Except for the Shankaracharya of Kanchi who is an earlier one, all the other Shankaracharyas are a-gurus.  Their Kundalini is sitting at the bottom and those whose Kundalini has not risen yet, we consider them as Guru.  Why do we accept them?  They have been elected – can there be any election for Gurus?  It should come from Paramatma (God almighty) Himself.  This is something we have to understand that this should come from God Almighty. Then after that, there are those who are called ‘Ku-guru’.  They are those people who are these Tantrik, who have demonic tendencies and are of extremely evil nature.  They profess to be gurus; and there are many such gurus whom we consider to be extremely wicked, evil, such people have become our gurus today. Nobody knows how all of them came to this Bengal, just like the Ganga reached here with all its herbs from the Himalayas, God knows from where all of them came together and settled in Bengal and made this place poor and looted the people. I know what evil deeds they have committed on this green and verdant land because you cannot see what is happening in the subtle. You are under the impression that it was the Naxalites who have done this; or the Communists; or the Congress, who have done this.  It is not the fault of any of these things.  This environment which has become polluted, it is these Tantriks, these evil people who are spoiling this environment. Even more evil and powerful demon who was said to have been killed by Devi Herself too are worshipped here by the people.  Mahishasura is still alive, and Mahishasura is also worshipped a lot here.  You have worshipped the devil who was killed by Devi herself!  Even Narakasur has been worshipped so much that you have given him money in crores (millions).  No one knows exactly how many jewels and diamonds [unclear] he has.  Such evil people have been nourished by you. Then you people will definitely become poor.  It is as if you invited this doom, by standing in front of a bull and asking it to hit yourself. You cannot understand with your intellect how evil these people are. Today on a Puja Day, as a Mother I have to tell you all this. Before the Puja it is important for all of you to know that you are your own Guru.  You don’t need to make anyone else your guru.  I am not a Guru either.  If I was, you would have been in great trouble.

But who is a greater Guru than a mother?  Mother is the mother of all the Gurus as well and if you want, you can sit at My Feet; or sit on My Lap; or even sit on My Head.  You are My children, that is a different matter.  Yet it will never be accepted that any Rakshas (demon), or what we call negative personality, can come and influence you or possess you.  If ever this happens, I will immediately warn you to give it up for which you should not feel bad.  Because I am a Mother and it is in My Nature to give you moksha (salvation).  There is nothing special in that but I do not want to cause you any kind of pain.  But if you are not told the truth, later on you will have to suffer. The truth does not seem dear in the beginning. That is why Shri Krishna has said – “Satyam vadet, Hitam vadet, Priyam vadet”.   Whatever is for your benevolence, I have to tell you because you are My own. Maybe you will be upset for a while but that doesn’t matter.  At least you will be saved and things will settle down in your brain. This is exactly the cause of the destruction of this place.  You can see them in such abundance that it is surprising how these people are still alive. These too shall be treated. But first of all, you should get out of their clutches, otherwise my hands stop. They can be collectively treated.  But you people become a fetter (confine) for Me.  Because of My love and concern for you, I am telling you that please break all your connections that you have with these people.  Get rid of any kind of their articles, like their photos or their prasad given by them which are all poisonous.

Today before the Puja what should be said? The Heart is so ‘Gadgad’ (being so full of emotions and love that it becomes hard to speak). Such beautiful compositions; such beautiful Aavahan (Invitation to bless with presence); such a beautiful welcome that all of you have done from your hearts. The Heart is completely ‘Gadgad’. It is said that “the Great Mother is ‘prasanna’ (pleased)”. But I don't know why the eyes are full of tears and the throat is also full thinking that so many of My beloved children are living here.  All your problems or calamities can be finished, all your troubles can be wiped out, because that who is Paramatma is all-powerful. Neither there is anyone more powerful than Him and nor anyone also who loves as much as He does. With such a loving and powerful God being your own, why do you need anything or fear anything? The only defeating factor is your freedom. I cannot take away your freedom. Because when it comes to giving you ‘Param’ (ultimate) freedom, then this freedom is fully respected. But in that respect itself, human beings get lost. Human beings go astray and get close to such people who are enemies of your life, they are your foes. For many thousand years, these wicked people have been tormenting these devotees and are still continuing. They have joined forces and come in camouflage so that no one can recognize them.  Even Sitaji was deceived by the disguised Ravan, and you are mere human beings. If they mislead you, it is not your fault.  But after realization, after becoming a realized soul, you should be able to stand on your own feet.  You should give up all these things, brush yourselves clean, and become absolutely pure.  Then none of your problems will stick on to you.  The power of love is the greatest, you should know that we have not used it till date; and when you begin to understand that you have been endowed with this power of love and when you start using it, you will be amazed, and you will begin to feel that the stars and planets are at your feet. All the Shaktis are around you; the Ganas are protecting you and all the angels are showering flowers upon you. You are the ones who have come to (standing on) this theatre, on this stage today. This whole creation is for you, and it is you all who are the supreme people in the universe. For whom else has God created the universe! But whatever wrong deeds have been done, whatever wrong things have happened, we have to forget them all and stand in the present time. We have to stand in this ‘present’ and enjoy that pleasure. You have to enjoy that nectar which is longing for you. God Himself desires that you should come into His ‘Darbar’ (Royal Court) and take your respective seats so that He may respect you appropriately and bestow you with all kinds of happiness. This is what a Father would want and this is what He wants and He is completely with you.

Today this greenery that we are seeing, it is a very beautifully designed garden. Understand that the ‘Garden of God’ is similar. His ‘Garden’ is full of all kinds of flowers, joy, happiness, and fragrance.  But the only thing that is required is that (you) have the ability to sit in it, and have the depth to enjoy it.  Just this much is sufficient to get everything all right. What can be said about the Lions Club here! I think in all My lives I have had some connection with lions and sitting on a lion, so much has been achieved.  That is why this connection has been made with the Lions Club!  This is a very beautiful grove and you can make this park even more beautiful.

Once an American lady asked Me, “I don’t see any flowers in Your country”.  I said, “Here in our country we have very small flowers, but they are extremely fragrant.  They are not very showy unlike the flowers you have. There is a miracle and a mantra in every flower”  So she said, “OK, tell me some varieties of the flowers which You have here.”  While sitting there, I told her the names of forty flowers and every flower has the most pleasing fragrance. Now I see that here also you need such flowers like Jasmine, Champa and Parijatak. These flowers have been described in Devi Mahatyam.  There are many kinds of such beautiful flowers. There are flowers like cape jasmine and night jasmine. There are many such flowers in our country, which grow huge branches, and in the morning if you see, the courtyard is all covered with those. You see, what we call ‘Bakul’, in U.P. (State in India), it is called ‘Maulsiri’, that tree is also very beautiful.  Its flowers are extremely fragrant.  You can also plant ‘Jaswant’ and many other such aromatic trees. I once said to a lady in Japan, “your garden is very beautiful! I like it”.  She said, “Yes, it is beautiful; but it is artificial, they are not natural.”  If you go into any garden in India, you will find intense fragrance. Fragrance is the speciality of our country, the speciality of this soil. You will be surprised that we are unable to understand that even grass has such a fragrance and everything has such a fragrance. We are not aware that in other countries, one cannot even put one's hands in the soil.  If you put your hands, you will get blisters and boils.  Because the land of that place has, due to all the sins, has become heated up. Because of that ‘heat’, it (soil) is like lime there. You can't put your hands in the soil unless you wear gloves. In London I had at first thought that I would do gardening there.  Because I am fond of Shakhambari (greenery).  So, I had a desire that I should make a garden there.  But when I saw the condition of the soil there, I gave up the idea.  I lost interest in that.  I thought I would go to India and better do this work there. This land is something else.  This land, on which you are standing, every grain of it emits fragrance.  Even after a light shower of rain, such beautiful fragrance emits out from this earth. And you also must have taken birth and settled here because of your ‘punyas’ (virtuous or meritorious acts) of your past lives.  Only you have to enlighten these virtues and manifest them to become effective, which you can do through Sahaja Yoga very easily.

Now, regarding Myself, I keep on coming and going.  To every place, I come and go.  But My love for Bengal is very old, very ancient. It is a story (connection) from several years ago, many of (these stories) you are aware of, and some you are not. Very difficult things have happened. I faced a lot of problems and made it so prosperous and made such a beautiful garden here.  And after all that (work) now I see, so much poverty, difficulties, and distress is prevailing in this place.  Wherever this bhoot vidya (black magic) is practiced, poverty will pervade there.  Now you may say we have typhoons here, and that is how we get destroyed.

Now I’m going to tell you a story. Once I went to visit Thrissur (in Kerala).  A lot of people came to welcome Me.  Very rich people live there; they brought cars etcetera.  I was surprised and wondered why they had come to meet Me.  I discovered that they were cultivating tobacco plants in that place.  Their houses were built with English tiles, and they had English (style) bathrooms. These people export tobacco to England, and from there they import all English goods and with great pride put those in their houses.  But I have to speak the truth, whether you like it or not.  So, I said, “You have come to welcome Me with all these big cars and other fancy things, and I should not be saying this.  As a guest, I should certainly not be saying this.  But, being a Mother, I have to tell you that you must stop cultivating tobacco.  It is a wrong deed.”  They said “Goodness! Mother.  If we don’t plant tobacco, what else can we grow?”  So, I said, “Plant cotton. High quality cotton shall grow here.  But don’t grow tobacco.  It is a demonic thing.  Do not cultivate it.” So, they said, “But we don’t smoke it. We send it to England”.  So, I said, “Oh! if you send it to England, there is no sin in that?”  They answered, “They troubled us a lot.  Let them consume it and die!”  I said, “Is this any solution?  Can this be the way (to act/behave) of saints and holy men?  That they should die?  They did trouble us.  But those (people) who did it are long dead and gone.  These are other people that have come.  What is the use of punishing them!”  But they were not prepared to listen or accept. And when I insisted that they must stop this; it is not right; they got very angry with Me. Afterwards, when I went around that place, I saw there was a lot of poverty there.  On one side there were the very wealthy people, and on the other side were people in dire poverty.  Even greater poverty than in Bengal. People were living on trees.  When I asked why it is like this, they told me these people practice a lot of black magic, spirits and spells in burial grounds, and this and that. They earn money through that.  I said, “what money do they earn!  They are living on trees in such bad condition.  After that I tried to convey to them in signs, “See, you are living on the shores of the ocean.  Be careful what you do.  The ocean is your Father, and this Father is the holiest person.  Sitting on the edge of the ocean, don’t do such wrong things.  If He gets angry you will be completely destroyed.”  So, they said, “How can this be!”  I said, “This will happen, you’ll see. I have warned you. After this warning if anything wrong happens then do not come and ask Me”.  That same year, one huge (the grandfather of all) typhoons hit them and destroyed everything.  They were all hanging from the trees.  Thousands of people died. After that I went to Delhi and they all came to Delhi in their big cars and asked for forgiveness. “Mother, please forgive us.”  I said, “Sons, what is there to forgive?  Whatever was there, has been lost.  What you did was wrong. I gave you a warning”. This is what I am telling you now that the warning signs are indicated here. You should remove these evil people from here. All those poor people there, who were practicing these evil spells and black magic, were seen ‘hanging from the trees. So, whenever these kinds of dark knowledge and evil deeds are practiced, they suck in. They (dark energies) attract/draw towards themselves a kind of destruction that comes from outside and destroys everything.

Although usually before My visit, these things happen; in England also, I have observed.  Wherever I go, thunder and lightning strikes, and there is heavy rainfall. After everything is cleansed out, and then I arrive. Despite all this, people do not realize that we ourselves, should do a thorough cleansing of ourselves. Why ask Nature to do it!  Sometimes it can happen that a lot of destruction may occur. That is why it is necessary for you to recognize the truth; accept the truth, and cleanse yourselves, and bring yourself on the path of truth in all purity.  Otherwise, if truth has to prove itself from the outside, it comes in terrible form.  It rises with great force, gathers momentum, and in it’s wrath it destroys even those who are helpless, unprotected, unsheltered, and sometimes, innocent people.  That is why it is better that human beings come into the path of truth, and they cleanse themselves. Rather than spreading the word in the entire Creation that now we have to finish off Calcutta and so, kill eight or ten people. There is no benefit in it either. No one understands.  No one can understand the language of Nature.  They start wondering that we go every day to the temple and do puja to the Devi, then why has this wrath come upon us.  But even in the temples of Devi, there are rakshasas sitting. They are sitting right in front of Her, sitting with great courage. However, when Devi awakens, then they will know and each one will be destroyed. Once when Ganga got awakened, all these so-called ‘Pandas’ (priests) gathered all their beds and belongings and ran away from there.  I saw all this on TV, and said “Very good!  Ganga has thrown them out!”  All of them, from Haridwar to Patna, whoever was there, they all packed their bags and ran away.  In spite of all this, human beings do not learn a lesson.  If Nature presents a remedy, he does not learn a lesson from it.  He only responds to his spirit.  So it is better for you to accept Sahaja Yoga.

There is no such disease that Sahaja Yoga cannot cure. There is no such calamity that cannot be removed. All kinds of difficulties can be resolved.  But after getting realization, you should have Shraddha [enlightened faith], which is not blind faith.  It is a thing that has been seen, you have got it. You should settle down within yourself, you should sit on your own throne.  You have received it, why are you still sitting like a beggar?  You should understand comfortably and accept the fact that you have entered into the kingdom of God, and sit on His throne.  And with His blessings, completely, without any worries, get the best of your life. I do not mean that you should become an ascetic, or that you should forfeit whatever you have. Nothing like that. But your own power of enjoyment increases. For example, you see here a beautiful cheetah skin is spread out.  Now you people must be thinking who killed it, who made it, what is this, what is that.  But as soon as I saw it, I became thoughtless.  I do not think anything.  I only see the miracle (wonderful handiwork) of the person who made it.  What a wonderful thing he has made! I do not think anything. All the joy runs from top to bottom. So, I became the ‘enjoyer’- in the real sense.  All this is made so beautifully. There is nothing to think about it; and I merely look at it. The moment I just look at the subtle power of the artist with which he has expressed this joy in it, all that joy started flowing inside Me. I did not think or try to know anything about it.  I was only enjoying the subtle artistry of the person who made it, and has put so much joy into it, I am receiving that joy within Myself.  So, you will become the enjoyer. You can get enjoyment from everything.  Till now whatever property you have it is a big thing. Whatever goods you possess, it is all a big deal. You have got it registered in insurance, registered with that person, writing it here, writing it there, making a Will, and you keep doing all sorts of things. Always worried that some burglar might take it, or you may lose it. For Myself, it may be in anyone's name, let's say, this (place) belongs to the Lions Club, but I am enjoying it fully. Whether it is in your name or in someone else’s name-  I am enjoying it fully.  In the same way you should also improve (develop) your power to enjoy. What is there to let go of something when you are not holding on to anything, what is there to give up and what is to be renounced?  This may be a bit of a stretch but it has to be said to you because you are Sahaja Yogis.  This can be only told to you.  If I say this to the general public, 50% of people will get up and run away.

Another thing to say is that you have to enjoy everything. But even further, I would say that you do not only have to enjoy but you have to live in this life, right here, with enjoyment and not run away! There is no escapism. If you come wearing saffron robes, you will lose your vibrations! Even Ravana came disguised in saffron robes. I am particularly irritated by saffron coloured clothes. Why should you become an ascetic? Don’t you have a mother? Your Mother is sitting here before you.  How dare you take ‘sanyas’! (renunciation). What can be more painful for a mother than this? If you want to hurt your mother, tell her “From tomorrow I am going to become an ascetic”.  She will say “son, take whatever you want, but please forgive me (do not do it)!”  Understand that I am your Mother.  You should also understand what will please Me, and what will cause Me pain!

Now, there is another thing.  This disease of fasting, which has been developed (introduced) into us.  It is absolutely wrong.  This conditioning that today is my Saturday fast, tomorrow is my Sunday fast. God knows on which day you eat!  If you are so fond of fasting, then do it.  God says that if Indians are so fond of fasting, let Me finish them off by starvation. Because that is what you desire, so have it. But if a child wants to hurt his mother he will say, “today I am not going to eat my food”.  Finished!  The mother’s whole day is spoiled.  The child says he will not eat.  (If)he will not eat today then, it is such a sad thing (for a mother).  As if her life is going to end.  Oh dear, what is going to happen. I can't live.  My child has not eaten food today.  She will sit all day worrying saying that my child has not eaten. She will tell the whole world, she will tell the trees, she will tell the leaves.  She will tell everyone that my son has not eaten food today. And in this country, I notice that everyone is observing a fast.   So I do not understand what should I do. How should I explain, 'Why are you doing this?' Eat comfortably and drink happily. But drinking does not mean taking it the wrong way. One should not do anything which goes against consciousness. This fasting business was introduced, so that you remain hungry, and whatever you save on food, put it in my (tantricks and all) pocket.

So, fasting is forbidden in Sahaja Yoga.  But, for some health reasons, if you have to give up eating for some time, that is ok.  And when you feel like eating, you should eat.  For example, if you are invited to someone’s house, and you do not want to eat in that person’s house, it is ok to make the excuse that you are fasting.  That is alright, and they will not force you.  If you fast like this, there is no harm.  This means that you are fasting for your own self.  You are not living under the rules of fasting.  Everything is in your own hands, you can fast whenever you want, otherwise you won't. Who is going to say that this time is like this, that time is like this. We are sitting and enjoying ourselves.  And if someone asks you to eat, if you feel like it you will eat, or if you do not, you won’t eat.  Because your attention should not be on eating. If you ask Me what I ate, then I will have to think, whether I ate it or not.  It is only when attention is on food, that person fasts. If his mind is not there, he will not fast. Because many times he fasts, he does not even know whether he fasted or ate. One should just take his attention off food. Because there is one thing about our Indian people that they are very interested in food. Even the wives are very smart, the women are very intelligent. She says, 'Let's cook such food for them so that they remain trapped in our clutches.' No matter wherever he goes, he will come running back home. Because, Indian men do not know how to cook. The women have made them such that they just cannot cook; and their attention is always on what their wives are cooking. So, the wife will impress you on this and that is why our attention remains mostly on food! But this is not so in other countries.  Like the Japanese people, they will see how the thing is made, whether it is beautiful or not. Whether it has form or not. Their attention is not on the food.  But in our culture, the main interest is in food.  What food has been cooked at home today! If anyone announces that a special dish has been made in my house, all the rest will arrive with family.  The whole neighbourhood will arrive to have that food; and because of food, women also express their love very openly.

Like, one day I asked my granddaughter “What would you like to be when you grow up?”  So, she told me, “I would like to be an airhostess, or a nurse”.  When I asked “Why”, she said, “(Nani) Grandmother, it is only in these two professions that we can offer food to others”.  So Indian women love to serve food.  This is something wonderful.  And, it doesn’t happen anywhere else.  Nowhere else! If you go to London, in three days you will lose half your weight.  The ladies there only offer boiled food. This is another quality in Indian women, that they like to make different kinds of tasty food and feed people.  Sometimes, in their love for Me, I have to bear their excessive hospitality. “Mother, with great love I have specially made Rabdi (thickened sweet milk) and brought for You”.  But my dear, I do not eat Rabdi. So, there is a beauty in our inclination towards eating and drinking. But what I am saying is that we should remove the attention from it, then you can get into that subtlety.  Like how Shri Rama ate the berries offered by Shabari. How did Shri Ram grasp the subtlety of hers?  Because inside her he saw her love, her reverence, her respect, her thoughts and he ate it with great pleasure. If this subtlety comes into us that instead of paying attention to the food, we pay attention to the feeling behind it, then we become Sahaja Yogi.

In this life I have given up all the things I used to like to eat and drink in My previous births. For instance, it is described that the Devi is very fond of Shrikhand (sweet made with hung curds).  Now I don’t eat it at all.  Also it is mentioned that the Devi likes Puranpuri (puris with sweet chickpea filling).  That too, I do not eat at all.   And I do not drink milk at all.  All the things that I liked, I have given up.  Because I have finished with it in My previous lives.  Now what is there to eat in this life? Now in this life there is so much for the bhoots to eat that I no longer have space in my stomach to eat anything else.

I am very pleased to have met all of you. As if I have been reunited with all those (devotees) who were long lost. If there can be a spiritual awakening in this Calcutta, then you will see how beautiful everything can become.  That should happen also, God Almighty is eagerly waiting to shower His blessings on you. It's just that you can handle it. Don’t feel hurt or upset with anything that I have said.  Whatever I have said, is the absolute truth.  You must graciously accept it.

My eternal blessings to all of you.
