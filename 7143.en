Talk to yogis. Peninsular Hotel in Hong Kong (China), 24 April 1994.

All right. Put your hands towards Me.

First of all, I must say I am very happy to see so many Sahaja Yogis in Hong Kong.

Hong Kong is a very materialistic place, as you know, and people are too busy, but the problems come out of that busyness. All this busy life creates lots of problems.

So I am sure there will be more coming from the last program, definitely, lots of them, and your hands will be full. So I just wanted to tell you what should we really do to achieve the maximum results.

First of all, we have to establish that we are Sahaja Yogis, we are very sober people and we have among ourselves tremendous respect and love. So one should never support an outsider who is not yet a Sahaja Yogi or who will be a Sahaja Yogi but support each other, all the time.

Do not argue among yourselves. Maybe one person may be wrong, I am not saying. But [it] is important that we should support each other, and above all, we must support the leader.

Whatever the leader says, we must listen to him. It’s very important, in Sahaja Yoga we are a collective organisation, that too a living organisation.

If somebody is not collective, he is thrown out of Sahaja Yoga. We are not very happy with such people. So you must try to put all effort to see that you are all collectively one and say the same thing.

This is very important to know.

Also there are people who may not be so good among you who can judge the vibrations, possibly. If so, you should ask your leader.

But among yourselves you should never argue, because we know that Sahaja Yoga gives you absolute truth. So others should not doubt by your behaviour that these people don’t know anything. All right?

Then second thing of Sahaja Yoga is that it is the power of love, it’s of compassion, of divine love. Must understand what is divine love is. That is the love that is the, like the sap, as I always say, that runs in the tree. It gives nourishment to the roots, then to all parts of the tree, and then it evaporates or it goes down.

Supposing it gets stuck into one flower, what will happen that the tree will die, and ultimately the flower will also die.

So our love is not limited love. Like, we love our children, all right, [we] love other children also. Everybody is absolutely in full pure love with each other.

Now, one must understand the pure love, that it is not attached to anyone, but at the same time, it is pure love. If you don’t have pure love in your heart because the culture is different, people start moving their attention and spoiling their attention.

So, so many people asked Me: “Mother, what to do?” I said: “Keep your eyes only up to three feet, so you will see beautiful things, like you will see flowers, you will see children, and nothing horrible”. So, whatever makes your attention disturbed, try to avoid. Best is to concentrate on your meditation.

For meditation in the morning you can just put your right hand towards the photograph and the left hand up there.

Then put your left hand towards the photograph... - like this.

Then left hand towards the photograph and right hand on the Mother Earth.

[It] is better to sit on the ground, in the morning.

Then, if thoughtless awareness is established by looking at the photograph, close your eyes.

Now, some people say: “Mother, my heart is not open”. All right. So you can say, looking at the Mother: “Mother, please, come in my heart.” Somebody’s Sahasrara is not open. Then you have to say: “Mother, please come in my head”. With both the hands.

Whatever portion you think in the body is not doing well, I am always available, so you can ask.

Your meditation should be good, first and foremost. If you are good Sahaja Yogis, then only others will believe you. But if you are not good Sahaja Yogis, nobody will believe you.

For so many people I have seen I am something beyond them. But Sahaja Yogis are the ones which really make them feel that “these are extraordinary people”.

Then, after that, dealing with them as I said, has to be absolutely with pure attention.

To begin with, the men should deal only with men and the women should deal only with women and no complications should come out.

Because that is the biggest blemish Sahaja Yoga can have, that they are just like ordinary people. So, you have to be careful about yourself.

Before sleeping, if you have time, you must do footsoaking. If one day you do not do it, don’t torture yourself for that, but it’s better that you do footsoaking. And in footsoaking first of all you must know what sort of a personality you have. Mostly you are right-sided, mostly.

So put [your] right hand towards the photograph, both the feet in the water with little salt and left hand like that.

But some are left-sided, some are definitely very much. They should not touch water. Two types of treatments are there.

Especially left-sided people should not soak, should not use ice.

This is all right-sided treatment.

After doing your right-sided or left-sided treatment, I would say you put both your hands towards the photograph and see for yourself how it is working out, without water, without candle.

But I would again say that right-sided people should not use candle as far as possible. This electricity is all right, you can use it.

They should not sit in the sun, they should put ice on their liver; also they can put ice here [left temple] when it is very hot, it’s very good to put ice here. Also for diabetes you can put the ice here [Shri Mataji puts her hand on Nabhi].

In Sahaja Yoga the treatment is very simple: for right-sided people very simple, and for left-sided.

Right-sided people get problems like liver, diabetes, blood cancer, kidney coagulation, that means they can’t pass urine, constipation, also asthma, heart attack – massive, and also paralysis, on the right side; so many.

Now, the left-sided people get pain all over left side; also can get all kinds of psychosomatic diseases which are not curable, like cancer, myelitis, Parkinson’s, all kinds.

But if you do your meditation every day, once in a while you may miss it, it doesn’t matter, you will immediately feel that you are completely cured and you keep good health.

That’s the only way you can grow. And try to bring the point where you are thoughtlessly aware.

The best way to be thoughtless is to say the mantra of Nirvichara. That’s very important. And secondly, to go on for forgiving: “I forgive everyone, I forgive everyone” so the thoughts will stop. That is the time when you are in the present. That is the time really you will grow in spirituality.

We have people in India and abroad who have become such powerful Sahaja Yogis that just by prayer they can achieve lot of things.

We are not here to destroy anyone or to torture anyone: we are here to help everyone, to make them joyous.

So one should not talk loudly, sharply, never. And show your compassion.

Now supposing somebody has some problem: we should not suddenly say: “You are a bhut”, no.

“What’s your problem? Oh, you are left-sided”. “What’s your problem? You are right-sided”. “All right, it can be cured. I was like this”.

If you say, they won’t feel hurt. “I was like you. You will be cured. Don’t worry”.

So we have to understand that we have to be extremely careful as to what kind of words we are using, and what kind of things we are doing in their presence.

Some people are extremely fast, they will walk fast and they will be handling things with such a funny gestures that people will be frightened. You should not be such. What you have to do is to see that whatever actions you take, you talk to them or do, do it in a gentle way; that’s very important to be gentle and kind to them.

Also you’ll get people who will have bhuts, who will have gurus on their heads, like the other day that lady was arguing with Me.

Try to convince [them] and tell if the - you know now who are real and who are unreal. If you don’t know, ask your leader. You better tell them that, “This is not going to help you, it has not helped you, so you have to give up.” And I’m sure they’ll agree.

I’m very sure they’ll agree. Because the way other day that Sindhi lady, she was arguing with me. And she said that, “We get Vibhutis [ndt. Sacred ash] in all centers.” I said: “This is all bhuta vidya, preta vidya and smashana vidya. What do you get out of the vibhuti that comes in, what is so great?” All these things are just to mislead you.

So tell them firmly, but with full attention, that you are trying to help them. If you want to help them then you cannot afford to be rude to them, in no way.

It is sometimes difficult to handle some people who start arguing, so best is not to argue.

Tell them: “By argument we cannot convince you. It is not in the mind, it is beyond the mind.”

Up to a point it’s all right, after that you should give up: “All right, I’m sorry.”

Then your relationships in your family should be good. You can’t have Sahaja Yoga if there is no understanding between you, your wife, your children.

We have to show that family is very important in Sahaja Yoga, extremely important, and children are even more important. You see how much we have done for the children now, we have got schools, this, that, is a very big responsibility.

So we must understand what is the responsibility. We should not spoil the children. We should appreciate whatever good they are doing, whatever nice things they are doing.

But if they do anything wrong, you must tell them, “You are Sahaja Yogis and you can’t do like this.” That you have to tell them, whatever it is, you have to tell them.

If the children are very thin, then understand they have got liver. So liver should be treated.

And next time when you come to India we are going to get you all the medicines of liver.

If they are very fat, then they are left-sided.

Try to bring them to the centre with the three candle treatment.

But first of all, test it what is the situation. Sometimes they develop a puffy fat, [that] is all right, but they become all right. So that is how you should look after their health.

Then also look after their behaviour.

Tell them how to behave. As I have seen in the West the children are not properly brought up because the parents neglect them, I won’t blame the children.

Parents neglect them. You should be loving, kind - at the same time you must tell them what is discipline is. It is very important.

Then keep a-watch on them: How they are, what they are doing. Of course, we have a school, but it has limited seats there. Whatever it is, they are going to adjust as many as possible.

Even then supposing you have any problem, don’t go arbitrarily into it. You may ask your leader or you may write to Me and inform Me.

Among you somebody might become very ego-oriented, may start his own organisation, “I will do this.”

Let him say: “You get out” and he will suffer.

You do not have to worry. “All right, you get out.” Anybody who is arbitrary will not work out. Supposing one finger starts acting more than the rest – that means there is cancer, this is malignancy. So we can’t have malignancy.

All of you should work together with understanding, before others as well as among yourselves. It is very important to understand.

Now, Sahaja Yoga has worked out in so many countries. In such a big way in some, in such a small way in some.

But wherever it is, Sahaja Yogis have to be something special. Even the children have to be something special. You have any other problem which you do not want to discuss, with, say, with your leader, then you can write to Me directly, no harm.

Either, if I answer well and good, if I do not answer also well and good, it will work out. But attention should not be all the time about yourself: me, my family, my children, my house, my job, no.

As soon as your attention is on other people, it works out faster, it helps you very much.

But on yourself: “I am sick. I have this problem, that problem”, nothing.

You are now at a stage when you can absolutely solve all the problems, but first and foremost thing: if your attention is on yourself, it won’t work out.

Attention should be on others. And if it has to be on yourself, attention, then just find out: “What’s wrong with me?”

But some people in that also go too far. “Mother, my Agnya is catching. Mother, my this is catching...” [it] is nothing, [it] is nonsense. Maybe you are catching from other people, possible.

There are some nice books, now already in Sahaja Yoga translated in Chinese, luckily, and also My tapes could be translated also.

But you have to keep My voice, as I told you, because that is mantra, isn’t it?

And you can have subtitles, would be better if you could do it. But it’s a very good idea that you can have subtitles, really. Specially for Russians if they could do in Russia.

Now, [if] you have any questions, now you can ask Me.

So it should be always like, if you are Chinese, then you should not only deal with Chinese. They should all come to the collective.

Supposing you are Indians, you should not only deal with the Indians, but they should come to the collective.

Because unless and until they come to the collective [they] will not know what the problem is. It’s not that you can organise separately a group, another group separately. It has to be one group. Of course, you could have two ashrams or three ashrams, makes no difference.

Any other question?

Sahaja Yogi: Is the camphor treatment good for left side?

Shri Mataji: What?

Sahaja Yogi: Camphor ...

Sahaja Yogi 2: Camphor treatment.

Sahaja Yogi 2: The camphor treatment. He is asking if the camphor treatment is good for left side.

Shri Mataji: What?

Sahaja Yogi 2: The camphor.

Shri Mataji: No no no no. No need. Camphor, only once in a while. Don’t do camphor. But you have done all mixed up things, you see, just do left-sided treatment, then you will be all right. Just mixed up.

And you cannot earn money in the name of God or Divine work, that’s one thing. You cannot organise like that. No, never. Because once you start getting it, left-sided bhuts will come into you.

Sahaja Yogi: I’ve never done that.

Shri Mataji: That is the part of Sahaja Yoga. We cannot.

Also if you have any guru’s photographs and all that, it’s better to put them in the sea.

Because this keeping any photograph, any book about them creates problems. So religiously search it out and put them in the sea.

[Video interrupts brieftly]

No no no no no no. No no no no. Don’t do all that. They will work on the photograph. If you want to help somebody, you see, some other people who have come, whom you want to raise, don’t touch them. Take a bandhan yourself and give them a bandhan. Put them before the photograph and you just raise the Kundalini. But be careful. Because you are still, you see, not that sort of thing that you cannot catch, you might catch.

So among yourselves also you should not do that. Don’t touch. If somebody says, “I have this problem”, all right, put him on the photograph, take a bandhan yourself, ask him to take a bandhan, you also give a bandhan and then raise the Kundalini. Be careful.

Even if there is somebody who has come now who is a sick man. So you can give them a photograph, [it] is all right, if they are willing to do it. But somebody in his family is willing to take Sahaja Yoga, who is a healthy person, he should bring. Otherwise don’t get after sick. You will have many sick, in thousands, to begin with. Don’t worry about sick.

Or if they are sick tell them to take the photograph and work it out, if they are left-sided or right-sided. Then the faith grows, they improve. But you don’t touch the sick. No, no, not at all. We are not here to cure the sick, but we are here to give realisation.

May God bless you.

Sahaja Yogi: Shri Mataji, for technique, if you have a problem on one side, you have imbalance and if the left side is weak or caught up, do you raise the Kundalini on this side and give a bandhan to the other side? Correct?

Shri Mataji: Yes. Supposing you are right-sided, then you have to put down the right side, remember that way, it’s much better. So then you raise your left side and put the right side down, if you have right-side problem.

Now, if you have a left-side problem, so you have to put down the left side. It’s easier to remember this way. So there is no confusion.

But tying up of Kundalini should be done after you have moved out left to right or right to left, whichever way. Then raise your Kundalini and tie up and take a bandhan, it’s the best way.

I would request you, all of you, to take a photograph of yours and make an album, write it down below that: what is your name, date of birth and of Self-realisation. Send it over to Me. Because I go on seeing them sometimes, you see. So I’ll know you better and also I’ll have My attention on you. Of the children as well as of bigger people.

So I’ll talk to you and talk to him because you have little individual problems, both of you.

What about you? Are you reconciled? I’m going to get, you see, this one, Werner, to task. He came here to do Sahaja Yoga and not to disturb a family. He’s been very wrong. I’m going to be very angry with him. He is an old Sahaja Yogi, he should have behaved himself.

It’s not - never to disturb a family. You have such sweet beautiful children. I will never support you in nonsense, I must tell you. And your husband is a very good man. If you behave all right he’ll come round to Sahaja Yoga, I’m sure.

You cannot be a Sahaja Yogi if you have no dharma, “shield” as Buddha has called it. It’s what we call as your character.

Your morality is the most important in Sahaja Yoga. If you are not moral, it has no meaning at all. What we need is morality today.

This is happening everywhere, nonsense.

We have to imbibe it in ourselves and we have to generate it for others also.

Whole world is full of immoral people. A very, very few who are standing for morality.

That is the greatest ornament we have.

All right? Don’t go astray. This will never help you.

It was very wrong of you and also for your children. Now go back and behave yourself properly, otherwise you cannot be in Sahaja Yoga.

Ha, if there was something wrong, then it’s all right. We have divorce in Sahaja Yoga. We allow people to divorce. But there should be substantial reason for that.

“Or to sub thik hai” [Is everything all right?] What are we to do? That will do? All right.

Sahaja Yogi: Thank You, Mother.

Shri Mataji: May God Bless you all.

I am sorry you had to come so late in the night [Shri Mataji laughs].

Sahaja Yogi: Mother, we have a small gift for You.

Shri Mataji: Why, you’ve done so much!

Oh. Where is the children’s this thing, presents? My God, a small present, is it?

Sahaja Yogi: It’s very small.

[Shri Mataji laughs, yogis laugh]

Shri Mataji: All right, what is this? This is supposed to be small, is it? From what angle?

Sahaja Yogi: It’s just a big box!

Shri Mataji: Oh, I see. [Laughing] Ah. So now. What is that? Let’s see. My goodness.

[A small red statue] This is the one for what?

Sahaja Yogis: Confucius.

Sahaja Yogis: Confucius. Guru.

Shri Mataji: Confucius! He too has... you see?

[Sahaja Yogis laugh]

Sahaja Yogi: A stick.

Shri Mataji: Fine, such an expensive one.

Great. It’s very well done. Is it written here Confucius?

Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

Shri Mataji: All right. Thank you very much. But you’ll have to bring it to India when you come. [Sahaja Yogi: “Yes, Shri Mataji”.]

But such an expensive thing, you should not have bought it.

Sahaja Yogi: Very good price, Mother.

Shri Mataji: Really? [Laughter] What is this?

Sahaja Yogi: [Offering a statue] This is Lao-Zi.

Sahaja Yogi: Lao-Zi.

Sahaja Yogini: Lao-Tse.

Sahaja Yogi: Lao-Tse.

Shri Mataji: This is Lao-Tse? Nice! [She watches the statue attentively] All right. He’s great I must say, Lao-Tse. Beautiful. He’s sitting on the clouds. Beautiful. [Sahaja Yogini: “Wow”.] Good.

This is His vahana. This is the one, is...

Sahaja Yogi: Vehicle.

Shri Mataji: Vahana, you know, this vahana is ...

Sahaja Yogi: Vehicle, isn’t it? Vehicle?

Shri Mataji: Conveyance.

Sahaja Yogi: Conveyance, yes.

Sahaja Yogini: Conveyance, yes.

Shri Mataji: Beautifully done. Thank you very much, thank you. Is written here?

Sahaja Yogi: This is Lao-Tse.

Shri Mataji: Thank you very much.

This shows the little boy is controlling. (Unclear)

This is what?

[Inaudible comments – Sahaja Yogis and Yoginis show an embroidered cloth. Sahaja Yogini: “This is a cloth, and yes, a...”. Sahaja Yogi: “A Goddess”. Sahaja Yogini: “A Goddess...”.]

Shri Mataji: Who is that?

Sahaja Yogi: Is a Goddess.

Sahaja Yogi: Goddess. Goddess. She is from China.

Shri Mataji: Goddess.

Sahaja Yogis and Yoginis: From China. Yes. A Goddess.

Shri Mataji: Saraswati.

[Indistinct comments]

Shri Mataji: Ah, it looks like Saraswati. Very Indian silk. [Laughter]

Sahaja Yogi: Yes, we had this picture when Buddhism first came...

Sahaja Yogi: We had this kind of picture when Buddhism first came to China.

Shri Mataji: Oh, I see. Buddhism didn’t talk of women. Beautiful, very beautiful. Thank you very much, thank you. Beautiful. Very well done.

These two books he gave Me, where are they? All right. You can keep them – please keep it somewhere.

Now what is that?

Sahaja Yogini: From Vietnam.

Sahaja Yogini: Yes, it’s from Vietnam.

Sahaja Yogi: From Vietnam.

Shri Mataji: From Vietnam?

Sahaja Yogi: Vietnam.

Sahaja Yogini: Yes, from Malaysia collective.

Shri Mataji: You are from Vietnam?

Sahaja Yogini: Yes.

Shri Mataji: Really?

Sahaja Yogini: Yes.

Shri Mataji: One place I’ve not been to is Vietnam. But [to] Korea I’ve been - South Korea I’ve been. [Sahaja Yogini (not clearly audible): “Lacquer and sewing”] Oh, they make these in Vietnam?

Sahaja Yogini: Yes.

Sahaja Yogi: It’s a beautiful thing through sewing. (Unclear)

Shri Mataji: It’s beautiful. Is a painting?

Sahaja Yogis: It’s a lacquer. Lacquer work.

Shri Mataji: Lacquer work. Thank you very much. So beautiful. Such a big lacquer work I’ve never seen. Must be very expensive.

Sahaja Yogini: We got it quite at a good price.

Shri Mataji: Very beautiful. Thank you very much. You want to take? Too close. [Sahaja Yogini wants to take a picture of the work. Sahaja Yogi: “That’s we can take later.”] I’ll hold it. [Shri Mataji takes the frame and holds it for the Yogis to take the picture]. Very beautiful. Oh, thank you. All this has to come when you come to Ganapatipule.

Sahaja Yogi: Actually, I would have loved one Chinese to come this time. I’ll have to get lot more to carry all these things [laughing].

Shri Mataji: See, what I was saying, for all the people from the East, there’s a concession they offer and it’s much cheaper.

I think what you can carry is quite a lot but I don't know, they told Me... I don't know how much – quite a bit [not clearly audible].

So I think they can come, Chinese.

At least Ganapatipule.

I've no idea, I'll ask them. Last time who went on the tour from here? Complete tour - was a complete.

Sahaja Yogi: Well, I was on the 11th of December.

[Indistinct conversation follows]

Shri Mataji: This is for children. [Shri Mataji takes a bag and starts taking out books Herself and hands them to children] Now. So we’ll have boys first, come along.

May God bless you.

Now you have to write poems in this, all right? You move forward. Is there any other boy?

Come along. You must write poems.

Thank you. Come along. You are a boy also! [Laughter] Kuber, come along. [Shri Mataji points at a small boy. The small boy goes to Shri Mataji and takes the book and hands an envelope to Her. Laughter] He has done a painting for Me. [Laughter]

Now for the girls.

[Shri Mataji opens the envelope given by the small boy] He’s done a beautiful painting today, you see? Did you do this one?

Child: Yes.

Shri Mataji: Thank you. Good. Thank you.

[Conversation aside with a yogi] Where is that tea set we had bought? Did you get it? [Sahaja Yogi: “Yes. Tea seats were at the back, yes, two. There were two tea sets, Mother. I took the small one. The small one”.] Let it be now, you took only one so will be a problem. All right.

Who will get? I was thinking of dolls.

All right, for the girls. [Shri Mataji gives a small to book to a girl] Now. You write poems. [Laughter] All right. Come along.

You want - which one you want? All right? Who else? All the girls.

[A girl hands an envelope to Shri Mataji]

Ah. Yes, good. Very wise. Thank you.

Just... [To another girl] Which one? All right.

[Aside to a girl] Did you get one?

Girl: No, it’s ok.

Shri Mataji: Is it all right?

Girl: It’s all right.

Shri Mataji: Very sweet.

Girl: They need it...

Boy: They need it more than you.

Shri Mataji: Ah? [Aside to the Sahaja Yogi] We could give her that tea set, and all that, so we have. Can you find that?

Girl: Thank you, Mataji.

Shri Mataji: May God bless you.

[Somebody takes a box to Shri Mataji and She hands it to the girl]

All right, come along, you are lucky. Quite heavy. May God bless you.

Girl: Thank you very much.

Shri Mataji: Thank you, thank you.

Girl: Thank you.

Shri Mataji: You got it, Rishi?

Sahaja Yogi: Such cool vibrations. [Unclear]

[Indistinct conversation]

Shri Mataji: All right, Soma is better now?

Sahaja Yogi: Yes, it has improved...

Shri Mataji: Better, yes.

Sahaja Yogi: ... since she came to Sahaja Yoga.

Girl: Thank you very much, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: Next time I would like to see your poems. All right? Kuber, you too. [Laughter]

And also nice drawings. Where is the drawing gone of Kuber? This I want to take with Me. It’s refreshing.

All right. May God bless you. May God bless you.

Look after yourself. And know that you are Sahaja Yogis, is a very big position, you are saints. Special people. You are the foundation.

Anyway I may go to mainland China and talk to the... Let’s see if Prime Minister listens to Me. May be.

May God bless you.

Sahaja Yogis: Thank you, Mother.

Shri Mataji: It’s all right.

Sahaja Yogi: Thank You Mother, for coming to Hong Kong...

Shri Mataji: Wah-wah.

Sahaja Yogi: ...and blessing us all.

Shri Mataji: You just wait and - you just wait. [Sahaja Yogi: “OK”.] Then I will go and talk to him. May God bless you.

And I think people are very simple, very simple people in North Korea. You are South-Korean?

Sahaja Yogini: Yes.

Shri Mataji: Ah, I went to South Korea, I’m sorry, not North, South Korea.

But you see, still they have no idea of a spiritual life. No idea. So, you go there quite often?

Sahaja Yogini: Yes, tomorrow I’ll go there.

Shri Mataji: She goes to... She goes...

Sahaja Yogini 2: She is my sister who came here today.

Shri Mataji: So start talking about Sahaja Yoga. All right?

Sahaja Yogini: Yes. It’s the first time...

Shri Mataji: No, no, you can do it. So have programme, or something. And get more people here from South Korea. And send them over. You can do very well. Too much American influence.

[Sahaja Yogini: “Right”.] That’s the problem. And also then I saw one programme they had invited us to, supposed to be a very special one.

And we were sitting on the top from the galleries, you see, for VIPs and downstairs, and I’ve never seen such a show.

Very dirty show they showed. Very dirty.

I’ve never seen. And CP was wearing his glasses and he just closed his eyes, and I had to, said it, “Close your eyes, you can’t bear it”. And both of us vomited.

Leave show. I’ve never seen such a dirt anywhere.

You know, I mean, can’t imagine how they have taken these things from these stupid Americans.

You can work it out, all right?

May God bless you.

Sahaja Yoginis: Thank You, Mother.

Shri Mataji: We have to think of our countries, we have to save them. Don’t you think so? It’s very important, to save your own country. Just I give you all the powers.

May God bless you.

First grow in Sahaja Yoga, first grow in Sahaja Yoga, these people can also come sometimes. We can send some other people.

We could have programmes. All right?

May God bless you.

Sahaja Yogini: Are You going to come to Korea again?

Sahaja Yogini: Are You going to come to Korea again, another time?

Sahaja Yogi: She is asking if You are you going to come to Korea.

Shri Mataji: [Laughing] Anyone at this time - I’m so busy now, I don’t know. Keeping Me too busy. That’s all right, I think it will work out.

These people can go and work it out. All right?

Sahaja Yogini: Thank you.

Shri Mataji: May God bless you.

Sahaja Yogini: Thank you.

Shri Mataji: So, are you feeling better now, with him? You have Ekadasha, you know?

Sahaja Yogini: Yes, I know.

Shri Mataji: Ekadasha means beginning of cancer, do you know? Don’t struggle anymore. You know, no mother can live without children.

See, all this is a temporary sort of infatuation, finished, is this. Mother is a mother.

How she stands, you know, for her children. All right? That’s more important. [End of tape]
