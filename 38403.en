26th October 1977 Workshop with new people after first Caxton Hall meeting, Finchley Ashram

Shri Mataji: Have they become beast or worst than the beast, even beast don't do like that. I could not imagine this is worst than prostitution I mean a horrid, it is hell, what else is the hell. No family is safe, nobody is safe, no place is safe, on top of that why do you need Rajnish to teach you all this. He is nowhere compared to many other people who are here. He doesn't know all the tricks of the trick as you people know, some of you. In Paris, you will be surprised, I have never told you this I don't think if I have told you or not.

Seeker: Paris is a dirty place.

Shri Mataji: It is hell personified. I don't know... I don't know what they are going to become, a word to call them dogs and bitches, animals and bulls in a state that's lunatic, that's how they are terrible and all of them becoming impotent there, all kinds of diseases and horrid people, very bad vibrations in Paris. There is nothing beautiful, there is no pure relationship. Now, supposing you come to my house, you stay with me, and you carry on with my daughters. Now they are married, you spoil their lives, you carry with them, it's like one train shunting another. All the Paris they are shunting everyone. How can the children be looked after, how can anybody be looked after, you see there are certain rules and regulations made for the society to exist in a proper manner. You must have a wife, you must have a husband, you must love each other, despite whatever is the problem and then you must have children, you must love your children and teach them. That's how our society is going to move about. Not like this what you call them anarchic people. This is anarchy... This is an anarchic society. There is no system at all left. Our house owner, we went to him just to take that house on rent. Firstly he tells us I am already separated I looked at him and said it's very sad to hear of you, in my presence he was feeling even worse, he is a very shameless fellow, he's already been separated he could see in my eyes and in my language he could see that I am very disappointed. We don't say it like that. It's not a very great thing to be separated or anything. Why should I say like that, I mean to that I hate itself, is the dirtiest word in the language. How can you say that I mean it's a fun thing to say I hate you. I don't know its something funny, is it? Only dirty people can hate, I mean it's not a good thing to say I hate you, but it's very common. As if I hate you means as if you are something an angel and the other is something very bad. All these small small things have come up, never we used to say Rajnish people never used to say I felt it. Now what went bad here is they never talk like that they were sensible people, now foolishly they have started talking like this I hate you I will kill you these are the worst. Never say, this is worst than abusing someone. I mean you never say like that to anyone, you are crossing all the limits of decency and decorum. Pathetic, I mean it's satanic. Its only devils must be saying these things and children, pick it up and they say I hate you, How can you, even an animal doesn't say that it will bark but it won't say that. I mean you do it and you say it shamelessly, so shameless you know by saying I hate you, you think you are very great. This is the worst part of the whole joke. I hate him or I hate her, that stinking filth. What are you, are you stagnated being, what are you... You should be like a flower, fragrant, beautiful, this fragrance. Anybody who sees you should feel the fragrance coming and you should enjoy the fragrance of others. That's what you are made to be, isn't it? And what are we doing here? This is what it is. That is what love is. That's what the face you are. I mean just relax but you think of sanity and bring sanity, you young people can do it bring some sanity, your elder people are fanatics they have other ideas they are materialistic. You have given that and you are understanding life better now, but then you have taken to another filth from one to another from one hell to another hell. This is equally condemnable the way you are changing your conduct with others. How can you do it I don't understand no human beings can do it everybody has become polyandrous animals or polygamous animals. How many animals have polygamous or polyandrous, it's very difficult to become... even at the peak of the stage there is not any polyandry or polygamy.

Seeker: Mother Muslims have four wives. Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: Muslims have wives, is it? There is a point sanity part to it. At that time when Mohammed Sahab was there, a foreigner group has invaded a big group, they called it a plan or whatever you may call, and this one was hit all the times and many men were killed because they use to go on wars and people use to attack them. It was a different style of spreading the religion because at that time they couldn't even exist, even Mohammed Sahab was poisoned. Many a time he was attacked, so they had to defend themselves and many men were killed, but very few men were left and many women were there. So Mohammed Sahab said under such circumstances one man can marry four women because he can accept that he can satisfy them, but there are so many rules and regulations with that marriage. Apart from that, it should be a marriage, it has to be a marriage, because of the abnormal conditions of those days, they had to be like that. That's not so today's condition where men and women have to be like that. So the women are marrying women and men are marrying men(Laughing). All silly people will laugh. How are you?

Seeker: Very better.

Shri Mataji: Very good. So all done? Corrected? Finished? Seeker: Yes.

Shri Mataji: You must have taken it from someone.

Seeker: Yes I think so.

Shri Mataji: You do, sometimes you meet people there and you must have got it. Clear everything? (Name unclear) Is everything cleared out? Alright? You were controlling the avadhuta on top of this and I was smiling that this was the arrangement done by my tactful son.

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Seeker: Yes as soon as I had he said, "Come we are going to the welcoming." (Laughing)

Shri Mataji: He was managing the whole place, you see very urgent it was. How are you? Come along.

Shri Mataji: Take all this William. Come along. Now, whose is this one?

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: He himself was telling me the other day one of the gurus what they did. He's already doing some magic, you could see its wrong. What I don't understand when they go to hell, or whatever you may have, but they spoil your kundalini that's the trick I don't like. If they spoil your Kundalini, how am I going to give you realization, how am I going to achieve for which you have been searching for years together for ages together for lives together and now if they spoil your kundalini what am I to do. His kundalini is spoilt poor Charlie he's an innocent person and awakened person. His kundalini was spoilt by his Kuguru. This is a very simple thing ready for you, it's already awakened for those of you are searching all here has become arrangement. Alex, you are great as your name is you are great, and now you have to take it further. As they say, a life is not enlightened to put under the bed but on top of it, I would say even more than that, it has to be a torch which has to walk in front enlightening others because we know what is the condition today. Everywhere, if you are a real Englishmen if you really love your country then you have to save it. Otherwise, this is the fall, this is the fall and this is coming up it's precariously close. You have to save all the young. Drugs have started like that, all sorts of things have started in this country, nothing is left off. 1965 was not that bad when I have first come, but just imagine what is the situation.

Seeker: Shri Mataji do know the name Shiv Puri Baba? Do you know Shiv Puri Baba?

Shri Mataji: I have heard about him.

Seeker: How is he? S

Shri Mataji: I don't say... you find out...I don't feel to tell a lie. Can you feel Nabhi on the left catch in your hand? Nabhi on the left, the basics itself is a flaw, none of them are. There are some great saints in India no doubt I would say Gaganghad Maharaj is one of them. There is one at Pondicherry, I haven't seen Pondicherry but he knows about me. He was telling to people that She has come. I met three people in Haridwar. I don't know if you have gone there, they came down from the Himalayas very old people, they knew I was there. They came and told me we first of all go and hang up there Mother, we will come later to earth, that's all. We will come later. They are all waiting. I don't know when will they come. I said I am going to put a pickle out of you. What are you going to do? Even Gaganghad Maharaj they know very well he was very nice of course I mean he was very great and he's John-The Baptist. He told people about me and he gives the water most of the time, tying them all sorts of things because they are like there they sit in dark away from the people who have no sense and then he told me that why are you giving them realization to every dick, tom and harry, what have they done, we have worked for hours together, we have worked for years together, we have worked for ages together, who are they, why are you giving them realization. I got these vibrations after twenty-one thousand he says, because I was a frog since then I have been taking God's name and then I got it and these people just like that you are giving them such fantastic thing. Why don't you ask them, he said how many of them are going to give life for you. I said I don't want them to give life. So I couldn't laugh. I told him you people you see trying to show your chivalry and greatness and later you thought you have done it, you cannot do it. It was the grace of God which did it, that time also when you got your realization. Of course, you cleansed yourself fast you did everything, it would be something like walking from here you can get it, but if I can make cars I can give you cars or I can take you with me where ever you say, but you people tried to walk down alright you did it, so many of you fell down, you should have waited but you wanted to show your chivalry and greatness, but there are many who just remembered God and got it. There was no need for you to show all this chivalry and your greatness, in your innocence you could do it. So people like Nanaka, Kabira, all these got just like that. Of course, he said, "Mother you are great you are boundless I don't know whatever it is but he said after twelve years I will come back.", what is it. He is the one who has written that you have seen the Patrick.

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: Did you get the booklet? No.

Seekers discussing among themselves which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: You have got Patrick also? I hope you haven't lost it. Gaganghad Maharaj you know they are very cruel you know very hard-hearted, I will never send anybody to them. There was one man he told me if somebody troubles you then you send him over to me. So I told him, you go and see Maharaj he has called you, you see. So I sent him. You have got it with you?

Seeker: Yes Shri Mataji.

Seeker: The question is unclear.

Shri Mataji: Yurin you have to look after him, he's your style, he has been everywhere and he has suffered a lot. So you have to look after him. Alright. Come here in front and sit, come on your knees, come on your knees put your both the hands open. I feel sorry for him because he's an amazing person, he spoiled. That day did you see your sensitivity will improve and it will improve you. So its better see, come, you too now its better be cool, so it's better now. Did you see do you feel any cool breeze?

Seeker: Mother I don't know.

Shri Mataji: Just start seeing that then you will understand. Come along you come and have you please see them. Just put your hands like this and just see. Do you feel any cool breeze? First, you put hands towards me that's better.

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: What? Feeling anything?

Seeker: Right hand.

Shri Mataji: Right hand not in the Left. This is because of the Sufi business, on the left, you are lost, you see our left side is that. You can feel. Now see it's coming. See? You cannot do Sufism, you have to be, you see the difference between the two, you have to be, you can't do it, you cannot achieve it, it has to be. You cannot say. For example, a dog cannot become a human being, you can say like that, something. It's okay it's better. Between the two hands, you will find this is more light than this hand, even apparently you can see with your eyes. This is more light than this hand and when my hand will be moving what it will do more light to this hand, see, seethrough me, see lighter will be your hand, see. (Laughing) See so many truths are amazing, even to reveal that as such as so is amazing and we take it for granted, you see this is something we have never seen that's why. Its nothing so great, nothing so great, it exists, it is there. Don't you feel we have come to know its better on left is it? So what's there? See that. Do you see that light?

Seeker: Says something which is unclear. It's certainly lighter than that.

Shri Mataji: (Laughing) Little imbalance in you it is also sure and you put your left towards me and right hand outside, so you see it's like an I was telling you its like tremense see left hand towards me, and right hand outside, so the flow goes like this to left and it passes out of the right into the elements.

Seeker: Asks question which is unclear

Shri Mataji: No no no, just put this one like this.

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: See and open. You can feel here. If you see, you can feel it. Can you see it? Be careful. Can you? For realized souls, it's not that magnified. Put your both hands on the floor, putting your hands it is worked out. I feel you have started feeling, see it's here. Right hand?

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: What you call vibration is this position you see, for that kundalini, is coming and hitting it hard because there is that position also.

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: Here you see here the problem in the left-hand side is peculiar or something like that.

Seeker: Shri Mataji right side?

Shri Mataji: Right side is the liver, right side is the liver.

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: But actually you see heat may not be in the organ itself but it may be in the center. Now the swadishthana chakra is responsible for thinking, planning. Things start from there, it gives all the ideas to the brain, it transforms the fat of the stomach into the cells of the brain. This is nowhere in the medicine you will find this, but you see from where do these cells come in, you know we are using it every time. So from where does, it come? It comes from the stomach. The transformation is done by the swadishthana chakra. So when you plan and think and all that, that is the one which supplies.

Seeker: Swadishthana means... which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: Aortic plexus this yellow one, you can see it in the hands.The one which goes around the void. It is has got a stem, it can move around like this in the radius or it can even become small like this, sometimes here there so it looks after that part, and it is responsible for transforming fat cells of the stomach into the grey cells in the brain. So when you think too much or work too much or plan too much is through Swadishthana chakra or creativity also and a creative person if there is an artist you see you will find his swadishthana will be spoilt. Because he is using the powers too much of the creativity, and there is no way of replacement of that power. For example, you are going by car and petrol has been used, so you develop also tension that petrol is used up, and there is no way of filling it up. But supposing by some method you become one with that power, then there is no ignition trouble, it is flowing all the time, it's something like that. Now there is a deity sitting on that on the swadishthana chakra and this deity has once, has incarnated on this earth, once and he came as Hazrat Ali, he is the deity. Now, these Muslims do not know, they are fighting like fools against Hazrat Ali. Now, you take Hazrat Ali's name immediately swadishthana chakra will be started, its vibrations flowing and even just talking about him, and the deity's name is Brahmadeva, he is the one which is the creative side or creator side of God, aspect of God. Can you imagine Hazrat Ali was such a great deity here now as the Nabhi this on the neighborhood which has moved to the navel now, at the navel side you can see that see clearly through the Nabhi, you see now can you see it makes the movement like this, It's very little flow, in some people I will show you when the people will come for realization then I will show you. Now this one is the Nabhi Chakra. At Nabhi Chakra what is the thing is the deity known as the Laxmi Narayana or we call them as Vishnu and Laxmi. Now these deities are the sustainers, are the ones which creates sustaining power within us, which gives us dharma the religion of everything like as I told you about the gold has its own religion that it is untarnishable. Human beings have their religion, animals also like scorpion is a scorpion, lion is a lion, they have a dharma. Dharma doesn't mean religion doesn't mean outside going to churches and all. It doesn't mean that it means a human being has a sustaining power. For example, the ten commandments are here. Ten dharmas in the Nabhi, in the solar plexus now, this is there now in him it is disturbed a little bit and this sustaining power of Vishnu is disturbed. Now if you take his name it will move. Another thing is surrounding it, surrounding this deity, the sustaining deity of Vishnu and Laxmi is the void as you see there. This void is always looked after by another deity as the primordial master and he was the same as we had Abraham, Moses, he is the same as we had Mohammed Sahab, and he is the same as Guru Nanak, they are all the same people came back again and again and preach the same thing in a different atmosphere. They are the same people (Laughing), tracking our neck and they are the primordial masters, they are the Adigurus, and he has that problem. why? Because still, he has not accepted me as a guru, that's why you are having this. (Name of the seeker is unclear) He accepts me as a Mother but not as a guru so far. Now, Alright. You know the reason. (Laughing). Good now. Close your eyes, see the dilatation of the pupil, you can see this. Yours are also dilated. Look how black is it looking you see his eyes (Laughing). (Bell rang at the door) Open the door. So in the Monday lecture, I am going to give you all the details, I will also tell you the medical terminology, it's not much but a little bit, how gross they are acting on the different plexuses of things like that, but I don't think I will be going into the details of it and what are these powers and what are these deities how they have incarnated but on the third day when we are going to have a Monday again then I think I will talk on tantric. The way people have exploited it, and the way its all wrong that I will tell the third day. And for the fourth day, I think.

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: I am only here for a month do you know that? You didn't realize that.

Seeker: Says something which is unclear

Shri Mataji: Yeah, but I will come back and we will have a program again. This time I am going to America, just telling them how to begin with. It's absolutely complete you see the knowledge is complete, absolutely integrated, and absolutely comprehensive and because this has not happened it was no use talking about it, its something like that it has to happen to you. What's the use of somebody telling you the vibrations you get this you get that. Come along, now he had a very bad childhood, I could make it out, you see, three chakras on the heart see that right side. Please take out your black, as far as possible don't use black too much, you know these days, the horrible things settle down onto the black.

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: You can feel it, how hot this black is.

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: This is the chakra, (Name is unclear), put your hands towards me and bow. Now come along, you all also come along and see the vibrations. Now tell me where do you get the burning? Just sit down and tell me. Now here see here, there only you can feel it, just put attention to him and you will know. You tell me where is it? Which chakra is spoilt? Here feel that. You will be getting tingling or burning on the finger here.

Seeker: This one.

Shri Mataji: This one, what else, now tell me. Where do you feel now?

Seeker: Mother I just felt it here. The rest is unclear.

Shri Mataji: That is equilibrium. (The door opens, someone comes in) Hello, Hello! Come along. Hello! Seeker: It's been late, I am sorry.

Shri Mataji: Even I had come late today, sit down. So now just tell me where is it? His this center is not settling down, it's going here and there but its actually here if you see and a little bit here, it's not settling down, it's coming up here. You have had psychological problems, quite a lot, see like here.

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: Yes, very true. You see these are all sympathetic indications of the sympathetic nervous system you see of all the seven chakras as I told you, all these five and this is the sixth and this center is the seventh. These are the seven centers actually you can see and you can feel it yourself when you become a little more sensitive you feel it much better. Now the problem with him is you see he has a psychological problem here in the brain, he has got it here. So it gets distributed you see, it starts from his heart, because he has had a very bad childhood, father was a bhoot side, I mean father is a drinker side, father side is the right-hand side in the heart and left-hand side here. He has had a very bad childhood. So this is all here, and this is all been sucked your security, your parents are important because they bring a pure sense of security. His sense of security was very poor, now here this side see the center here in the chakra resides Mother of the Universe or you can call her as Jagadamba Goddess, she resides here. On the right-hand side is the deity which is the aspect of existence of God Shiva, and on this side is the Rama, Shri Ram is on this side, he is the father. I am sorry he is the father and the left-hand side is the Shiva, this center is the Jagadama. Now I have taken their names and immediately you find relief has started. Now this is a mantra which you should understand, now what's the use of saying something. Something is wrong say it here at Rama's place, you are taking the name of Krishna, what's the use? Its a big science and it changes from one to another. Now from he's here it may come up here the problem immediately just now make out. At that time if you are saying only this mantra what's the use if the Kundalini has to move forward. You must know at what gate who is standing, whose name is to be taken and where are you now. You are changing gates every moment, moment here moment this side just now he's relaxing here. he's relaxing here, it's going up there, so this is a very great science and its a living science. Mantra is not a dead science so when they tell you something like that, you must know that it is a dead thing that they are calling. As I said you take the name of Rama and some servant must be coming from somewhere, he's not your servant to attend to you. You have to be realized, you have to enter into the kingdom of God, to be a citizen of there so that he attends to you. Otherwise, why should he attend? Everybody you see as the wave in your eye, every time you sit down let's pray and started. No connection nothing no authority just started like that.

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: Who is coming now?

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: Left Agnya is the one which deals with your psyche means the superego if it is from the superego means some sort of possession then Left Agnya that is at the back here but if it is ego then on the right-hand side. But these days you will be surprised that even your ego can be possessed, it also possesses. The ego has gone to such a limit now that it possesses you, sort of it accepts the possession from out you see, so difficult this thing. But on the fingers, you can know whether it is right or left. Now you see if you put this into some living thing, it can catch that possession, something living it catches that possession that's why you see when Christ put them into the pit, He was hanged. You can't put them into the pits, but I have started some new vegetarian style thing, why to ditch in the pits, we can get some fruits or something just pick it up. Have you got a nimbu? The shop from here, you can get it there.

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: Not that fruits, not fruits you see its lime, that has the best coefficience to catch these.

Seeker: Lemon.

Shri Mataji: Lemon, lemon they are the best thing, they have a special liking also, so they go into the lemon. You take it in the lemon, and put the lemon in the water, they disappear. I have cured so many mad people with this lemon.

Seeker: Says something which is unclear (Laughing).

Shri Mataji: (Laughing) Its satan's play, its a child's play, if you know the job, you see if you know it, its a child's play.

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: What they have written?

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: Yeah

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: The receptor is the word they called for the deities, you see deities are there its very easy to understand but you know we do not think about deities, we just say alright, alright, like that. For example, they will say as in human being and ascetical meaning you see, in the future in the parasympathetic and sympathetic. Now they say, the doctors themselves have come and confessed this, that they react in the human beings in a very different fashion. One will augment, one will relax, in one center it will augment in another it will relax, he knows that and what the doctors say that the more the fraction of these chemicals why they are so merit in a human body we cannot explain, finished. Because there are deities they think. For example, now, anything foreign goes into the body has to be thrown out is a nature that's how it goes, but when it is a fetus, a baby, then not only that it is kept there but is nurtured, looked after, how it is decided, who decides there in the womb that it is a baby and not to be thrown out, they accept it, they receive it, to be nurtured. We just can through science you can say that this is black and this is white, but we can't say how it is black and from where it has come. Science can only do that much whatever you see you can see, but this you cannot see the all-pervading power, unless and until you are realized, you cannot know. But after getting realization you will be amazed you can even see Kundalinis moving above, you can even see those dead souls moving about, now this anybody can see, you see there's a sunflower because only the sun's light it considers but the sun is the thing which didn't choose the sunflower. See now, you always feel very much lighter than you had when you have first come. ( Laughing).

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: It clears your heart, you see. For you have found the truth they disappear from you.

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: Both you see, you can be possessed from both the sides, now this is man is a transcendental fellow he does it from the right side, he has another horrible guru, he puts them in the right side. See actually the people here don't know any Sanskrit, so you speak what's bij mantra, you will say Ahaa Ahaa he has given us bij mantra. I mean in India, every dog can do that, there's nothing special about it. But they have taken full advantage of this. Tell me now, what? You are not going to stick on now. But what I am saying is that they have harmed your kundalini very much, that's the main part is. They have harmed your inner being too much, and that's the main thing. This is the first time they have done it, they have never done it that way before, you see. They have never entered into this area. But because of your impatience, the way you full headed had a plunge into it, you see (Laughing). You got this hurt. If you have waited a little bit, it could have worked out alright. Left Nabhi.

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: Can you feel the heat from his body? So much heat is coming now. Not at the time, you have already been realized about the guru, otherwise, he would have beaten you because they entice you, they entice you, you are absolutely lost into that. You don't see anything else, it's very difficult till you reach a certain point of your realization and you realize that whats wrong with you. When there is no goodness at all, how can you do, all the darkness is there.

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: The first thing, he does is to make you a vegetarian.

Seeker: Yeah.

Shri Mataji: You see this is the best way of eating people. This day before yesterday I met a Finland girl, one ambassador's wife, she was terrible but her daughter went to somebody like that, and he said you should become a vegetarian and this girl became so addicted, that they said she might develop TB. See her. Is she better ?. What's wrong? What have you done in your life?

Seeker: I am a painter.

Shri Mataji: I tell you sawdishthana chakra, she is catching and swadishthana is she uses for her. She's an artist.

Seeker: Say something which is unclear (Laughing).

Shri Mataji: What he said?

Seeker: Says something which is unclear (Laughing)

Shri Mataji: It works.

Seeker: Says something which is unclear. It's not cold yet.

Shri Mataji: Take Hazrat Ali's name. Are you better now? and you? Are you? you? Do you say harsh things sometimes? (Name is unclear)

Seeker: Sometimes.

Shri Mataji: I know. Your father was harsh to you?

Seeker: Yeah

Shri Mataji: What was the mantra?

Seeker: Shri Rama's.

Shri Mataji: Shri Ram

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Seekers talking with each other which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: Where is your father?

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: What was your first father's name?

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: (Name unclear). Now close your eyes, now tell your father please take your birth.

Seeker: Please take my birth.

Shri Mataji: Your birth, his own birth, he should take his own birth, means he should be born again and that I will give him realization also. Eyes close, you tell that I am perfectly alright now, don't you worry about me, say that, close your eyes. Feeling better now?

Seeker: Says something which is unclear. (Crying)

Shri Mataji: Now you will have to know how to take the love so much. Alright?

Seeker: Yeah

Shri Mataji: You are going to be completely engulfed into it and then you have to give love to others, that's what it is. Just simple play. Take it and give it. Nothing else is there. Just keep to yourself, all the personalities, just fill it up inside and you will progress. Nothing much is to be done.

Seeker: I like it. I would like to do that.

Shri Mataji: See how many brothers and sisters you are here, and so many reside in India, and so many in America, all over the world you have so many brothers and sisters and they talk the same language as you do, they are the same people.

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: What is it?

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: Watch my face here, you watch here, all of you should watch because you see your Agnyas are unstable. How are you? Better? Good now.

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: You are good now. Better?

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: It's coming in the up?

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: Now, how are you feeling? Better? Relaxed? His heart chakra is weak. You know actually your parents after the war, became very nervous people, I don't blame them also. You see the whole thing took upon their nerves very much and they reacted differently. Some became very solemnized, some became very worried about the habitat, some became very aggressive, all sorts of things you see how it affects they became very fanatics all sorts of things happening. So they lost that grip over their children the way they should have been, that now lets fix-up. They should have built up their children with affection and that's how the children felt this insecurity very much. On top of that, you felt that they were very mediocre people and have to seek their love in materialistic. So you gave them up and started searching, and when you started searching you see you lost the route of your securities also because you see without parents having you to get out, you know every minute you have to fight for your life, and that became too much because after all, you are a human being. Even an animal needs its parents, so what about human beings? And the whole thing toppled out in this, that's why lots of problems, the way they brought you up, that's why you people became so insecure, so nervous and all the values of life are completely disturbed.

Shri Mataji: Better now, you are better now.

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: From England?

Seeker: No Germany

Shri Mataji: From Germany? East or west?

Seeker: No, west.

Shri Mataji: We have been to the East very recently.

Seeker: Do they allow you to come there?

Shri Mataji: No, because of my husband's job, we went down. Very bad still I would say they are not free people yet.

Seeker: It's better (Laughing)

Shri Mataji: Started feeling vibrations?

Seeker: Yeah

Shri Mataji: Very much better. How are you feeling now? How are you? Still there? But now you are separated from yourself because you can see yourself this is happening, it is coming here, this is catching and you don't feel bad about yourself, you see.

Seeker: Says something is unclear (Laughing)

Shri Mataji: (Laughing) It was changing places is it?

Seeker: Yeah. Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: Where do you live in?

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: He has brought in your house?

Seeker: No no. Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: You give him a Bandhan like this, I will teach you how to give, that will be alright, your place also can be done right, if you see there's something it will be alright.This is also homosexualism, this is all non-sense you know. I mean these people tunk once and I mean its all absurd things going on they are trying to you know, completely brainless. Now there's a big sale going on Crocks or the punks. I feel by purchasing those clothes what are you going to gain. (Laughing) So superficial it is you see. It is made in the factory, sold by these people and I think some of these things are done by also business people just to sort of create a new craze because the machine is all the time you see, vomiting lot of material and it is to be put on someone somehow so they create punks of their deteriorated junk, I don't know what they are creating (Laughing) at such a big rate they are exhausting the mother earth, nothing at all, there's no need, you see, to do all that. What's the need to do all that?

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: Dream Factory? What is a dream? It's a very very bad dream, imagine people will come.

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: Better now? His kundalini passed from the Right Agnya. With your fingers the kundalini rises, you can feel it yourself when it's rising. With your fingers you can rise it, you can tie it up. How are you now?

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: Now see, better? Started, see? And you don't feel bored with this, born together, you never feel bored at all, no more boredom, nice now, you are alright, give her a bandhan. You are still in the Nabhi, you see the Nabhi Chakra because of your Right Heart, you just take out (Name unclear). His kundalini has risen up to a point, but the complete force has not come, because in the Nabhi you can see it still pulsating, you can see pulsation. You can feel it?

Seeker: Yeah I mean I can feel my Nabhi. Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: Now you put your left hand on the Nabhi and right hand towards me, left hand on the Nabhi and right hand towards me.

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: I heard about it very bad vibrations of what call is the runners, he used to run for miles and he did hath yoga, hath yoga I beg your pardon.

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: Sufi, so he did Sufi. (Laughing)

Seeker: Says something which is unclear. (Laughing)

Shri Mataji: Really? It's all washed out now, doesn't matter, don't you worry. You just have to have more patience in you. So another thing is you should have is patience.

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: You must be blackmailing sisters (Laughing)

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: Terrible they are, still they are on this psychology set, they have a set psychology, we had one lady from there she was so bad that she became a real problem in India, they said Mataji from where did you get this crack please send her to there,(Laughing), very bad, she knew that what was here name (Name unclear)?

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: Mary (Laughing).

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: She was a nice lady, but her husband was murdered by then, so it happened, she got completely lost.

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: Better now?

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: You have got throat trouble also?

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: Throat?

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: Then you may have throat trouble if you don't have now then you may have.

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: No no it just indicates, you are an instrument you see, if it is not yours then it is his.

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: Better?

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: Are you married?

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: Give it a bandhan, very bad because I asked you," Are you married?"

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: Better now?

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: She didn't clear it out? I felt very bad.

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: Simultaneously, you see it working, you become one body and one feeling, you see its universal. Even if they are actually born realized, they will say the same, even if you close their eyes they will say the same. My four grandchildren are realized souls all of them, my daughters are not realized souls and the youngest one is a little girl she was hardly six months and she used to raise the kundalini. She was one years of age then she used to come and see me, and she would bring something that I use to wear or something that I put on. Early in the morning, my two other granddaughters, they were hardly five or six months old, get up in the morning first come and just start looking at my face, absolutely desperate all the time, for half n hour they would be there looking at my face and anybody got hurt or anyone they use to just come on my feet, that time, anything happened they will first come, it's like that they are so much and they know about kundalini already. Like this (Name unclear) hes so young he knows everything about it, he's born like that.

Seeker: Interesting.

Shri Mataji: So many children are born like (Name unclear). So many realized children are born these days, so many of them and they are very religious, they observe each and everything. Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: Yeah they were born realized, yes yes, that's true they were realized in last lives, that's how they are here. This (Name unclear) recognized me, I mean in no time.

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: His mother was asking he said to her," What happened?", "What do you think of yourself?

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: He's saying they are all coming in Sahaja here.

Seeker: Says something which is unclear. Shri Mataji: What's he saying?

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: Take the name of (Name unclear) (Laughing), they are Avadhutas. They also work relentlessly I have seen, they work relentlessly and they understand religion so clearly, so clearly. This younger one of younger daughter of mine, we went to a place she was listening to people playing instruments and taking the name of God, she said I must tell you something about the people of this place, they are very foolish. I said "Why?" She explains, you see they are all the time troubling God, taking the name of God, morning till evening they are saying "Hare Rama Hare Rama Hare Rama Hare Rama" now God has gone away from their long time back, now I am also going to run away from here, it's too much. Why don't they understand (Laughing) I told you about what she said about Lama also, she said why are you sitting like this, by sitting like this you will become God.

Seeker: Oh Yeah Yeah in other lecture.

Shri Mataji: and my daughter didn't know what to do, she said why don't you say it like that, otherwise she's a very humble child, he's a simple person why are you touching his feet, he's not a realized soul. All of them they were possessed, so she went and brought the broom from there, she was showing the broom to that person, so then they will run away. You know broom is a very good way, in a realized soul's house if there is a broom, it has those vibrations, so with those in the broom, these demons run away. So she was showing there that broom so that if the devil is anywhere he will run away. (Laughing) That's such admirable.

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: I didn't see it all but Aradhana told me, she said Nani you going to get lot of dry in India, so you get rid of it with oil, I said, "How?" She said," very easy take some oil, vibrate it and put it in the sea, so it will get oil and really they did it and they did it. After that they found it dissolves.

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: You better? Feeling alright now?

Seeker: Says something is unclear.

Shri Mataji: Mataji's children are more than sufficient, that's most important is upbringing children the right way, the human being is the most important of all the living beings. Nothing is important, only the human beings who are free, who are righteous and who are seeking God is the highest of all and they are to be respected and they are to be worshipped, rest of it is can't make out anything. How is it? Are you alright?

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: You have, (Laughing), still have.

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Seekers discussing among themselves which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: You are feeling sleepy right now? Is it?

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: Where?

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: Where inside?

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: Here?

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: Better? Better now?

Seeker: Hmmm

Shri Mataji: Now, from where did you get the pain?From your Agnya?

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: Did you hear that?

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: Now see yourself, now improved? Feeling better?

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: You deserve much more. Alright? I had to come again and again.

Seeker: Thank you very much.

Shri Mataji: And just respect yourself that's the main point, love yourself. I will be here tomorrow, tomorrow, and Sunday I will be definitely here, tomorrow also.

Seeker: Shri Mataji tomorrow you might be here or (Says something which is unclear)?

Shri Mataji: I will be here.

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: What?

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: Alright. May God bless him. Put your right hand on your heart. When did you go to that side? What did you do?

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: You can become nirvikalp in no time, you have already got some Sahaja yogis that are in Nirvikalp, you see nirvichar is thoughtless awareness that you have got already. You get that thoughtless awareness now you want to see what you love to do you can see, after some time you become nirvikalp whenever you want when you get nirvikalp means there is no vikalp, which is no doubt, doubtless awareness.

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: Then you jump into doubtless awareness, that's very easy it's nothing when you steady yourself you become doubtlessly aware. These big names you see they just try to impress you.

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: What?

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: Not at all.

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: No I think it is ofcourse all these are negativities that attack, as they say, all those things are on the left-hand side all these bhootish things and then all the spirits, which have been.

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: It has meaning, you see this is the center heart chakra, this is the thing, you know when you work with spirits they do not link, they hurt you there, and you see one of the Sahaja yogis in India had such a black thing. He had such a black entering here.

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: It was so black and all these things are on this left-hand side, all these spirits, you shouldn't bother them, in no time, they all run away, you all live in the conscious mind at the present here at this point, you are not supposed to bother about these dead, let them be.

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: That's why you see, that's why I feel so bad, that's why I feel so horrid, you think of a mother who knows that to all her children she has to give realization and in between somebody has come and put a clause, how she will give and has ruined them. You see it's like a tiger coming from somewhere and attacking on my own tree and destroying it, something like that. Despite your seeking only you are done, that makes me feel even worse. It's not a mistake of yours, I wouldn't say. It is bad to ruin you like that. I hope some of you recover. It's very bad.

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: Yeah alright, let them be. (Laughing). You see in this prosecution they are prospering that. They are doing that, you are not.

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: In terms of money?

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: See you can see that one, you can put that one. You start feeling your hands become black.

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: (Laughing) That's the truth is that so much of black is inside his body you see. What? With my attention, I wish I can work you know (Laughing), working on it because I have been holding in my hand.

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: This is good for you.

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: Feeling in the head. Now how can you feel this bliss after all this damage, and it still lies there, that's the point I was saying that you must work on it, and at once you must get rid of it. So, how are you?

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: This is meditation, this is progressing, this is your power manifesting, when you will start curing others and when you will start giving them things when you will start giving them tranquility, and you will start raising their kundalini, then you will know that you have your own powers, otherwise how will you know, you have to work it out.Better? How are you?

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: Let them come

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: No, no, you are in meditation only. You are rather thoughtless.

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: You see on my photograph you can do.

Seeker: Says something which is unclear. I tried it yesterday. But it is like printed? Is that alright if it is printed?

Shri Mataji: Alright, that photograph is very powerful. You are very fortunate that the photograph has such vibrations. It's a very great thing, so you can distribute photographs. You can keep it in a proper place because there are deities sitting around and some of them are always there.

Seeker: Yeah I know

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: What?

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: You can try.

Seekers discussing something among themselves which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: It will go away with sugar, you see gradually it will go away. (Name unclear) has tried all kinds of tricks, and it didn't go away. Now you see some of the things stick around they go away and come along, but you don't worry about them, it will go away.

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: Don't feel like that. Better now?

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: Better?

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: Your father lives in France?

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: Watch it.

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: Better? See because of him, he's doing something on and on, so its a very big attack coming and to remove it you have work it out that fast, but if you could just forget him for some time then it will work out in no time.

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: Most of you are born saints, born saints and that's why you are attacked always. Saints are always attacked, that's why you are attacked and the attack will come directly through these sadhus and gurus who are talking of God and religion only, you see. So I don't blame you for that, such is the trick they use. They use all the methods that Gods are using, prayer, bhajan, everything they started, everything, hymns, prayers, everything they started but behind that is satanic, now and forever. For example, I saw one dirty magazine, that was filled with all satanic forces, so I told Gavin we are going to use that magazine, so I put it there and it worked.

Seeker: Says something which is unclear. Shri Mataji: It didn't come up from, such small words they have written nobody could have read it, they wrote it like that.

Seeker: Says something which is unclear.

Shri Mataji: Photograph? The photograph was also not very clear.
