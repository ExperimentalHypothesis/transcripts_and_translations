The Importance of Sahaja Yogis

It was such a fortunate thing that I could come for this Easter puja here to see you all meet you and see the growth of Sahaja Yoga within you. I can see in your faces. I can see in your eyes the light which is so benevolent and so balming. When I came to this place long time back and looked at it everyone told me that this should not be bought, at all, at any cost. I did a very long puja especially to my husband who said I may not touch it with a barge pole. ...................... but I got my way and I knew the potential of this place. Then the second time when I came to this place where you are standing was even worse than what I had seen.(laughter)............................I.talked to people quite surprised...............and when I said something very strongly the thing started changing. I first felt that I was rather strong but I think it helped started changing and changing and now you see a beautiful hall here, beautiful place for relaxing. So same thing with Sahaja Yogis are here you have the potential no doubt otherwise you wouldn’t have come to Sahajio. You see I was reading the predictions that were made about 16000 years back about Sahaja Yoga and so much clearly indicates exactly what is going to happen. Firstly it says that in the beginning in one carew sahaja yogis 100,000............................among 10 million people there will be one person which is. So each one of you represents 10 million people of this World, just imagine. See your importance, how important you are? And then it is said that Sahaja Yoga will be established in 1970 very clearly he said it, it will be started in 1970 so clearly it says and then my work will take place after ........Sahaja Yoga will grow into a very deep and be corrective...................... but what was said about you is the most remarkable...............................................................this is matter the Sahaja Yogis will have the capacity to become so subtle that their subtlety can enter into any being of that you already do by your vibrations but not only that but you can travel anywhere you want to. You can find out about the whole Universe. You don’t need airplanes you don’t need satellites you are so subtle and the other day I was looking at some of the photographs which are given for development here which are very remarkable. In the photographs all the Sahaj Yogis there are sitting .................and on top of their heads you can see the light individually on every person and the light is surprisingly is so primary is like ...............graph through the cardiograph you see the way the cardiograph shows like a heartbeat but it is very surprising. All of you have got it on your head. Of course there are some other very miraculous photographs that have come out where I am sitting like this and all the Gods and Goddesses are sitting on the sides and pouring vibrations. Not only that but there are ....................flowers that are getting my vibrations.....................................that are really so wonderful as if there is a big fireball going on, tremendous all that and it was done by a very ordinary medical student who had very small little camera so small that he had thought..............................to be taken to some other studio. So all these things are coming up and showing you what you could be or what you have to be and what will become of you. Its not only Indian Sahaj Yogis but all of you mostly you are Western there sitting in front who have got this on top of your head......................................so much much more than we can think of. When I look at this house it is unbelievable you see. Anyone who sees this cannot believe that we can make this into such a beautiful thing with very little money we didn’t have so much money to do it, so meticulously, so lovingly you have done it and it has turned out to be so beautiful. I wish you could see the different photographs of this place but your own faces should be seen different time with Sahaja Yoga. How it has grown so fast, it is very very very fast indeed and to transform human beings is sometimes difficult but even to transform them is like in Sahaja Yoga you have transformed leaves into flowers roots into flowers. All kinds of things are seen and surprised how potential you were there’s nothing special about me. (Laughter) It’s true. I must say ......................................because you see I am what I am. I am............................an achievement but for you you have such potential. Unexpectedly see all this has happened everywhere and now you are surprised to see in India there are sixteen centres in one city. Now this building they are expanding but you can expand, your collectivity can expand and that is what you have to do for that; all you have to do is to really work hard to expand it. First of all you yourself will be a witness to................the seed............................................................................................................................nothing special is needed to grow into that, everyone can blossom into something very beautiful. You don’t have to be sort of outwardly from the working point of view. From the wordly point of view you could be very ordinary people but your potential is so much that you can rise to the highest and this is how I see from this house that you can become very beautiful from and that beauty people will see; definitately they will be impressed such beautiful people they are and with their beauty so meditative. That’s how it has to happen. You see we can very clearly see how the media and the rest of the World is towards Sahaja Yoga. They cannot understand it they haven’t got those divine eyes and those divine days to see what you have achieved. What you have got and things. What they have got is nothing but just a retiring force for ingrowth especially the media it’s not going to help you much, the reason is ...........................they want disasters.

We wont have any disasters you have seen that. You will have no disasters.............................................journey slowly and steadily. Everybody is moving within this. You have to help yourself a little bit no doubt but I think on the whole I myself am surprised like the little flowers are growing by the tree itself. The tree itself is looking after the flowers .................................. has no time only the ...................................is thinking about the flowers all the time. It works so beautifully. Nice to see you all here, very nice. May God bless you all.

I wanted to tell you about certain programmes we have ...............................

On the 5th May this time
it will be 6th May in Rome we will be having the Sahasrara
puja and no doubt I would say that you should all try and come for
this Sahasrara day. We have decided that we can have some marriages
if you want,and those who want to get married or even re-married

................................................These marriages outside India are going to be a difficult task getting things. We have to smuggle lots of things in (laughter) and will not be easy so we would like to know at least in time how many want to get married. Now the expenses ..........................work it out. I don’t think it will be much more than what we have in India but if you want to have saris say for example or if you want to have all these ornaments and everything then I have to think of smuggling them and now we have some people already working in my house there so we can work it out but we should know in time otherwise it will be very difficult so within say fifteen days , when you go back please find out immediately inform ............ in England............................................and let me know the final list of people who are getting married as I would like to do the same way as we have done in India but to do it is most difficult in these countries ..........................................cant get everything that you can get in India, not so easy, some things we have to bring from India if you want to have that kind of a wedding or we can have a church wedding if you like (laughter) no actually for real.............................................................................or you can have a muslim wedding if you like (laughter).............................................................Cerrtificates of Marriage from Australia, lots of preparations are needed and there is no other way out. I don’t think we have any such place that we could organise, isn’t it because the pujas are going to be in different places ....................France we have Guru puja but for Guru puja you don’t have marriage so whatever is your idea........................................When are you going to have Ganesha puja?

Yogi: Milano

JSM Milano, what will be the date?

Yogi: August 6th

JSM So would you like to go to Milano in August?(Applause).It is easy to organise in August you see because but still months time you have to let us know within this one months time, May, June, July, August because the things that have to come from India have to come. You see this time the boys had arrived and still one marriage was not settled so then it was the fellow started wearing a which he couldn’t wear properly and the garlanding had already started. Here it is very difficult. We have to organise everything nicely. i am in India it will be much easier. To get things. How many are there for marriages, let us see. How many marriages here in Milan? So its alright then whatever it is you have to decide within the next fifteen days and also when you go back all the leaders to their own places they should find out those who want to get married in August but should be in time. You see that’s what it is in the West you have to organise everything beforehand otherwise nothing can work out at least if you have to have a proper wedding and also you have to inform as to how many saris you would like from India.because that also has to be smuggled in.............................................................

I don’t know what programmes we have.........................................................whatever is the programmes you have decided but also I would like to meet some of you, especially the leaders if possible, now, if possible. Later on................................. May God bless you.

Whatever is the programme you decide.....................................

I forgot to say sorry I got here late.

...............................................................................I’ve got some plants that were given to me for my birthday and I think it would be a good idea to plant them here so that they grow up properly.
