Now you've got a coupon in Brighton also I was amazed how did you manage that Brighton show These are the Couture Easter sent you from India this ones I Bought them here But they had given them some plates item yeah Hello How are you Jenna Sit up Now get me some water What is this I'm not going to lecture not Come just to consult about this Journalism I Think granny should come here and Let's see.

What is the agenda? How are we going to work it out? Now which I say now, how are we going to work now to help what should we do? First my solutions have you there you give me your solution about opportunity difference? That we should have a formal body formal People who will deal with the journalistic side Call it by a name They are calling in America have given they were named Golden Age international So you have a formal body then you must have for that a proper Card system And a kind of appeal or something letter of introduction It's a very crew starts work very such a work of Shri, Krishna Nothing we have to have very clever people in this Other mysterious Too much honesty so-called Which is all dishonest world Will not take us to higher goals So to go to higher goals, you have to sacrifice it you know who it's like to see That we should have only the name of sahaja yoga and we should come out of sahaja Yogi's We may land up in jail if you start that So come at something else You know have a form well with a proper Message that we are here to contact all the people who have alternatives To create the Golden Age On one side We will have a We will have a Face by which people will think you are all neutral people And you can have approved to them directly And on the other side was I That will do you looking very pale must not look fucking very hard If it is you now you better give us some rest now Now after having that phone And one side you will have a face by week. You can meet people you can reach them easily You cannot you will have your own cards send them the cards you are International Golden Age people responsible Wear a formal dress don't go like hippies Because we have tried straightforwardly that's it I will have to save the world. That's our job. That's the real hardwood you have to achieve By hook or crook you have to serve them whether they'll be all finished You can't take them out out of the water By pulling with your hand put a hoop around them and bring them out Useless blind nonsensical people. They don't want to see the fun what to do All right So one side will have a face another side. You will be always in touch of others who are trying to form the alternative Other gurus either false people other So very cleverly bring them down to surgery It's a fifth columnist You have to enter into them and tell them ultimately this is no good Exposing all of them One by one Because you will be a body a form of a body that Nobody cannot ask for your bona fide e When you enter into these alternatives you can just see the point and say this is this We did that branded that in our street even they brought in sahaja yoga into some Problem a little bit and then it was they asked for forgiveness and the whole joke for nowt and the people didn't understand That's how brought sahaja yoga to a Greek level.

Is it a black? To the big drama they played And Actually Terrence wrote against them that these people came to sahaja yoga this thing and how are they blaming us? Personally that and then it was the base EC drama and then it was said later on that. No, nothing like Sergio you say Something like that. You have to play No, simple methods are going to work with his cunning people extremely cunning Journalists here are very cunning people to Millican So now when you are away immediately become formal you can Find out all the newspapers all the ready terms and go to see them must have black suits yards With white lines And with with oil in the head He's a pure English that cement I Mean little mix blood may be. All right, but not too much but don't take a person who is from Scotland to an English editor, so there are basic by Differences the bias is there So better takers got more squat one to Cottle Write and speak with a little accent We have stupid people All this is done imagine on we should be can you patent this is the job off we should be so many style cities It's not only that you have to speak about it that it has to go all over who these medias are nothing But you should be because I have to be witness and they have to manifest it in Enlargement, they are supposed to be they are placed there for this region so if they don't do it better you the other side of it Before them and use them Because they are there only for this purpose why God has created them and put them in this position just think of it How did they get these medias why God has given them just think of it They are doing all kinds of nonsensical things they are wasting everybody's energy Into all useless enterprises they don't want to do God's work. So you better be fooled up and make them That's what they deserve why God has given them all these powers They haven't achieved anything of their own and they state even a leaf even that they cannot create on their own can they Nothing can be created by man on his own tani just to use something from nature so On one side we have it now there was one polygon he is a failure he is a capillary So he joined an organization, which was trying to save people from all other than his fault He tries to send them and he became quite prominent there And then instead of said sending them to Catholic churches. He said And he said let me be your mother like a priest is good idea I don't want to get up from you But then I can catch a real people spending more. That's how we got then our and all that people even them And he makes fun of folk made fun of everyone and he's there laughing aloud is explicitly He's arranging all that Somebody made him and he said that I've been to these and that So he said now I think I'm fed up not go to Catholicism. He said did you try third?

You better try that's the last time you tried it It's a very interesting intelligent man and he comes to my program alright and Somebody asked him that why do you go to her yoga program? He said I have to find out there also may be some people not busy. So I must find him out Tops to see me a very interesting person very interesting is a priest And also the lady chief lady who is doing the job he's made a resurgence and also this Marie is had joined that organisation So there are three surgeries one is then another is the secretary in another is Marty Who are trying to save people to go to the Catholic Church? Imagine they are actually saving people from Catholic Church So this kind of a thing you must fall then you must have a very general appeal and you must also find out how You can approach these people and you should say we have formed such a such organization here and Also in America they are going to form another one So you can see we have branches in America and also in India and branches all over see we can form everywhere Such branch is not difficult in Sidney and he's the head of that branch. Mr. Brian who has come all the way to see us You can even have a formal inauguration by the Prime Minister That remained I must take on hard work She gave us a bite to eat rhubarb ice, can you imagine can there be anything worse than that? Must be some sinister joy So I would suggest that you form a Very cute over it. All of you are sahaja Yogi's I know if nobody will give up the secrets Is there anybody who you want the secret? Please raise your hand So all this has to be worked out very carefully and understanding that we have to do a tremendous work We have to save so many people and they are also half hearted suddenly you find I've lost one child here and a one child So it's a tremendous task and do this task you have to be very cautious careful and all the methods that are employed Only thing you do not do the Sahara I don't kill anybody. That's what you do that will give it to me You need not tell lies But you need not tell everything Everything need not be told to everyone there's not necessary. They do not have right to know everything about us That's all right.

So this kind of a thing we should form now. You all should have degrees those who are there? So put the only remedies and pids there. Oh Geez and everything They are enamored by this movie you can wear a tie pin if you want Find out all the methods to see and I'll go to a special day a dresser Some people can even wear a wig I do I Take out your rings where you have your mother's humble photograph. I Bet you take out also settings and things inside you can wear something but not outside Or if you are wearing by chance to just turn it round. She be careful not to show the photographs Otherwise, they'll be shocked to see It's all camouflage but what to do with these stupid fools here we have tried everything to see Between them we choose. I mean you've done everything that was possible under the sahaja yoga regime But think they don't want to sit. That was the best thing you starting go straight forward march It's over at hua hin come back. I do think You tried with that Archbishop of Canterbury I Saw the bishop off in London The bishop the main bishop off in London Sitting just next to me He never talked of God. Nothing was talking about gold prices this team that thing But He's like the most of the vicar and everything.

That was there wine the most of all 40 may not be getting so much you see in the church and See God you use the biggest cigar and pocketed 2/3 of them Absolutely when he was wearing the scarlet see that's the color suggested already In this the book of Revelation the scarlet scarlet color, see how they are wearing Scott Absolutely frivolous people and they are misguiding all these people so we have to also Change our dresses and get them into the phone we find some people in there Now on these clients you start then you Have a meeting with all these people here get the name of all the newspapers this thing that thing and approach them and Then tell them that we have got first People who have come to us is sahaja yoga company there may be thoughts whatever it is, but this is what We found it in Sydney they did And this is what is the other papers have done it in Guinea bodies think that's it. So why not here? They can't say no peace because you are going to give the business Later on. I don't know what sort Is there any other suggestion What is it Anything you are that No, no Congress should be America make it two inverted nation, but Whatever you claim. You are that you are higher than all these United Nations or anything for to learn Whatever you sell not Bolton at all Is it Whatever I say it never amounts to go sleep except that you with lots of vibrations It doesn't matter whatever you say call your UN body will refine it This is why not The children that we are working like United Nations only you immediately become toxic, you know, we don't know I Don't know that What do they have all you get? Such in so many idiots working at great people Ambassador speak the people that just eat it. They have no brains nothing. I Have seen go to their house. I Don't know how how they develop this kind of philosophy but Already we went to an ambassador spec Well, you started telling me something CP came there was also watching them So he tasked me Indian language. Do you understand anything what he's saying?

I thought something wrong with Etcetera then I said wild laugh engine sometime. You said I I don't know. I hope I'm writing laughing at the right time Well, he was on for half an hour And his laughter was neither crying or laughing sort of an expression, you know, you don't know what he was going to say So then another he get free soft Units after he did they give lectures like idiots. They don't know what they are talking There are big people And when they give lectures are so embarrassed. You don't know where to There's no sense there. So dignity. There's no understanding nothing. I Mean you will find only one or two persons in an organization sensitive the rest are all idiots Top top rank It's possible to understand how they manage to These are the days of idiots I tell you These are the days of Indians If you are an idiot, then you are at a high position that must be because everybody is afraid of intelligent people see, so I don't think no Prime Minister likes no president likes an intelligent back to with it because he might be ousted you see So they want to have media offers, but actually they in that competition they pick up only the idiots And that's how you find all this problem is that you don't know how to talk to them You don't know what to say Within five minutes you will be amazed what? That they are holding such a big position you have to remember all the time. Otherwise, maybe your driver is better than them Perhaps they drink too much.

Well these parties they are affected by drinks, or maybe I mean, some of them are supposed to be big a Educated Cambridge Oxford But no hot water All sorts of people big big positions in I Mean sahaja, Yogi's are also from there. They don't seem so intuitive That's these people aha like from John Hopkins Institute and all that see I told with a bar about somebody whom I met from the same Institute I said is anything how to do they do that can't understand So you said there are lots of leaders there mother Our team this must be the reason that all the Heads of these countries must be frightened of intelligent people so they must be selecting only people who are little idiotic And then they can find them on a wrongful to see and then they can always resolve them with some weaknesses something must be done This must be the reason otherwise, how can you have such a set of idiots all around? So this is how we have to manage and I think If you can really form this organization properly and save these people from the disaster YouTube is there that is Really the work that one has to very carefully Understand All of you should give them some ideas even locally. You see if you go to a smaller place. They'll be so excited That Oh God such a big organization has come to us and that's how you can impress them You can use my car if you like Or we can buy a second-hand what CDs Or we can even buy a second-hand response We can get it on a high We should do all these tricks, you know, I how you should talk and everything you better study some people or they talk how they stop and How long they talk how they behave how they impress you can give some tips after all Not rolls-royce let's have something different one CD, but you shouldn't take that say a Jeep there isn't Something either we have to have sensible car We're not being a small slice is too much for general do something, you know taught you to judge yourself Something in between Otherwise they'll think some false would not have given you as a present He does that So have something in between, which car you think is best which is journalistic I've see now. I don't know my impressions wave it over. I don't have that car very much. It's like a horse with two camels back inside But see whatever that this must become a circus if he knows all these things so you must have what correcting sweetbreads But that's pretty expensive Carabas So don't use cheap cuts what I'm saying don't use if not those ROI that you don't have none of us have even a second and your family don't around but don't use any car that Would look cheap Ishtar say Something good for a journalist to see Association something like that But you should be careful about that Car is important Then your gestures and behaviors you see how smart you pack things and how you get out and also briefcases to see very important And I'm realize that you carry Yep, so let's have a training center for that I'm not so you can get somebody to train you off What did you do? In football No, but you should not sound clear, you know should sound very British I Mean say like that James one can see women around only successful. I Think who can teach us that They would fall gommi well There are study is interesting to study a manners mannerism little bit to study how to impress Ask your brother how he does it God I don't people are distressed in the shadow Canadian people can be addressed by a pillow but not English Lester when they go to it who's mainly stock where 40 degrees is the temperature?

Canary gipsy left cut this up all their three places because many too often But I stupid fresh people here till there are logs which is their game the faster this time so ever But what to do, that's the meteor. That's the one we have to use. What is food media We have to move this big in I Have taken half of their moves by team is China now you tell me what is to be done on a breslav Article about you in Australia was in a a newspaper called Sydney shot which was So let's use that on that matter I'll have to be agreement massage parlor anywhere But then you to you land up into a place like this Where there's not half an inch is a holy night and you want to create a Holy Land out of it Then how what do you do? You have to put your feet in your Mother it makes no difference wherever she goes third man I have given all freedom to do what you like publish me anywhere Aquila Like this girl Not to our know She somebody that about a gentle CP that it was not dignified Compared to mrs. Srivastava dignity. It was not dignified. She's a very dignified and a saline lady, you know, because in the office, I'm extremely unified Not with my children maybe I can Be very simple then So they thought that how could it be and this lady has really taken advantage of her or sort of things? Oh, no rather upset about it. So I said, all right doesn't matter It's all right, whatever way she has seen me she must have written so I was thinking she should do another article again About me Just him and despite that I mean though, I mean she may be clearly I won't say it It was frivolous, but she it was a little flippant Flippant is the word just flippin to see it didn't go into details at all or anything. I said the biggest response just tonight Under what did she do about it? So she may like to do it again in a proper way This is once I know another side is that if you must have seen An article in a magazine, which you were telling me Indian Maxie Which impressed you very much Coal is Did you see that?

You have yet All right to better send him and get it immediately, all right, you know another thing is his position has come All right now with Mr. Cody he wanted to publish a book. He said so Which will cost fifteen to twenty thousand rupees. It's not difficult to that In which he wants to write about the experiences of all the people from my childhood and this and that But my idea was that you sahaja Yogi's should compile together the experiences Say of different same one may experiment people to do it many people should be Say Sydney people should do it the people in England should do it and they should Write about each and every person you see those who have to write So those who have to write something about me should send it to say now from Bom Bom Bay Those who are in Bombay should write to somebody involving Those who are in Delhi should write to somebody in Delhi who will compile it put it together and put it in a proper way some sort of a right to Vomit people to find out somebody who is of journalistic nature and here Also These must be sent to say hevene or someone and the same committee that we have see should deal with this side To find out what you think is preferred. What is to be given and all the fantastic things that we are afraid even after They're saying about the petroleum Write it down everything and all these experiences can be compared and the you can put the name as Miracles off overreach or something like that And then he can put it the way he lies we should say we supply you for the Chilean from him Or then he can edit it And also we can get it published If he wants polish it let him publish it each other way. He was hurt We can get it very nicely done for him But he must publish the book And the book must win English not in the enemies, is that the main point But also we should not use very difficult English uses because it should be internationally understood Not only big sentences complicated and also using idioms From English literature and things that's no another goes into the hex. Now people are not lips just a Lot of the people who write our literature and they use all these idioms from the literature Those who are not used to just do it. How much that you understand? They try to show off you see that I had average this book and I'm Best thing is to put directly not using any Quotations for many literally good you can use it from by building ships if you want But that is not necessary for living experiences but just can see that my hand started speaking to me and you can say Christ have said I just I've never And That book can be done very well and will be sold all over the world We can send him an introduction also very beautiful introduction to the subject So while the sahaja Yogi's should sit down and write all the good things not like this that half uttered and half a Lifetime all right, but still I had With buts and ifs you should not write if you have any buts and ifs in keep each other So the how fake people should not write it them you sir? You have missed a very nice part We could like to see what happened So that you can see that itself. We are forming a new organization Called Golden Age International for journalistic miss you Well, you shouldn't also love no matter what you are teaching them should we marry see this Otherwise will be called as DVD people.

The delivery will respond, you know Just imagine they knew that he used to give Oh In this book you can write about people who had a negative approach like the letter to our to be shivering Like unit each other exposed that's the time we can expose them now The responses introduction first and the responses are then First give the responses of the gurus who are realized souls how they have acted. They have done this and of My show means you can write that first is to say there's nothing like a devil nothing no each Everything is fine. Right as soon as he heard the name of Mataji Nirmala dishes. He said she's the devil Otherwise Devi did not exist Yes, I know we should say I went to this fellow and this happened that happened this book I Mean you can say That we had many people one after another We had series of things you see with us I think I mean has got some of these things that this fellow from Denmark had sent. Have you got Why did cleaned up on that also Attend let us find out so you can mention that Although there were so many indications from people. We could not see Even this fellow said this is the mantras meaning we could not see you see some other than our mind was like that So to prove that there was a kind of a position or a kind of air Curtain on our head that we couldn't see him though. These were pointed out to see nobody bothered because one Gentleman who has floated him long time back from America though. He didn't understand the subtler side of it, but he gave the growth side This was really remarkable that people could get over it how he made money how he had to embezzle money for him and How many? millions and millions of dollars There to take up everything he had given that later with that himself And he also said that if I have mentioned anything wrong let them prosecute But nothing happens And about women how he had relationship with women and all that he did mention I Don't know if those papers are there or not, but it was so cool, huh? The name of the fellow That's running things were like that which whereas he says we are given to Peter to see which have kept them But if you can't find whatever it is that they were warning coming all through you see anybody who is intelligent and see this And convert But nobody listened to it.

I Mean you all thought that you are doing for as a cause of CCD world government imagine He because he made the whole show such a me with the show was such that you had to be Now you having to that? 14 year one is it? Now this one also he's got 15,000 disciples even now even now he speak And he calls himself perfect. Cool One of his disciples came a Tony does know even how to say perfect is a perfect. Perfect guru I am a perfectly was repeating that word again. Anyway, and this fellow the English and you had to translate it and the Queen of Spain complained to the to the ambassador of Spain Indian ambassador of Spain That it's a shameful thing how we can send such a man to our country He has just finished our young generation. The whole race is lost Nobody listens, you know, that's the trouble He's a perfect guru perfect I made them mad you don't delegate selfish So the whole book would be Where are the seaters? Where are they lost what has happened to them? Everything can be covering this in a video with me Tragedies Industry Please leave a review is easy to be a Christian I think that's probably going in the next or next that one is you know, because we sent it It's I also have got some of the words Lunch was translated I all together so that's going in as well. I simply remarkable I am a cosmic confidence true.

It's by one of these Christian sellers There's quite a good there is lots of any size without the way he is brought in with the writer Anytime Anybody who finds anything like that in writing In his state see what you can find out like we can say that they send about three taboos and Theta waves you only get it from Epileptic patient Very carefully without involved in people, who are Dangerous to us but route you can help Gurus are all right, there's no how because you can use. This fellow's name on over but not people like say We can say down Like say some Prime Minister is it war with TM, for example we need not bring his name Because they won't like it and they'll try promise such people so we can around the President Before this was what was he he was a that Baptist Church somebody was from the Baptist Church was president of America was that Doctor Also these churches you see you can point out that I one person can say I've been like you and talk about these What 7:30 or what in resources the Pentecost is no, I'm asking now 20 postures There's a International. Oh, there's an organization called Family Action information and rescue already formed and it's been run by MP called pourers and he comic service employers and his phone is an organization and as you be affected the model they do if they If anyone's been detected and area You can ask them can one ask what do you have to say about visa, but we can interview that And that's very much like the movies in that needs to take teenagers and young people and keep them totally out of contact with the outside world and Keep them cut off from their parents and all this sort of things starvation diets and sugar buzzing all these techniques they used to use So I was told To help the parents who had lost their teenagers with young adult children To get them back to the D program and get the brainwashing out of them And they've got lots of useful information my dad won't see them what you see as an organisation of n1 students is very Skeptical You see but they can be quite confused right in you like this fellow I went to see him John will tell you I told him all against these so-called religions And ultimately told John that we cannot have an interview at length because people don't like to hear about religions and he made it Is he your job All right, right whatever I did to say whatever You say you have an interview with mountain broadcast but in Lawrence Spicer The interviewed mother Solely, because sahaja Yogi's wrote letters to mr Spicer out of interest from his previous interview so we can need to be filled up on what we've already done on this show Interest as sahaja Yogi's with just as people Not only sell Yogi's but you start to put non-sahaja yogis. See they didn't write at sahaja Yogi's all of them So why we should not say sahaja Yogi's wrote we should say there was a big him because he asked him that he should come and Between us in the secret of The 15 minutes interview now You can also write about you are know that or not just we had a lot of for this one. All right you can have All right On the right She got up at 4 a.m. They must have thought that you see surgeries are supposed to get up at 4 a.m Also not spicy recorded an interview between John flower and Western in fact even Christian who please grant this Interview will be broadcast in September and is mainly concerned with our attitude towards Jesus and the Ten Commandments Clip grant was not negative in fact he said in the interview that he thought sahaja of the sounded good because we follow him believe in Christ and by the Commandments but because his vibrations were tricky they seemed best to be diplomatic and not confront his ego the result of his Diplomacy maybe to make sahaja. Yoga sound rather Christian But Kollek Christian eating was given limit. Yeah That's why he did that and the other things we wrote a letter to US my pals who wrote various articles and books One article mastiff Aria. That's the father That's appearing in The Observer We said that we were certain we had found the truth and wanted a professional objective and discerning journalist to investigate our claims Dissatisfied with our authenticity write an article we have yet to hear a reply Now that you won't fuck off with you, but with this organization To write personal letters to people important No doubt well one addition to all important people better write important TV producers How did this nothing Nothing then won't even allow me five minutes there No, but let it be done by this organization, yes But you see that failure can be done by this organization I'm deaf. I'm sure The would watch it let them do it.

You have to wonder but not just now you should not sound that you are hadoo You can take films of other gurus also under the circumstances you can go and see share Hari Rama All right under this Right you ask them questions I Will give you the proper thing to approximate Awesome question first of all, very nicely Then with other Guru God's we should be prepared practice organization. You can meet them take their with you and Give this to these people that These are what we are going to supply You are just talking in a very neutral way to people from Hari Rama Hari And I'll tell you the loopholes and then you ask the questions on them Like TM people, but the people who have On the other We can we choose first of all give him Indian power to make building sahaja yoga to commit then we see how our body would Because then you are neutral You can ask him that this is Roman Catholic has done this and that to see I'll give you everybody through codes So let us prepare some forces on these He was quite Himself he did it in contact with his adviser to Indian Affairs And also a bishop behavior to know also called a bishop in Haven teeth there's also Would you aware that rostra strategies advise mm Advanced of the take the point where of the teeth But you must know where their fall wrong otherwise they'll never advance So, that's all Program How do you do that is you can you say that your if anyone's messed up in a guru and they have an organization what they have America import your call deprogrammers So if anyone's messed up in good and if they phone at the police or or social workers They put you on to you and then you talk to the person Who's affected and then you make them better and then you go down Tada you see muster this organisation also Whatever you like with loving that won't put them See in this world whatever you say it has always two sides it's a facade Everything has two sides Like if you say this is a place for People to understand religions and their mistakes or whatever it although he just people will be standing against One of the aim would be would it to The people who were the members of Golden Age International they would indicate to the people that they were in contact with that They were employed by sahaja yoga for that purpose. That's what I think. You should keep it out Connection should not do that But what you said you can do is to get some people If they come to you to your organization, you should say that you see some people have told us that sahaja yoga has helped you can track here but We are not recommending, but if you want to Confirm that we are a ferocious and PIDs and all that terrible reintroduction You see you are not to say that it is an Organization of sahaja Yogi's at all even if they won't ask you your sahaja Yogi's they will never drink me See, that's why we have no dress. No badging nothing Written that class circles. That's why I've never allowed many people used to say let us wear Put a pajama. I said nothing even the marks you are not to have anything. That's only secretly Till we reach a certain stage this way so you don't have to sing our surrogates to tell Chelsea is that now? This is doctor daily File all right doctor name fine then. Mr And this that and also you can add up the IDs and all these things This is what they respects not sahaja Yogi's they Think Sergio give needs there must be some criminals using the carrot think that sahaja Yogi's some good people they cannot think of such people who can be really They always fail to be impressed On the depth of knowledge.

It's a knowledge of God And this is self stands up. They don't think to ask where you've got the credentials for Yourself election say about Lucy when I saw Jogi speak see me even a little girl Like an Obama when she speaks people are amazed. How does she go? Every centers that you speak help that sparkle. You see they all know you do not say If there is a beautiful rose somewhere he you know, because it's fun You know the fragrance with that they mean no it is something great You need not say you are sahaja Yogi's by saying that we have achieved nothing with these horrible means Yes, so let us go in another way You see if you talk of The flower nothing works out so talk of the fractals by Flower they are not interested but us have let them have your friend This is another one you can impress by Tula And we have a part of the organization something research into nuclear aspect how to See when you are international see I'm going to But you see peace cannot come from without peace has to come from within See if you don't have nuclear weapons. We'll have some other way now Americans are Look at them. They are selling their weapons to all other countries at a very cheap rate. You see, what is this? this is even worse than having atomic bomb because atomic bomb for once for all finish everyone see But this is very bad to make everybody fight So there are ways and methods Under say it's a temperament it's an attitude. It's the inner circle being which is not flat pieces They're violent, but they have no peace within Actually they enjoy Enjoy How to deal with people Through our connections with them.

They come to sahaja yoga. They see us as as the speakers Because they seen us as as a representative of both International and NEC as Napoleon How we should deal with that situation? You should let people from outside You see for example, you can go to Toronto and let the Toronto people have any me know This better But is not a brand can say I've come from Sydney on the way and we've done so much There in Sydney so much as attached we have found out these and all that who is going to find out about it, right? So in New York you work for sahaja yoga we Need to make like cut clients are willing to pay money See you only one client that is sahaja yoga They don't pay any money Nobody means we have a client as such. How can there be except for these boos? Because we talk against them they're not piercing I don't think this question will arise This client In this in this relationship we are generation You see what will happen now, we'll have let's see. We will either go to these gurus Alright, so they come to because we are saying we are giving alternative this thing, but when you will go and see them All right, we will give you a publicity this thing that thing but we tell the truth You should tell them that you see we are here But we tell the truth because that's what we have written in our this day and you try to see the truth in it you see so they would like to have you there because we have a sort of a position to tell the truth you say So you can go there are any journalist goes and he can say whatever he likes they cannot stop. So you worship the Flaws of that thing and then you can write about them and tell about them This is what we have seen So there won't be I mean if they they force I don't think they'll pay you for telling all these things but even even if they pay You can tell them that our see the voluntary organization and we are doing this one III work Like that or if I take the money what so we throw it in the tips for this it itself If somebody comes along once a publicity campaign about self so Well public relations flow as well as selling something like so how'd you get it could also sell 400 We won't have any magazine or anything. Yeah, but in the same way that The members of the organization could go to the media Trying to interest them in publishing material about sahaja yoga That facility could also be used for other Money-making concerns like a surf making firm could come to the Golden Age Internet to employ that organization to give cheap set Quality image or You see there is the possibility of a legitimate business and honest business around the dishonest What Michael is appointed Michael is raising In other words, it could be the possibility of some members of the organization becoming totally involved and financially I see what I'm saying these things again. Take you to the same.

So the year escape See now you can play out certain things like Something like that we can see that We can have a Say we can get some sahaja Yogi's to say that This special type of sugar is vibrated for us Has done you good so you can refer to some organization saying that this sugar is available from this state or say Genuine things like genuine food or something, you know mean more of the genuineness If you can work out say soaps now are made here about horrible chemicals if you can get something Genuine you see On that could be done later on like that whichever is genuine thing, but we have to test it and see for ourselves Things like that we can work out. If you go to them should be genuine stuff, which is helpful otherwise you see we cannot go on for anything cheap type thing like For liver patients we can say we have a medicine or something. All right For you all right Mother I used to be an illustrator I might worthless in the New York Times and Psychology Today and so forth and I've been wanting I've been wanting to use my artwork in some way I know it has the potential to be beautiful if I was working for a good cause such as dodgy Oh and not just my own my own feelings Is there any way that I could help that I could this says they will make full use of it I'm going to use all of you, but this I'm already using All right You have to find out all the talents in this kind of world to see but Now for example David's father is so too honest a fellow I must He may give in your secret, I hope David you have changed a little bit it's too straightforward You cannot believe them so you have to play a drama you have to be an artist to play that reminds me I'm a myself hopelessly back so I'm out of it You say I just can't do it and just love people so don't take me but you have to be careful If you give in the secret, then we are all take few. But those who can keep the secret All right, at least when you are representing it outside, you have to be very careful So to see all the sahaja Yogi's know each other immediately there's a lag gap all of them sitting there and just start giving the bundle as I have it you see I thought of Anybody like Cunningness I should say this horrible cutting people, you know, you have to be very careful if you start giving out your secrets by any method I would say when Phil is another very over honest fellow you see So you shouldn't try to be over always to see here over on us Then they find you not a fact that we know this is the one To do some practice in drama. Have you ever taken part in a play? Oh Very much. What about you David did you? Know you better practice little drama. See that's a good idea all those who suffer from over honesty because conscience and all that we are beyond all that we Have to save this firm Search term in the Stars. We can't go on playing with all these Few bits of things that we have.

We have to have the major thing. You have to do something about You could dice the issue will come There is Olympia one You didn't know what If you nicely alright hmm good But you wet yourself, do you know that Handler would see She has got her hair like her mother always combed the hair of the children backwards We use the comb or brush for well That's what you must do - small little brush and give it to me for vibration I think must be on her just average the problem That's how you discover You must use brush for children a popular area of television which is Circled in depth look at some topic For instance a program perhaps half hour program on Hill On such a television program Would you be willing for instance to talk on aspects of health? in a program which would contain So-called medical experts who would in fact attempt to refute the things that you were saying the interesting is that Just now issues will come up yourself. See if you put me there also Yoga there everything will be shocked and then you find you but first you have other people you see Build them up bring other gurus to them like that and the way you didi Okay later on I can be there. But first you prepare it now Don't that Any other solutions We have fried it you see what we did was over, dr. Sivana he was there on the kid Cancer Research and She wanted to talk about it. He is doing that and He wanted to tell other people nobody was willing to listen to it, and they thought he was going to matter What is he was there he was doing that Nobody knows about it. He was doing research in When he went and told them that this is possible this is this they said no no resolve no matter how can that Because they cannot believe there is something higher source from where you get all You see they all thing in then ego behavior that it is all their own achievements They do not want to believe in it because their existence will be zero See they asked me in India that if I make this institute for research we get a big What you call donation from the government but trusted what is there to be research here? I'm an avid research everything I have know everything what is there to be research in sahaja yoga And what do we are we going to do be the donation that them there was no land nothing but even then you see They want you to research And the organization is for research. If you say there's a solution then either prevention does not it They are not really doing it actually to find out so they are How would you make the program you already have So where can you be these programs that would be on the contrary you go and talk to them as a neutral body All right, you tell them all right You would like to study you would like to this is one of the alternatives we agree accept But after all we are journalists we have to witness for all right You guys I see there loopholes and you put them up. I have never done it They are exposed all the Guru's like this in the state That's very simple Now first you do this then you come to sahaja yoga also also criticize it in a way Which is not really please remember to great about What did you criticize her Yoga for what did you say?

Related to Some of the practices like Foot surfing and and time and soul. That's right. It was very time consuming a lot of people gave a lot of time In other words, what are you going to do time when you go to the pocket of the time of something or You see what I'm saying? That if anybody wants to refute it, it's very good. We really want. Otherwise we are more stupid So what you can say say, for example if you want to criticize sahaja yoga I get kinda Selected you can't see from the finger You can't say one thing that there are some people Who still are not Anywhere near a good person or something that you can say that But some of them look excellent many of them really So maybe there is an inner circle some sort of a doubt Everything is not Like that you can put it in You see something to say that there's something secretive about these people a little bit everything is not born first, perhaps It is said that all knowledge will be exposed to you, but partly is known And everything everyone doesn't know that's what we gathered from some other people who are saying that we are not allowed to certain functions Or something like that. So you see a class consciousness is there? That we have some social is to raise their years Or But when I are somebody he told me that he came to this face when he was done later See, this is the first pretty slow then we diffuse And somebody can go and say I was just dying when I came here and mother saved me. So I do it perfectly. Alright You see that is the second away you should give them some photographs of when you came Before and after First you must educate them what they should expect First you have to tell them what they should expect wrong realization No, no, no, you can cover it with a paper or something eat up silk cloth Then 25th, you will give them realization What you don't realize Asian how will you make them understand No, you can say after say halftime you can say that let's try if you can We have public meetings they're always invited but you have public meeting every week When this course is from people who are coming some public meeting Well the idea arose because Tian was doing introductory We See as we will because a lot of people were very displeased with the TM plus they know it was an absolute ripoff Now what you can do is to talk to them that You see this is the thing this month this Kundalini is here this thing that But a mantra unless and until it is awakened By a realized soul is relatives This is you must write this stage has to awaken mistake you like that you can tell them the preparing but it is to be awakened and this should happen to a person and if it happens and Then if it has I mean when we have the publicly What do you do that I'm in The how do you say these people won't come to the publicity These people won't come to the public meeting How do you stop them coming to the public meeting well Then what can you do?

That was the point we open our service is that lecturers free but other education institute will charge people to come under force or If we can say to them that the public meetings are in How many people come for public meetings you writer And how many will be coming for your course I know the mother charging mother TM experience Now the public meeting of these 20 people is always twenties it they don't increase So let us not have it as a public meeting there you are See I would say this one you started - So it would be so why do you have any public meeting at all? Why I am saying for these twenty sweet sweet if they have a big party, what you can do is to have them in Dodgeville And he's not advertised Let us see that what sound better If only 2-3 people are coming every week you see Supposing they get about fifty people for this Kind of a training center Then best thing would be that they should go for the training center And you should have your thing in - from now. You've got an actor just like as you have here I told somebody else to form It's alright feeling from I think young Bring me a you keep plate. All right, I'll take it in that Anita because this is too much fun Yeah, we'll keep it here. I'll take out immediately. You know that you played turn. Yes. I Look so big, but I don't know All right, so this is a good idea now What we can do is to have this force down there and just like as you are having here Because in the public meeting now as you will be busy with Geneva and all that also, isn't it? You saw Joe he is 20 or whatever it is. Then we get some people in the ashram we got food there So yoga center and is in a public media and let the people come down there And also I don't think giving realization so quickly is a good idea.

That's what Christine. Peace But mother if you give them so quickly they get lost or in my presence is all right You can always sit with mothers with the realization is not so they think it's something special Otherwise, you know what happens that they think oh, you can give realization. You can user they have no value You see because their value system is wrong. First of all. Secondly, they have no sense of relaxation So better to prepare them for it and then give me you see if you give it to a man man say five powers What does it make? It's like that We practice about nightingale a And hopefully I win today's Wednesday When they have this Good idea because you see free practice with them they will give you ideas. Literally I Saw that what you keep. Oh Good, I can do that here will be good and everybody can give you ideas Just taken away the whole food. Oh, I see otherwise, I thought it's either the whole or nothing I sometimes don't understand the language of sahaja Yogi's Thank you, but I would like to have a sponsor all right. Yes too much easy If I see too much, then I would eat so better bring a small plate that I'll take something.

Hmm. Thank you That's a good idea you practice it here so that will be corrected we know what is Now what we can have this golden age one can organize a Program inviting people to Come from all kinds of things and to prepare papers and to read them and Then the sahaja Yogi's should be in the audience And they should ask questions with other people Here in London, I don't know what they do. That's all But They have been organizing yoga seminar something inviting people even from India, so What we can do for alternative living we can organize one and there We can get sahaja Yogi's to ask them directly to These people, and also I sahaja yogi should give a speech who is not a member of this secret group you say Properly not Openly not at all. Not at all, but it can happen openly also in a way because when it will come to sahaja yoga see it's so saying that it's a dark night and The people from your family are only serving so have it it's like that see the dark night nobody sees And your family people are serving all the food so you have the best like that Yes, it is obviously did not or apparently tis not we can say but really it is Otherwise, what are we interested in? Not only sahaja yoga, but saving of people I Mean you have tried everything else, isn't it? Laughing? Nobody listens first, we are nothing Just to be honest, ooh And we imagine this college how far we are gone And I hope you get that book coming from somewhere Well this some people get the board, you know when we approach him and we talk about religion, of course most people Get bored Vibrations but some people Know as well as I can I when the sahaja Yogi's I Want to teach Sergio can spread sahaja yoga must undergo an under? training what to taught how to draw how to honey Is very important and those 26 lectures that we are going to have your head Whenever it is possible, I would also like to come see How it works out what what we should talk you have one of these subjects somebody should handle How should we talk to people now? Should we begin? See, let us understand the master.

We have to approach them the way they are I mean do whatever made you think proper there's no objection for that, but you have to understand the whole thing And talk about that. I should go into that head Andy hold a picture inside And the people are really in a richer condition Try whatever is possible that summer work. They're not bothered whether we save them or not. Because how far can you go with them? Let them then Be there with ya. We come up to a point, isn't it? Say at the same time if I spend in India because see thousands of humanity But here you go on pressing them and asking them for distillery were just on their head standing what to do Another can go Very insensitive lethargic And condition These shopping The idea mother is Is this right that sahaja Yogi's approach seekers, but the golden age Promotions golden ages. Yeah, not only remove young people who can they are for the track? We are for media Everything has to be worked out to the making That's better I Can't you see it's like you see asking a job From someone Will not oblige people But he feels he is obliging you Then all the time you with it our God such an obligation like this But as a member of this thing You can do a lot. I'm sure because otherwise helping or that just trying to oblige you personally All the time they'll be Having that in your mind.

So best thing is just to tell them that actually we are obliging them. I'm not they See what The hams brother without a surgery jump our mother but these are managing some public relations when Joshua He did your job very well right person That could be done later on just now we are not to be I need to find a surgeon this one But you can say that that's what the sahaja Yogi's say what try not that you are certain The text we see we just say that we are here as public relations Laura For alternative systems even further Hasn't once If supposing the Catholic Church want us to help them I Have class right now the important The Archbishop's of Canterbury wants to have so much into mine. I'll kill them Stupid people Even though we know that he was wrong in many ways I mean just imagine how stupid their ass. Yeah to allow him to be in the Bible. How is he there? What are you gonna find it? Best was our Archbishop They asked him do you believe in this? In the Immaculate Conception, is it about I'm agnostic Very honest Why are you there? Nobody asking you cannot teach? You cannot answer the questions.

And why are you sitting there you get up? Exactly said ah Somebody asked me well, do you really believe that Phi Sigma said he said, um, I have to have told you already Know that nothing for everything But to him to study the social order or maybe a state of hair, I don't know whatever think about that More a question of how much violence to get Produce Panda how many Buildings have got how many birds have got how many bulbs you have got to strengthen Its at level crystal it is only that less people Are busy counting all the plates in the house all these cups in the house that sort of them. What's a household? Charity Charity Could be a company but we don't have to deal in large financial Basic Voluntary system something wasn't to do Well it a voluntary organization the voluntary arise Because for charity we have no money Neither we take not give so no question charity goes hand in hand with money, but voluntary work anybody can do Voluntary organisation Dunno so yoga has no organization a Partially, I dunno Now people do not turn it into my never get stuff Well, can I be Having secretaries and all that I don't think it would be possible Hmm now so come to other problems of other problems that you have in Gaza What's the problem with re what happened We should You see what I'm saying, I'm telling you one Who were in India? now they have got something settle down try to appreciate don't try to All right No tomorrow somebody comes from Timbuktu now he comes here and then you say you should not be the world. That's not possible So if you want to be kind to me just accept Isis order these just now. All right now while talking is open because I always get pestered by one person telling me another thing and under know about make People have objection I know that they have Hospital or about Kerry and Nick getting together also people have an objection or some sort of now that Way you will have optician far away, I don't say it's perfect. He must be long she must be hot-tempered in the time talking But he's not here to give you realization or me. He's just there to maintain the mobility All right, so you don't have to fight with him all the time and say this sea should do that. Usually whatever he's doing He's not doing anything to harm.

Maybe a little voice there. Definitely. I do not say that. I do not challenge There may be some ego something working it out But for that you should accept that after all these before this world is staying here in screen is very methodical He doesn't give our mother Amy For you people you are free in anything because you love but your space you can always develop your spirit What difference does it make whether you sleep in this room or that way? Do not make issues of nonsensical things for sahaja Yogi's does not be do I do like that Did I ever say that I would like to sleep here or sleep there So one thing must understand we are sahaja Yogi's we are not Ordinary, we have to behave like safe how much the states bear what how do we know say by the way? They are bearing power. They are preparing power the way they are simple the way they are Living with less things the way they are sacrificing We are Saints and I don't know what sort of things All right, I agree even if I say that technique is dominating or if doing something like that, all right Let's somebody organize Like that will not allow anybody to be organizing if everybody has a say in the matter How is it going to work out? But your babies they're absolutely free if you want to enjoy the freedom Wherever you are whatever movement wherever you stay if you are free people You will not create problems those who are not free with it wrong. It's the simplest So no more following on this point, I want to stay in this room and that it's too frivolous and not to involve me It's not so if I am always involved So take everything for granted if you don't want to diminish them you can go away But now let it go on don't give me a headache you have too many things to do So nobody should give me a headache When I find Nick his absolute uses are some dares to do but I'm sure when the others that person comes same probably because your evils are there and if Nick is Organizing you think that is something greater than you. That's the problem.

No, not at all You might be a much greater residue be than he is much greater But he's the one who as time is doing the job. It's all right children Why do you interfere you easy job. I'm not talking about you or any Maybe that you're right. I have not seen you are not maybe you're right. Maybe tell But I am told that some people in the ashram believe that there should be no overriding About living together. We are not reached that stage You have not reached that stage when you reach that stage where you don't need any organisation like these leaves are simple they don't need they grow according to the laws of Who they dominate and who they trouble anybody But when you become that loudly in the spirit in your father's domain Then you don't know how beautiful you there won't be any problem between each other Now supposing say somebody said X is very good and the Y's will be back Til it is not alright, the Y has to be. All right The X should not be satisfied with what he has got see something really should not Y has to be. All right also So what he has to do is to pray for you meeting with you what you want, but you cannot just say that oh I am very good. The other one is no that's not the way sahaja yoga Everybody now say my finger is safe. I won't say cut off my finger.

That's all right I'll try to improve we try to save as much as possible. So That relationship will only develop if you really work out in that way but if you don't want to work out that present there will be No more angles no more than personal Now try to quiet in yourself and be peaceful ashram has to be a place of peace Where peace should decide? God has been so kind to me. Just imagine you are living under such a rule I can't even think of such a thing in modern times. What a beautiful thing. They have done here. Just look at this Have you ever noticed what God has given you to be under this roof? So beautifully done for such a beautiful count your blessings If this is important When you are a realized soul you see nothing but we clear out And then you give you if you give ugliness then you are not a sahaja yogi. Yes here to better improve yourself Why are you talking? And Nick is not the last one so it is not maybe the first one But he is the one who was available, which is good at organizing So I asked him to ominous now you both all of you give you my dear Other words every moment you do something you shall give up.

Will you take up from him? Mr. Harry? All right So that nobody why I am just telling you because just now the problem came from me But you are not the first one. This is that I think the eleventh you So now as he is doing if you are all busy people let me Let you meet the baby is doing it just listen to me nothing important what is important in your spirit, isn't it? Keep your attention on to your spirit and not to these realities And I tell you I have seen in the West people just are trying to find ways and methods of colony. Really as a meat connoisseur, you follow both of this just the same thing, but it's only just to find something if your Father did not do it. Then your grandfather was different like sort of a thing you it's very back tension and very bad attitude Towards each other not of mirth and happiness enjoy and understand and enjoy That time more to be free furniture Um when we go back to New York We're going to try to get an optional bed and I was wondering I'm treating you so hard here any amount of time I've been here I'll give you two the laughington if they get an extra in New York. Maybe you live there Thank you very much thank you, huh. We watch your baby So What is the future what did he say the last Nobody's going to leave that All right, why not everyone you see some new ones are better than the very old ones are similar Sometimes they can act like snakes and either they take it for granted. They think I don't understand You old all these things do not exist in sahaja yoga as long as you love me your aura Also this idea more than Better get rid of it 26 weeks are sufficient to make you if you are one day sahaja, yogi are already old now, but if you are amico then are when you old And then if you are three weeks on then you are absolutely mature fool fool You don't need more than three weeks to be a real sahaja yoga Some of them just get a split of a second Yes, what is it don't kill you rates, yes Yes What is Chaya water husband's ethnic are those for sceptile logo so many covergirl artists Westminister people to send by letters to me 48 Brompton square, huh?

I am no idea You gave me just to check good, but I think I can also write isn't it? the bank All right knowing if you make the letter I decided let us send it to him and get it You see because I have no idea how much money is there You took some money out For our traveling a little bit and I don't know whether they have returned it or not. I don't know I guess it does happen about Also Bank, people are funny if you don't take the accounts immediately They don't give you and if you ask them, they'll say alright, you give us money for that And also it's quite confusing isn't it? So best thing is to keep day-to-day account is the vector It's happened with some another backpack are See first it was sent to Ashley Gardens Now that's sending it to me regards ARCA Kalyan second opted chili there and the Govan will also write I will I will sign them so I can concern Pathan because I don't know what to do No, whatever How am I going to Scotland But then what about any car there a Police might find out from field Whatever money or John here, you'll need it for their expenses, whatever have things because they're still you Never got a job Who else was Macallan wanted to go there?

They're Interested would then you Yes, Brian should be taken help up. He will give you all the idea. We just wanna live forever That's very important. That's your job isn't to see to it that you form this organization. You see how they shine This is yours. You must keep the otherwise. There will be a problem Now what's happening about you Harry you bring me over Can anybody give him a job temporarily we got Beautifully, what is it it should be a good job and what did Not be a permanent You need not be a permanent But supposing it is not that What somebody said that if she can't cover the tourist year she can get married here and then they would not object So the provision here, I'd appreciate a vision about thorough Interview there so they will meet you. So if she was approaching now for that In order to talk to the people you who had employed in that you give us some fear now You won't talk. Somebody should won't talk for you That's the best way to avoid the person come back to me Nietzsche never come back you take somebody with you you can talk Anybody who should say that to see her For the guarantee of this bad thing, I'm a little Discouraging landed on we can ask the next to give you a job temper already coming But he can just offer him a job or something Be better able to joke with John Fulton From reading because I think John is trying to sell the company or something.

And also it's more in keeping with this modification Why not try again? Alright Good idea alright to talk to you is very responsive as possible. Alright, that's done that Any other problem? Well, I've been living here for two weeks and Since I've been here with meditation in the morning hasn't been on time I talk to others about it and I haven't gotten satisfactory answers and just say that people don't get up and Don't understand why or how to correct it what happen? You don't turn this time what I don't understand why it isn't on You're not getting the vibration no meditation doesn't start on time All right. He did all these Lots Where are they lost all English lost their tail courts have gone but still the boxes I have patients. We also have patients They're all not see Morse ladies And gentlemen With lots of object Stay like that lords ladies and gentlemen, I Know in the language they're called lots of Nuts up.

He must have said that in sahaja, yoga you have to get This awesome body Now you must try to keep certain discipline with yourself I said you beat Iran equal to yourself Nichiren that's only way. Can you open the window?

When I called you lots I really tell you are all angry because to become hot It's not a easy thing to be realized and it's not an easy thing to be established as a resource, I must say We have to really work Physical mental emotional hangs up This is only physical my child, but they have other souls And you are do know how one has to manage that. Thank you very much She's come along Growing taller Mother About television story from Australia about the media. It's tender would I be? you were Reminded that we were in Melbourne and I Asked you or we asked you if you would come down very early one day take a very early flight, so that you would be available for the press and for television Two of us travel down the day before and handed out a lot of press reports to the television channel and to the newspapers We'd already had a couple of articles in the newspapers, but we had nothing home television in Melbourne. I Had to meet you Barry I think with something like the plane arrived at 8:00 in the morning so it must have left that You must have been at the airport since sooner after 6:00 And I had lived a final Club Nice to meet you in telling that nothing had been lined up but your day Looked like being completely wasted one You didn't question as to who I contacted and I explained that I've been to two of the television channels Had taken the program from Sydney so they weren't interested anymore and The other two I had to bring back As to whether they were Would Do an item So you were very gracious and went off to the house The felon in the house was out of order and So I had to get out in the car and burn my fan box It was about the fourth fifth or even perhaps six red box Wasn't broken When eventually I got through to Channel seven I Was told by the girl that I've spoken to the day before That oh, I found it. Just the right time because she just come in and she was going out again and Yes, they would be interested in doing a news item and interviewing news Where would that be? Immediately inventing I said pop we meet in the park. It was a beautiful day. So Then I had to go back and I already had to make time as well And this is something I've never done like so I found myself admitting you to an interview At half-past twelve in a park in the middle of the city about 15 miles from where you were So I was like this And when I explained to you you said You looked so disappointed this morning we had to do something And it was a very wonderful interview extremely relaxed and nice you see It depends on your state of mind listen to me if I'm here like, that's all I'm here. That's me does not matter whether I have to Have something or to read something that doesn't matter to me at all Jean I'm here at this point I've come as your mother.

I have to give realization to you How I do it That have you doing So I don't have to worry as to how I do it When I had faced the problem supposing somebody comes before me he is what vibrations or something I woke up But it does not matter with me if he doesn't get realization. I don't get upset myself neither I upset that for another person because if I get upset He'll be much more upset agree that if mother is upset with me when am I going to get realization of it? So that will be much more upsetting But it's not rational with me it's my nature I Am completely at peace with myself. I have no problem. I am NOT disappointed nothing Perhaps there's only one thing that upsets me really There's anything that really upsets me is I find that there is no pure love between you That love is not felt that you are not enjoying the love. You see doesn't matter anything you do, but you love each other That's very important because that's most pleasing But loving doesn't mean some sort of a Nonsense, you people know about that's not the thing. Love is a feeling of wonder of unique or being see Like Jamel once told me He came down to Bombay and he was very seriously even More venomous he came down to London now London is not his place nothing of the time As soon as he came to he threw he felt he belongs basically, and he got all right, and it person and II wanted to meet everyone everybody wanted to That's one of the things You are almost people who have not found each other After so many years of searching for might create problems among yourself nothing at all the rest I look after you just Now for the other people like the media's we seem that You're trying hard my blessings are with you but also it's not yours. Oh you don't have to worry if he does become Alright, we worked that's all karma, Nevada Cara your job is to work happily stay when you You will not just so you will not sort of be a speedier will not be lethargic Nothing, if you stay in the center your speed will be so well balanced that you will not hit anyone But you and everything will move The relationship has to be established to say see, you know tardivo the relationship with the be the relationship with the switch relationship with clutch and With the accelerator legs and all these things Loretta's everywhere is fixed like that. You see and you move with them supposing they all start moving in different direction what will have First establish your relationship That's very important. I be telling you That's first thing and foremost thing is to establish your relations.

Alright? With outsiders and much with outsiders. There's no problem Because you see they are not interested. Why should you worry now? This thing may have formed it's really because we would like to drop with them a little bit. I Don't know. How many will be sent with this. I don't know. Let's see, but it's a big joke No, you have to play with them. Let's see See Creation is not if you are Making any one beings are not But making sahaja Yogi's averse difficult.

It's the most difference You have been made Yogi's in the sense. You have got realization. That's over circle Make coups are Yogi's is not easy So prophet and the prophet work has to be done with peace with understanding Sometimes I really also for my irritation at things because and I find that you are so effective but at The stage where we are now, I feel quite happy in confidence somehow I had a feeling that there's not so much Distrust and domination now with in sahaja yoga. It's not so bad Once it is established. I have nothing to worry about see we have to be a solid Personality once we have that we manage We manage everything no doubt we can't meet But first this is one of the many big things we have done And moreover to see the master people have a very great response. I Can get thousands of them in English. But today we have to fight the intellectuals we have to fight against it we have to fight the Country see the big people so far with them these emotional people the people of Syria who are emotionally bound who are emotionally higher verified Imagine that a person Like say Dumas meets your president. He will just say the madman Were you making me talk to eat with you? Just give him up? He just said this magnet why have you brought me to talk to this?

Madman? That's all the male journalist but back at work, but an intellectual will know because he has gone through all that madness so he knows It's only he can retrace him back not too much the one will just say what this mad move a madman That's all we've done many times like this That's fine because if you have to save these people then we have to have very Good. Sahaja, Yogi's you realize You have problems all those are them they have to be worked out But develop certain of God habits is one of them means father is very peaceful, but Pace is not fast. She doesn't jostle people Try to become a condom And that's only possible when you are solidly holding each other's hands Then there is no Agility or agitation or just Pick me up from what? I forgot I thought some policeman is going to pick me up on Making cut Are we can somebody can drop me? All right Somebody can drop me let it be because he come on the way and then who is better when you drop me there Are you going that side? all right, so What's the other thing How do you teach? You take a pain and functionary You just talk to them and tell them not how you achieved you see mostly their media they have media copy They are not intelligent bright people, you know mediocre Absolutely worried about the wants of people you see must have if somebody has a car You must also have a car if somebody has these you must have this sort of very know them What can you talk? Because to talk to their level a victim They're themselves will come one day to sahaja yoga because not easy to have pointing somewhere. It's Very low level I think the lowest level people go to quality sent it to parties because they think they are more significantly like they're useless So they think that's the best place to go and show your significance.

I tell you the Richard is people do that And those who are good people will never outshine. I Mean I've heard your politicians, I don't tell you much of that No, no They will just have jokes about Now a Queen's party works out sort of thing up nothing serious I Think then it's no connection between them and reality They don't know then they will never experience tightly what they're talking about Even the Socialists when they talk about this and that they are not known forward They don't what are the plans of our time just they're talking us to make a business out of it. That's If you ask them give your one-fourth to somebody we like it You have to be extremely generous and compassionate to be associated step one of them It sell you self-appointed business is you get more how to get more is saying that thing and then do what bring? What get boots in the house invite them feed them? What do they need money? Everything is money oriented and absolutely low level very low level You see food listen to the news especially in England, I don't know what they do another country Then you strike one thing then the founders gonna come down. The dollar has gone and comes out Gold prices or they are asking for so many percentage higher they are asking for so much positive I think there was you losing country. I'm sure The way they are fighting I mean nothing is for cents in whatever Half of the losses that 10% child 15 person for what? And that too they're so miserly whatever money they have they don't put into something fanciful at the most You won't even find their nice teeth up with these not even one nice Teeth why you our industries are going down because nobody wants to buy with you. Only thing that we go up is Whiskey or something like that There's no cultural Look at this I'm with some of your readers a surprise that I am a happy person You know, they're unhappy people make everyone unhappy Those who take to politics are mostly very low type of thing very low mentality They're good for nothing useless people you want to show that's all or my opinion is I draw When it comes to sacrifices they cannot They make everyone find do all kinds of bad things that Take advantage unions.

They what are give the Union Street Spoiling everybody's lives in ideas. Why don't I teach that? You should not drink what could have they done to people? Labor class you. Just tell them not to bring that first English Stop all the for the cops fatality was a real politician. I should say he went all out to stop all the shops of wine and other trace in all Then he stopped people buying foreign foods Hand-woven hands, but everybody should wear whether you are a minister or anything. So a Poor man can wear the same dress or the minister can bet All kinds of things he tried from a Will be pointed there who they are not for you anything at all because they have no sense at all of anything What tissues are no? Don't have to be enlightened but how many politicians will take to sahaja yoga? Can we kick up even wha? What did you say That question of tricky see the thing is they will never even see they haven't got intelligence to see That there is something beyond Apart from tricking some may be good also, but they are not able to see that they have to go beyond these So they may know what is research.
