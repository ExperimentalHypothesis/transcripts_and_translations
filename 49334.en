Shri Mataji: Now the boy has to make an anjali and the girl, I mean the bridegroom and the bride, I mean, the bridegroom has to put their hands together like an anjali as you know. On top of that, the girl has to put her anjali. When the bridegroom's, bride's mother has to put the water. Then the father has to say the following things.

I read it in English and then it will be said [Hindi]. Now the father is saying, "Put your hands, tabnadhyaya, there is one plate.
Babamama: The bridegroom's hand would be under the bride's hand in anjali.
Shri Mataji: No, no, no. Brides, yes. What's brides over?
Babamama: Bride's hand would be above the bridegroom's hand.
Shri Mataji: Put together, touching each other.
Babamama: Touching, touching it, that's right.
Shri Mataji: And there's a plate, hold it below that. Somebody has to hold it. The father has to hold it below. Now pour it carefully.
Babamama: The mother has to pour water.
Shri Mataji: Now here, bride's father is saying, "My daughter is a Sahaja Yogini and she has accepted the Vishwa Nirmal Dharma. Also, I and her mother are followers of Vishwa Nirmal Dharma Considering that, you are the best Sahaja Yogi, I offer my daughter to you in the auspicious and divine presence of Shri Mataji".
So, keeping fully in mind the importance of this great function, please give complete respect to it.

Shri Mataji: Now the bridegroom has to say at this time, all of you have to say, "Of course, I will comply with it, I'll accept it", in your heart. All the bridegrooms have to say that. In Sanskrit, it is ‘Aham Sveekar Omi’.
[Hindi]

Now there's a thread to be tied with a turmeric attached on the left-hand wrist of the bride and the bride should do, so, on the right-hand side of the bridegroom. There's a turmeric.
Babamama: There's a thread with the turmeric.
Shri Mataji: Find out. [Hindi]
First the bridegroom should tie the thread with turmeric attached on the left-hand wrist of the bride. And the bride should do so on the right-hand wrist of the bridegroom. Both say the following.
Babamama: There should be two threads of turmeric, one for the bride and one for the bridegroom. First the bridegroom will tie to the bride and then the bride will tie to the bridegroom.
There have to be two turmeric threads. After the bridegroom has tied to the bride, then the bride has to tie another thread to the bridegroom. [Hindi]
Sahaja Yogi: With this tying of the turmeric thread, both the bride's and the bridegroom have to say this in their minds. I am reading it. Please repeat this in your minds. "It is with the blessings of Shri Adi Shakti that I accept the auspicious bond of this marriage and pray". Now they have to pray in their hearts.
"May the Sahaja Yoga grow.
May the Self-realization grow.
May the satisfaction and peace grow". Then they further say,
"May we always have by the blessings of Adi Shakti the sensitivity of Chaitanya, the life without ego, the joy of Sahaja ethics, the energy and enthusiasm to do the Sahaja Yoga work". After saying all this, the brides and bridegrooms should sprinkle the vibrated akshatas over the heads of each other.

"I am tying the Mangalsutra which is the thread of auspiciousness as that which is of the form of Chaitanya. That which is pure, chaste and auspicious. That which is verily the thread of Chaitanya and auspiciousness and hence it is called the Mangalsutra".

Shri Mataji: Now you have got the shoulder cloth, on the bridegrooms and ladies have the saris so a knot has to be tied by the bride's maid. One corner. Get to the corner, corner. Please get to the corner.
Babamama: You have to move together. It should be tied in such a way that you will be able to move together.

[Conversation in Hindi]

Shri Mataji: Now. The bride and bridegroom have to recite the thing in their hearts.
Sahaja Yogi: Please repeat it after Me in your minds, both bride and bridegroom. "While our shoulder cloths are being tied together in knot, we fully realize that this relationship has been fixed through the Sahaja Yoga and it is only through the Sahaja Yoga that it will become pure and strong".

Shri Mataji: Now there is ‘laja ho’. Before lighting the [conversation in Hindi]- before igniting the light, this mantra has to be said of Shri Ganesha in your heart. He'll read it for you.
Sahaja Yogi: Om gananaam tvaam ganapatim havaam ahe Kabim kave na mupashravastamam Jai sthara jam brahma nam brahma naspata aana Shraddhu vannadi bhi siddha sadanam Vakar thundam aa kaya surya koti samaprabha Nirvignam kurume deva sarva karesha sarvada Om tva meva Sakshat Shri Ganesha Sakshat, Shri Adi Shakti Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi namoha namaha.
Now the mama should ignite the fire.
[Hindi]

Shri Mataji: Now you have to put those
Babamama: Puffed rice
Shri Mataji: Rice, and to worship the fire, first of all.
Sahaja Yogi: Now to start with the aahootis. The bridegroom should drop ghee three times. I am reading the mantra. The bridegroom should drop ghee in the fire, three times.
Shri Mataji: Three times the bridegroom must offer ghee to the fire. Three times.
Babamama: Now you must offer. Please. Now you offer. When he is reciting you offer.

Sahaja Yogi: Now the oblations start. For the oblations you have to drop the parched grain. Shri Mataji: Puffed rice has to be puffed.
Babamama: Puffed rice has to be put together. One minute, one minute. Hold on. When he reads.
Shri Mataji: The bride's brother, if he is there or the father could do, has to give those puffed rice in the hand of the bridegroom. You see all this is very symbolic. Try to understand. This is Agni. Now what is the quality of Agni is, first of all, that it burns. So, and it creates heat. For that, a person who is very heated up you must put some ‘ghee’, means you must try to soothe him.
Also this puffed rice, because it is also that the fire wants food to be consumed. For that, you must put puffed rice to fulfil the hunger of the fire.
Sahaja Yogi: Now with the first oblation the bridegroom say, both the brides and bridegroom they say in their minds, the first oblation please drop the puffed rice into the fire and say it, repeated in your minds.
Shri Mataji: Now listen here. Listen, when you are putting things in the fire, please listen. Sahaja Yogi: While the sacred fire is witness we invoke our own Kundalini's and pray that all our faults, negativity and conditioning be burnt into ashes in the light of the Kundalini.
Shri Mataji: Now Kundalini also moves like fire. She goes against the gravity. But it's a silent fire which soothes everything.
Sahaja Yogi: The second oblation. Take the puffed rice again in your hands. And please repeat what I read in your minds.
Shri Mataji: Listen again listen. Second time.
Sahaja Yogi: "While the sacred fire is witness we promise that we will be like flames in Sahaja Yoga and we shall kindle the flames in others too ". Please drop the puffed rice into the fire.

Now starts the third oblation. Please again take the puffed rice in your hands. I am reading it now repeat in your mind. While the sacred fire is witness, we promise that we shall evolve to maturity all that is immature in us ".
Shri Mataji: I hope you are listening to this. Please listen to what he is saying. It is important you must know what you are doing.
Sahaja Yogi: Now starts the fourth oblation. Please again take the puffed rice. I am reading it. Please repeat after me in your minds. "While the sacred fire is witness, we promise that we shall not support or take the side of those people who are not following the Sahaja Dharma. We also promise that we shall pay great regards to all Sahaja Yogis as they would be befitting to saints and sadhus and extend all hospitality to them". Please drop the puffed rice.

Fifth oblation. Again take the puffed rice in your hands and repeat after me in your minds. "While the sacred fire is witness, we resolve to lead the life with all humility within the maryadas, limits of Sahaja Yoga like the fire which limits itself inside the firewood ,because the Kundalini is the cool power of the Divine Agni within us".
Babamama: You must pay attention to what is being read, because that is very important.
Shri Mataji: After the offering the bride and the bridegroom should stand up. And they have to go round the sacred fire. The bridegroom should lead the bride holding her hand.
For three steps the bride will lead the bridegroom.
Sahaja Yogi: Please the relations, please make sure that the fire keeps burning.

Sahaja Yogi: Please see the seven mounds near the feet.
Babamama: Yes, it should be recollected and made into mounds.
Shri Mataji: If they are disturbed please make it properly seven. Have you seen, everyone has seen if there are properly seven mounds? If you need more rice, they can give you.
[Hindi]

Shri Mataji: Now you have to go round seven times and take seven wows. And after finishing every vow, then you come round and you have to cancel with your foot, one of the mounds. Babamama: With your toe, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: With your, yes, with your Nabhi toe.
[Laughter] to be precise!

With your Nabhi toe you have to cancel. Every time you finish one round, you have to cancel. So seven rounds you have to go round.
[Hindi]
Right Nabhi of your feet. Very precise. Right feet. Not now. When you come round. First round, when you go round you have finished it then cancel. Just a minute. Don't be in a hurry. When we start you have to do it. Now first round has starting still. Now move.

[7:33:43]
Today the people from all over the world, forgetting their races, their castes, communities, religions, their nationalities, are singing together the praise of God. It’s my dream which has come true today.
[Applause]

We have to believe in the totality, in the universality. This universe is one, God has not made them separate. All religions are one, coming from the same source. So, we believe in every religion, we follow every religion and the whole concept of nations is also mythical. The whole world was made one, with lots of rivers, mountains and sea. We have divided them. We have made all these differences, higher, lower, east and west. Look at the sun, it moves in all directions. Look at the Mother Earth, it revolves all the nations, it doesn’t revolve only one nation. It’ our myth. We should get out of our minds, so that this dream of mine will cover the whole universe one day.

Today, I’m feeling extremely happy to see all of you together, to finish all the wars, all the violence, all the immorality, all the deceitfulness, all that is wrong against, is destructive towards human beings, and to create complete benevolence in this world.
May God bless you all.

You go as messengers of peace, love, bliss, and tell them that there is an All-pervading Power.
An All-pervading Power which is everywhere, in every nation, in every person, in every human being and can vibrate. So, nobody should think they are individuals, separated by any such small nonsensical thing. We are all one, living in the ocean of God’s love. Let us all take it in our heart, and tell everyone that we have enjoyed that ocean and let all of you enjoy. And forget all these differences which were never created, no saint has created, no Incarnation has created, but human beings have misused them. All this should go all around the world resounding, the whole world should sing the praise of God. And also the whole human being’s problems must be solved. It’s very easy to solve the problems. Only we need the transformation. You all have powers to transform, to cure, to give all the comfort. And counsel them. All the powers that I have, are for you. I want you to have more powers than Me. And I hope one day that will come, to enjoy all this. 

Today, I’m really enjoying everything, all these marriages, and after that, all this oneness of our extasy.
May God bless you all.
