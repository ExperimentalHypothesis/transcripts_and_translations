The Attitudes

I will be going to India for a puja, as you know, because they say in the West most of the pujas take place and they never have a chance. That’s why I’m going to India.And Navaratri starts from the 4th.

I had hoped in these nine days we’ll clear out so many of your chakras. Of course, I’ll be working on them, but you have to also cooperate, watch yourself, find out what’s wrong with you, why the different chakras are catching.

Now the attitude that we have towards ourselves and towards others has to be now changed in these new circumstances and in this transformation. The Sahaj Yoga lifestyle is not a system. You know that. We don’t want to create any systems, any norms, in Sahaj Yoga. But what we do here is to transform ourselves into Selfhood, into the Spirit state. By that we change our attitudes. If our attitudes are not changed then we have not achieved much in Sahaj Yoga.

The attitude first should be that we have to know that we are on the giving end, not on the receiving end. If that happens to you automatically, spontaneously, then you have achieved it. But supposing it does not happen, then you have to be on the watch out. First of all you must feel the joy of being in the Sahaj Yoga. If you cannot feel the joy then there’s something wrong with you, something wrong with your heart, heart is not clean, you have to clean your heart. 

If you think of your past all the time, or the past of others, then it’s  a wrong attitude	 completely.  You have to be in the present. And the gloom and unhappiness, all these things, are signs that yet you have not become your Spirit. The attitude should be: what joy I can give to others? What I have given to others? And the giving is such a great joy that it cannot be surpassed by any other joys.

So one has to think: what did I do for others? How did I help others? How much love have I given others? How much understanding I have of others? Unless and until you develop that kind of an attitude, you cannot enjoy life.

People think the enjoyment depends on others: “The atmosphere is bad. I’ll be happier in India, not here”. [This attitude is] very common. It’s not so. If you are fully aware that you are the Spirit you can enjoy all the other Sahaj Yogis which are here.

So a person who cannot be collective shows that he is yet to be very much developed. It is not how much you have studied, what personality you have got, what kind of education we have had, that’s not important. How much you can enjoy, in whatever may be the circumstances, that capacity shows your identification with the Spirit. You can see me, you have seen my life, how I can adjust myself to any circumstances. A thousand and one things I can do without getting worried about it, or upset about it. I am not saying that you can achieve all that, but still you should have your ideals before you.

Now the part where we fail is that we start finding faults with others. This is the worst attitude. That makes you angry, because you think that you are in charge of everything. I have been people going on the road, they see, say, for example, a funny person passing through, or they find somebody who is not wearing a proper dress, or maybe he is walking in a funny manner. Immediately they get angry. As if they are the policemen, as if they are in charge of the road, as if they have to correct the whole world and as if they are perfect. In Sahaj Yoga, if you try these old tricks, you can never be happy.

Here you don’t have to see those things, just close your eyes when you see any defects of another person. Such a person is always an angry person, because he finds the whole world is after his life or he finds that he has to get after the whole world: one of the two. It’s a funny existence. It’s a very disgusting, frustrating existence, where you are all the time angry with others or angry with yourself. This anger goes on multiplying, and once it goes on multiplying then you become nothing but a mountain of anger. With the slightest touch you get angry. 

Then they say, “This is our conditioning.” It’s not, but this is what you have gathered in this lifetime. It has nothing to do with your previous lives or anything, nothing to do with your bhoots. Now there’s one common thing in the West [which] is, “This is my bhoot!” As if to have a bhoot is a very big honour!  In India nobody would say that, nobody would accept they have a bhoot. Because to say you have a bhoot means you are a nonsensical person. How can you have a bhoot? That means there is something definitely wrong with you, you are a weak person, there’s something missing in you.

So one has to understand the attitude towards life is to be like this that, you give others joy, not find faults with others. This attitude has to be completely changed, of finding faults with others.

Now, finding faults with yourself is also not necessary, because every day you are changing, every day you are blossoming, every day you are evolving. So it doesn’t help to find faults with yourself. Like many people tell me that, “Mother I am a very miserable creature and I don’t know what to do with myself and this and that. And I have been always like this. I have been always an unhappy person.” What is the need to be like that? If you have been like this you have been a stupid fool! That’s what you have been. (laughter) By God’s grace you have everything: what is there to be miserable like that? “From my childhood I have been like this.” So what? If you have been from childhood you have been a stupid fool, that’s what. It doesn’t give you a better place in society if you say, “it is from my childhood.” Get rid of it!

So complaining like this all the time that, “You see, I’m good for nothing. I’m a failure. I cannot fit into this.” We have no norms I have told you. We have no norms. We have no systems. It’s nothing like it should be a Georgian house or it should be a Victorian house, and if it is not then it is fussy; that’s not in Sahaj Yoga.

There’s no pattern set for Sahaj Yogis. But what is set is that you are the Spirit. You are free people. You are yogis. You are kings. Not like these modern kings where even their dress is decided by parliament. You are free. You are free people; free people to understand what makes you happy and what makes others happy. So respect the freedom of others. To be overpowering on someone, to all the time say, “Oh this is it!” asking  a hundred questions [is] not necessary.

I have seen myself [that] people torture me like this. Like I went to a place and there’s a lady who comes to look after me. Very sophisticated she is. So she’ll ask me, “Mother, will you sleep on the right side or the left side?” I said, “I don’t know! Why is it necessary?” “No, I would like to know which side I should place the lamp.” I said, “Whichever side you place I can turn round and put it on!” (laughter) Then she’ll ask, “Which hand you use for the soap?” I said, “Whichever is needed! What is so great?” She said, “But then I should have put it on the left or the right?” I mean, I am not a machine that I go to the left only! I can go to the right as well! (laughter)

And she pestered my life; I told her that, “Please, will you please now do not make me into a computer. Will you please go and leave me alone. I can manage myself.”

So this kind of a system we don’t have. We are not to computerise ourselves. We are free people. This is one thing we forget: we are free people. When we are free we respect the freedom of others and we enjoy their freedom as we enjoy our own freedom. This is a very important principle of Sahaj Yoga.
