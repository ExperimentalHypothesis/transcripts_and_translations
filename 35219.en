Talk Language: English | Transcript (English) – Draft

Please be seated.

I will be going to India for a puja, as you know, because they say in the West most of the pujas take place and they never have a chance. That’s why I’m going to India. And Navaratri starts from the 4th.

I hope in these nine days we’ll clear out so many of your chakras. Of course, I’ll be working on them but you have to also cooperate, watch yourself, find out what’s wrong with you, why the different chakras are catching.

Now the attitude that we have towards ourselves and towards others has to be now changed in these new circumstances and in this transformation. The Sahaja Yoga lifestyle is not a system. You know that. We don’t want to create any systems, any norms in Sahaja Yoga. But what we do here is to transform ourselves into Selfhood, into the Spirit state. By that we change our attitudes. If our attitudes are not changed then we have not achieved much in Sahaja Yoga.

The attitude first should be that we have to know that we are on the giving end not on the receiving end. If that happens to you automatically, spontaneously then you have achieved it. But supposing it does not happen, then you have to be on the watch out. First of all you must feel the joy of being in the Sahaja Yoga. If you cannot feel the joy then there’s something wrong with you, something wrong with your heart, heart is not clean, you have to clean your heart. 

If you think of your past all the time, or the past of others, then it’s a wrong attitude completely. You have to be in the present. And the gloom and unhappiness, all these things are signs that yet you have not become your Spirit. The attitude should be: what joy I can give to others? What I have given to others? And the giving is such a great joy that it cannot be surpassed by any other joy.

So one has to think: what did I do for others? How did I help others? How much love have I given others? How much understanding I have of others? Unless and until you develop that kind of an attitude you cannot enjoy life.

People think enjoyment depends on others. “The atmosphere is bad. I’ll be happier in India, not here” - very common. It’s not so. If you are fully aware that you are the Spirit you can enjoy all the other Sahaja Yogis which are here.

So a person who cannot be collective shows that he is yet very much developed. It is not how much you have studied, what personality you have got, what kind of education you have had, that’s not important. How much you can enjoy in whatever may be the circumstances, that capacity shows your identification with the Spirit. You can see me, you have seen my life, how I can adjust myself to any circumstances. A thousand and one things I can do without getting worried about it, or upset about it. I am not saying that you can achieve all that but still you should have your ideals before you.

Now the part where we fail is that we start finding faults with others. This is the worst attitude. That makes you angry because you think that you are in charge of everything. I've seen people going on the road, they see, say for example, a funny person passing through or they find somebody who is not wearing a proper dress, or maybe he is walking in a funny manner. Immediately they get angry. As if they are the policemen, as if they are in charge of the road, as if they have to correct the whole world and as if they are perfect. In Sahaja Yoga if you try these old tricks, you can never be happy.

Here you don’t have to see those things, just close your eyes when you see any defects of another person. Such a person is always an angry person because he finds the whole world is after his life or he finds that he has to get after the whole world: one of the two. It’s a funny existence. It’s a very disgusting, frustrating existence where you are all the time either angry with others or angry with yourself. This anger goes on multiplying and once it goes on multiplying then you become nothing but a mountain of anger. With the slightest touch you get angry. 

Then they say, “This is our conditioning.” It’s not but this is what you have gathered in this lifetime. It has nothing to do with your previous lives or anything, nothing to do with your bhoots. Now there’s one common thing in the West [which] is, “This is my bhoot!” As if to have a bhoot is a very big honour! In India nobody would say that, nobody would accept they have a bhoot. Because to say you have a bhoot means you are a nonsensical person. How could you have a bhoot? That means there is something definitely wrong with you, you are a weak person, there’s something missing in you.

So one has to understand the attitude towards life is to be like this that you give others joy, not find faults with others. This attitude has to be completely changed, of finding faults with others.

Now, finding faults with yourself is also not necessary, because every day you are changing, every day you are blossoming, every day you are evolving. So it doesn’t help to find faults with yourself. Like many people tell me that, “Mother, you know, I am a very miserable creature and I don’t know what to do with myself and this and that. And I have been always like this. I have been always an unhappy person.” What is the need to be like that? If you have been like this you have been a stupid fool! That’s what you have been. (laughter) By God’s grace you have everything: what is there to be miserable like that? “From my childhood I have been like this.” So what? If you have been from childhood you have been a stupid fool, that’s what. It doesn’t give you a better place in society if you say, “it is from my childhood.” Get rid of it!

So complaining like this all the time that, “You see, I’m good for nothing. I’m a failure. I cannot fit into this.” We have no norms I have told you. We have no norms. We have no systems. It’s nothing like it should be a Georgian house or it should be a Victorian house and if it is not then it is fussy; that’s not in Sahaja Yoga.

There’s no pattern set for Sahaja Yogis. But what is set is that you are the Spirit. You are free people. You are yogis. You are kings. Not like these modern kings where even their dress is decided by parliament. You are free. You are free people; free people to understand what makes you happy and what makes others happy. So respect the freedom of others. To be overpowering on someone, to all the time say, “Oh this is it!” asking hundred questions - not necessary.

I have seen myself people torture me like this. Like I went to a place and there’s a lady who comes to look after me. Very sophisticated she is. So she’ll ask me, “Mother, will you sleep on the right side or the left side?” I said, “I don’t know! Why is it necessary?” “No, I would like to know which side I should place the lamp.” I said, “Whichever side you place I can turn round and put it on!” (laughter) Then she’ll ask, “Which hand you use for the soap?” I said, “Whichever is needed! What is so great?” She said, “But then I should have put it on the left or the right?” I mean, I am not a machine that I go to the left only! I can go to the right as well! (laughter) And she pestered my life; I told her that, “Please, will you please now do not make me into a computer. Will you please go and leave me alone. I can manage myself.”

So this kind of a system we don’t have. We are not to computerize ourselves. We are free people. This is one thing we forget: we are free people. When we are free we respect the freedom of others and we enjoy their freedom as we enjoy our own freedom. This is a very important principle of Sahaja Yoga. That you do not put your things onto others.

Now for example, it's a very common thing, "I can see your vibrations, you are very bad." That's no good. If you feel somebody's vibrations are bad or anything try to be away from that person, it's different. But you need not say that to them because that hurts the personality of that person, that person feels hurt and then that person goes to another person and say that, "Alright. I can see the vibrations. You have very bad vibrations." Then he will say to the dog, he'll say to anything .... That's not the way the make it cheap like that. You shouldn't talk for vibrations so cheaply. "Let me see your vibrations." You are not to judge other's vibrations better judge yours.

Have you understood your own vibrations? Have you corrected yourself? But that doesn't mean, again, you condemn yourself, "Mother, I've been catching throughout my Left Agnya, what to do." Why don't you get rid of it? It's very simple. Left Agnya is the easiest thing to get rid of. You know the mantras, you know what to do then get rid of it. But, no, you see .... That's a kind of an indulgence also some people have, "Oh, I've got a Left Agnya." Then everybody should worry about that person, sympathize with that person, bring candle, burn his clothes, burn him, burn everything. And then they start crying, "Oh, God, what is this."

This is the habit which has come from [UNCLEAR] I should say, that we have had parents like this, we might have had grandparents like this, we must have had someone like that and also now we are following their footsteps. And might be we must have read some novels of that kind where we must have seen some people are all the time miserable and we want to be miserable like them. We might be just trying to become like them, it's just a miserable creature because I read in a novel that such and such person, like in Wuthering Heights, somebody was a very unhappy person so I'm becoming like that. Now you are not in the times of Wuthering Heights now nor anybody is writing about you, nothing. You are a normal Sahaja Yogi. These are all abnormal characters which have been painted just for you to see these are abnormal characters. Now immediately you become identified. So all these identifications are justifications and it's nothing but a means of troubling others, that's all. They are so boring, such people are extremely boring. You don't like them really. People just shun away from them because they think these people are all the time bothering us with their own personal nonsensical things or some sort of an identification they have or they read some book - immediately they become that. How can you become like that? Why can't you become the Spirit which you are?

All these misconceptions, misidentifications, misappropriations are to be given up. We have to take to reality. We have to take to truth and truth is joy giving.

Now the word, as I said, "problem" is a recent word in the English language, they never had it before, I tell you. In geometry only we used to learn when I was young. In geometry only there was a problem. We never had a problem otherwise.

Now there is problem. This is not a thing one can eat, this can be soaked. Who brought this one? This is too much. [Shri Mataji laughs] They expect me to eat this, eh. Rather too much. Hard bhoots, I must say. [Everybody laughs].

So when we laugh we should laugh aloud, open, we are free people. Now there should not be a laughter which is signed by some Elvis Presley or someone that, "You should smile like this: only two teeth must be seen" and this and that. That's not for Sahaja Yogis. They are mukt (liberated), they laugh, they smile the way they like. But what I find is so many people, you see, just to show me that they are very happy are just grinning at me, like this. I said, "What's this? Is a bhoot grinning or you are grinning at me? Which one is?" So, you see, it's a natural spontaneous bubbling joy that should be seen on the faces of Sahaja Yogis.

Now if you want to take, say a simple example I'll tell you. I went one day climbing up a very high hill with my son-in-law and daughter. And there was a big temple there so we had to go there. It's called as Palitana. And by the time you go there you really get absolutely sick because three miles you have to walk and go up. We went and set down, the hot [UNCLEAR] so we set down. And then suddenly I saw all the beautiful elephants they have made in the stone and every elephant has a different type of a tail twisted. When my son-in-law and my daughter were absolutely spread, both were fed up and they were sitting there somehow waiting for the water to come in and I said, "Look at these elephants. See how they've done it. Every tail is differently twisted." They said, "Mommy, this is really .... At this time how can you see the tails of the elephants?" I said, "This is what I see because I just now .... There is no water so better to see the tails of the elephants."

And that's how you feel better, you feel younger, you feel happier, you feel dynamic, you can do ten things without bothering. But it's the human nature I think to show off that you are extremely unhappy to gain some sort of sympathy. That little work you will do and ten times you will tell that, "Oh, God, I went down to the shop and then I climbed up, and then I went to the counter, and then I bought this, and then I had to pay the money. Then I had to ..."

[Laugh explosion from the children and Shri Mataji.] Look at the children, that's what it is. Children are enjoying this because they know they do it like this, all these nonsensical things should not be done at all. It has to be a very simple joyous state. It should be said, "You have brought something. That's alright." Eat it nicely, happily. You don't have to say, "I did this." Better not give but keep it with you, it's like that.

So every time I'm going I have to give you some sort of a message and this time is that you enjoy yourself. Every time I say this, "Enjoy yourself." I hope you understand why I say that. It's a mantra. There is a mantra today that "enjoy yourself", your Self, your Spirit. Enjoy your Spirit in Nirananda. You should drench yourself in that. You'll be surprised all so-called problems, all so-called pressures, all these things just will die out. It's only your mental conception, your mental ideas and the forms and systems from which you are coming out, that's why.

You have certain ideas about people which are not truth. They are all evolving, they are all coming out of it. Even the societies which are not Sahaja Yogis are changing around you. You are the ones who are changing all this. You see, like a little child, one little child and he runs - he makes you so happy. That's is sufficient to make you happy. In the same way so many Sahaja Yogis in England should change the society of England, no doubt. But let us see how much we have transformed, how much dynamism we have.

Now, I have no problem, as usual. But there is one thing that you could call a problem for England - the Shudy Camp. Now Shudy Camp to become Shudy Camp needs people to work it out. But those people who have some talent should go, everybody for a picnic. Still it is not ready for picnic. It is ready for some work, people who want to go should enlist their names with Gavin or someone. Or I think Dr. Spyro can look after that side. And you inform them that, "We would like to go." and "We can do this work." Go there and work it out. And I'm sure it will be ready very soon for us to have picnics. But before having picnics we have to work and working is same as a picnic. Working is same to a picnic if you know how to enjoy it. Everything is picnic, everything is enjoyment. Nothing is a pressure for your, nothing is a dull thing for you, nothing of the kind.

So you are the ones who can make the whole country very joyous and the whole world very joyous.

May God bless you.

So today to make it joyous still I thought I must make the children joyous first of all. So we've got for some children .... For children I've got some small, small things. Now what do we have for children.

[Shri Mataji gives gifts first to the baby girls - a doll, and the little girls - paper umbrellas.]

Those who are going to have babies and think they will have girls can also have. [Laughter]

[Shri Mataji then gives gifts to the boys; the bigger girls receive cloths for puja dresses.]

[Few ladies that have been cooking in Shri Mataji's house receive kitchen aprons.]

I could have got you something better but just for the time being, it's just a consolation prize.

Now I want all of you to write letters to each other and to other people in India. You come back from India and nobody writes to them, they can't understand. You must make more friends. For that I've got you something. Now those who really promise they will write should come. You should be below, I think, thirty years of age. Come along, below thirty years. Write some poems. You must start writing all of you. Write some poems, some good letters to your friends. Must have some friends also. Very simple but symbolic. [Sahaja Yogis receives writing pads.] This is Kingdom-bound. You are bound by the Kingdom of God. Now you must write. You are all writers. Write about Sahaja Yoga. Now that's the last, exact, can you imagine. [clapping of hands].

All those remaining below thirties. Below thirties remaining people. Below thirties [few Sahaja Yogis receive a pen]. Anybody exactly thirty? [laughter] Exactly. [applause after the last pens are handed out].

[Shri Mataji puts in her lap the shawls to be gifted.]

Now we have to respect the elders, the leaders, you see. First of all we have to respect the architects and people who have come all the way from Australia and other places. That's very important. So first of all I would say we have got Michael [UNCLEAR family name] who's come all the way, give him a hand. Now we have Paul who's done tremendous job, I must say. Who is the third person, Robert? This one is for Mark who does all my framing, everything and who is really working very hard. Is he here? He is not here. [arrangements are made to give the shawl to Mark.]

[next gifts are watches].

Now the last ones who are working there, one is John who is doing very good work, John Watkinson. [UNCLEAR name]. Pat is here? Laurent? Ken, is he here? And this is Anita for cooking for all of us. [long applause]

[walking canes]

We thought of Djamel, Ean.

One for [UNCLEAR, name]. How are you? Yes, of course, complete freedom, absolute. Nobody can [UNCLEAR] [The elder Sahaja Yogi: I am a free man.] Of course, you are, absolutely. Not many but you have so many powers. You have so many powers of giving freedom to others, liberation to others. May God bless you. Thank you.

Which is the fourth one? Zim? Be comfortable.

This is from Mrs. Gupte who has come from India. She wants to give it to seven married ladies who are not Indians. [saris]. I'll call, sit down, I'll call one by one. [Names sound like: Antoinette, Dilmet, Esther, Lora, Ruth, couple of ladies came directly to Shri Mataji.].

These ones are for other married ladies. Those married ladies who are collective are to be really praised. And there should be more of these because we had only seven saris so I didn't know. But there are so many who are very collective and good married ladies. This is for all the married ladies. Somebody can pass on, raise your hands. But those who have been good wives, keep your fingers crossed. Good wives. Valery come along, you can make a panjabi out of this.

Who else? All of you tell me unanimously one name of a good wife who is being very, very good. Pat? Come along, Pat. [last sari]. I didn't want to do it because people may say that I'm favouring her. So it's nice that you all have acclaimed, I'm very happy.

[carpets]

One for Gavin, one for Doctor .... , one for Doctor Spiro.

I hope all the ladies got these pieces. And for the men, we have got here khadi curta cloth. And I think those who want can come and collect it from here, those who haven't got anything. But they have to be good Sahaja Yogis without any baddha. [laughter]

Only married people. Must improve your marriages. It should not be given to Indians, because Indian can always get it.

[Names mentioned: Benoit, Alan, Derick].

Now you decide whom to give this one. The best husband, not henpecked. [Name sounds like Nevit Paul] Very good husband. [applause]. Now, you see, both of them have got an acclaimed position so they will not argue with each other. [laughter].

Now finished? Should we go?

[Shri Mataji receives a present.]

This is from all of you to Mrs. Gupte. [gift is handed to Mrs Gupte]

This is from my land. [Shri Mataji touches a plate with soil on it.] You can put it here for anybody .... Shudy Camp, somebody should take it. You can take it, Robert.

If you allow me I will buy out of this ticket money all the brass. Where is the list?

So I have to tell you one thing before I go. We have to give hand to Michael who has come all the way from Canada. [long applause]. He has come here all the way to help me to do my book because you know I'm so busy as doing nothing. So he's come to help me. I would say if you people have tapes or anything, if you can do some transcription and can send him over whatever you have done in printed form or in typed form. He will be able to adjust it. Anyone who has done anything so far, please send it.

What about Douglas? He is not here? Alright. And we must really say that it has been bit too much the way people have been asking him. Now he's spent so much time about you. This one is tremendous task which we have to somehow manage. And Douglas if you can help me, I'll be very thankful. Alright.

Now the people who came to Sahaja Yoga in the beginning like Douglas, Gavin, Moreen, all these people have been of very great help to us. And they have been really, really being the foundation. Now we all have to create an atmosphere of one unity, one huge house of benediction, house of benevolence. It is to be built in the way William Blake has described. All of us are important, right from foundation to the roof. And the symbol is Shudy Camp just now which we have to work out.

Everybody is here, it's all symbolic. I don't want to take everybody's name who has helped so much from the very beginning of Sahaja Yoga. But understand that everyone matters, everyone is important and any brick which is weak will make the building weak. So we all have to work it out in such a way to find out what have we done for Sahaja Yoga. It's not necessary money, it's not necessary any kind of labour but it's the attitude, again I say. What sort of attitude you have had and what sort of attitude you are going to have.

There may be someone who didn't get anything. I mean I didn't give anything, nothing worthy but they will start, "Why didn't Mother call us? Why didn't Mother say ...?" That's not the way. There is nothing wrong with you. After all, it's just a symbolic thing. If this hand has got it, this hand also got it. We are all one. Just to have a little fun we arranged this thing and we all enjoyed the fun. And go with the same feeling of enjoyment. Not to think, "Why Mother didn't do this for me? Why she didn't do it?" Nothing of the kind. Alright?

You promise that you all will enjoy yourself. May God bless you.

So many people have been of help, that's endless. I mean, I cannot take their names to this extent. And in every way they've been of help to us. We should just see how much we can help, just enjoy that. And see for yourself that you should be able to enjoy ourselves so that others can enjoy.

Any questions?

You are from Bristol, are you? Where do you live? You are the doctor? I met you, isn't it, before? You're looking very much better and younger. What about your problem, it’s alright?

What is it? Thank you very much. [children hand gifts to Shri Mataji]

There is Midlands I'm worried about. I'm worried about the whole of England I should say, but more Midlands. This problem is there. Let's see how it works out. It's all politics, I think. Politics, nonsensical politics, that's all.

Thank you very much.

[Sahaja Yogis talk to Shri Mataji about purchases to be made for Shudy Camp and exchange rate of the pound.]

You all who want to go [to India] should immediately tell Gavin about it. Or you want to get married. He is going to give you a proper form for the marriage. I have told them to make one. Those who want to get married should fill in the form properly. And see for yourself that whatever you have said is the truth. Those who are already engaged will be married but those who want to get married also should say that, "We want to get married." and everything should be truthfully written down.

May God bless you.

[Sahaja Yogis sing: Mataji, your face shines like a thousand suns ...]
