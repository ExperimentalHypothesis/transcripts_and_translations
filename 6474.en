Public Program. Bucharest (Romania), 7 September 1993.

I bow to all the seekers of Truth. At the very outset, we have to know that Truth is what it is. We cannot change it and we cannot conceptualize it. It has to be felt, on your central nervous system. As an evolutionary process, whatever we have achieved, we can feel it on our central nervous system. In Sanskrit the word is Bodha. It cannot be understood by mental projections or by reading books. As we know, there are problems and problems in this world today. These problems are caused mostly by human beings. And most of the human problems come from the sick chakras, the centers about which they have told you. If we, somehow, correct those centers, all our physical, mental, emotional and spiritual problems can be solved. 
 

Now whatever I'm telling you today, you do not have to accept Me. But you have to keep your minds open like scientists; and treat my saying as hypothesis, and if it is proved then you have to accept it as honest people. Because you're born in any religion you call yourself belonging to that religion. And whatever our misunderstandings or wrong conceptions which are mental, you start fighting for it. But in every religion it is said that you must get your enlightenment. In every religion it is said that you are to be born again. Despite all that, people are not understanding what's wrong when they follow a particular religion. All these religions now have become either power oriented or money oriented. 

But they are not Spirit oriented. They don't understand that they have to become the Spirit. And that is why we find all over the world there are fights going on in the name of God; in the name of religion. So just by mental understanding, even knowing about other religions, you cannot get rid of this fundamentalism. In the evolutionary process, we have become human beings. But we are not yet perfect, and we do not know the absolute truth. 

Someone says this is the truth, another says this is the truth; another says that is the truth. And mentally believing into these things, they start fighting. But there is a way to know the absolute truth. Our Father, our Creator who has created us, is not going to allow us to destroy his Creation. He has made all beautiful arrangements within us, beautiful machinery within us, by which we can become the Spirit. So the Truth is, you are not this body, [this mind: Mother does say "this mind" twice], this mind or these conditionings and these emotions, ego, but you are a pure Spirit. 

And the second truth is that there is All Pervading Power of Divine Love. You see these beautiful flowers, all over, it's a miracle. From one seed how many beautiful flowers have come out? Who runs our heart? Who runs the whole digestive system? Doctors say its autonomous nervous system. But who is the "auto"? This question we never ask. 

We take everything for granted. Thus, we have forgotten that there must be some power that works it out. Now this All Pervading Power of Divine Love has brought you to this stage of human awareness. And now you have to be the Spirit. You have to have Self Realization. As a result, you know about yourself, you know about your centers, also you know about the center of others, because on your fingertips you can feel the Cool Breeze of the Holy Ghost and you can feel the centers also, yours as well as others. Now if you can cure these centers, then you solve your problem and solve the problem of others. So you become collectively conscious. 

So who is the other? The microcosm becomes the macrocosm. Also, when we see ourselves we live either in the past and in the future. We cannot live in the present. Thoughts come from the past and sometimes from the future and we are jumping on them. In between these thoughts there is the present, which is silence, [which is silence=is repeated in talk, consider 1 instance only] which is peace, which is thoughtless. So you achieve another dimension in your awareness, where you become thoughtlessly aware and you are in the present. Thus peace is established. 

People have very big peace conferences; they get I've seen awards for peace, all kinds of things. But they have no peace within themselves. How can they create peace? How can they talk about peace? 

All this happens when the power of Kundalini about which they have told you, awakens and connects you to this All Pervading Power, and in her journey, she nourishes all the centers, and not only the centers but also absolutely fills you with joy. You feel the Cool Breeze out of your head, coming out, out of the fontanelle bone area. All this is your own. You have the power. It's your own power that works it. 

That's why I call it Sahaja, because it is spontaneous, and Yoga is the union with this Divine power. It is not standing on your head and all kind of physical exercises. As it is, they told me to come after 8 o'clock, and just to give you your Realization. So there is no end to these lectures. I don't know how many thousands of lectures I have given so far. It's just a mental understanding. But something has to happen. Unless and until this happening takes places, actualizes, you will not feel this All Pervading Power. Then you can give Realizations to others, you can cure others, you care cure yourself, I mean, it is a very different life, it's the life of a saint. 

There are so many things that happen that in this short lecture I won't be able to explain everything. But in this hall, see there are so many lights, for which I don't have to tell you all the history of electricity, how it came here. Only there's a switch which has to be put on. Because it is all built-in within you; only thing you have to have faith in yourself. You have to know that you all can get your Self Realization, tonight, here. And of course, after that you have to come to the centers and find out, how you should grow? For this you can't pay. You can't pay for God; because He doesn't understand money, He doesn't understand bank. That is human headache. And also you don't have to pay for attending our centers where you will get all the Divine knowledge free. 
 

Romania, it seems to be a very auspicious and a holy country. Ramana in Sanskrit means "The one enjoyment in the bliss of God". We have at least one thousand very good Sahaja Yogis here, which are very outstandingly great, everywhere in the whole world we have 55 nations; they all respect Romanian Sahaja Yogis. So I am very happy to be with you all here and we'll have now the session for Realization. 

For this I have to just request you to take out your shoes, that's all. This will take hardly 10 to 15 minutes but if you want to leave, you can leave now, but please don't disturb in between. Moreover, I cannot force Sahaja Yoga on you; also we cannot force Self Realization, because I respect your freedom. You also must respect us so that if you do not want to have your Self Realization, please leave the hall. But of course those who want can easily get it. 

You have to have desire to get Self Realization. Now there are three conditions; the first one is that all of you have to have complete faith in yourself, absolute faith in yourself that you all will get your Realization. Please don't have any doubts. The second condition is that you are not to feel guilty for anything; not to feel guilty in any way. If you have done any mistakes in the past, you should have faced it instead of carrying it with you all the time, the guilt. But when you feel guilty you catch on the left hand side of this center here very badly. As a result, you get diseases like angina, spondilitis and lethargic organs. 

So what is the use of feeling guilty? And torturing yourself for nothing at all. The third condition is very simple, [the third condition is], that you have to forgiven everyone. Now, many people say that it is very difficult to forgive. Whether you forgive or don't forgive, you don't do anything. But if you don't forgive, then, you play into wrong hands and torture yourself for nothing at all. So, please forgive, just to say, "I forgive", that's all, "I forgive everyone", you don't think also about those people who have troubled you. On the contrary, just forgive all of them, in general. 

These are the three conditions. I would request everyone to be seated. Those people who are standing there, please be seated, please don't stand. There is seats here, you can sit here. Now, please pay attention this side. They have already told you that there are two powers, two nadis, one is the power of desire, and another is a power of action. So please put your left hand towards Me, like this. Comfortably, very comfortably. Keep it on your lap. You don't have to go to Himalayas, stand on your head. Here you will get your Realization. 

Now, with the right hand, we have to give vibrations or we can say the nourishment, to our different centers. Your both feet should be away from each other, because these are two powers. Not for those who sitting on the ground, they are alright. Alright, first we put our right hand on our heart. Please everyone should do, otherwise please go away Sir. 

Now, in the heart resides the Spirit. If you become the Spirit, you become your own guide, your own master. So please take your right hand, on the upper portion of your abdomen, on the left hand side. This is the center of your mastery. We are working on the left side. This center has been created by great prophets and great masters; we have to just awaken it. Now take your right hand in your lower portion of the abdomen and press it; this is the center of pure knowledge. 

Take your right hand in the corner of your neck and shoulder and turn your head to your right. This is the center I told you about which catches when you are guilty. Now, take your right hand on top of your forehead across, like this and bend your head. This is the center to forgive everyone in general. Now please take your right hand on the backside of your head. And push back your head. This is the center where without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, you have to ask forgiveness from the Divine Power of Love. Now, stretch your hand, palm like this, now this is the last centers, put the center of your palm on your [not transcribed: forehead, because Mother quickly restates] onto your head, onto the fontanelle bone area, which is the soft bone. Now, bend your head. Here, push back your fingers, very important. So that's a good pressure on your scalp. Now move your scalps, slowly, clockwise seven times. Bend your heads, bend your heads. That's all we have to do. 

Now again, please put both your legs away from each other and you have to close your eyes, put the left hand like this and right hand on your heart. Please take out your spectacles because now you have to close your eyes and please don't open them 'til I tell you. Please, now, close your eyes. Here now, you have to ask me a very fundamental question about yourself, three times, you can call me "Mother" or "Shri Mataji". Please ask the question, "Mother, am I the Spirit?" Ask this question three times; three times. I've told you that if you become the Spirit, you become your master, your guide. So take your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. Here you have to ask another question, fundamental question about yourself, "Mother, am I my own master?" ask three times. 

I have told you that I respect your freedom and I cannot force pure divine knowledge on you, you have to ask for it. So please take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen, and press it hard. This is the center where you have to ask for Pure Divine Knowledge. So please ask six times, because this center has got six petals, "Mother, please give me Pure Divine Knowledge". As soon as you ask for Pure Divine Knowledge, the Kundalini starts rising, so we have to nourish the upper centers with our self confidence. So now here, you raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen, on the left hand side. And say with full confidence, ten times, "Mother, I am my own master". I've already told you that you are not this body, this mind, these emotions, this ego, but you are the pure Spirit. 

So now, raise your right hand on your heart and say it twelve times, "Mother, I am the pure Spirit". This All Pervading Divine Power is the ocean of knowledge, ocean of joy, ocean of bliss. But above all, it is the ocean of forgiveness. And whatever wrong we might have done, it can be easily dissolved in the ocean of forgiveness. So please forgive yourself, and put your right hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder, and turn your head to your right. Here, you have to say with full confidence, sixteen times, "Mother, I am not guilty at all". I've already told you, whether you forgive or don't forgive, you don't do anything. But if you don't forgive at this moment, then your center of Agnya will be completely closed, and the Kundalini won't rise, so you will miss your Self Realization. 

So please, forgive everyone in general by putting your hand on top of your forehead across, and bending your head. Please say from your heart, not how many times, "Mother, I forgive everyone in general". Without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, you have to ask forgiveness from the Divine Power just for your satisfaction. So now please take your hand back, on the backside of your head, not the neck, but the head, and put it up, put back your head like that. Now, here you have to say from your heart, not how many times "Oh, Divine Power, please forgive me if I have done any mistakes". 

Now the most important is the seventh center, and for that you have to stretch your palm fully, and put it on the fontanelle bone area, which is a soft bone in your childhood. Now push back your fingers. And bend your head fully. Here again, I cannot force Self Realization on you. You have to ask for it. So move your scalp seven times, clockwise slowly, saying seven times, "Mother, give me my Self Realization". Now please take down your hands and open your eyes please. Now put both the hands towards Me, like this, and don't think. Watch Me, and don't think. 

Now, put the right hand towards Me like this, bend your head, and see with the left hand if there's a Cool Breeze coming out of your fontanelle bone area. Please don't put hand on your head; it could be hot or cold. Now, please put left hand towards me and now bend your head and see for yourself if there is a cool or hot breeze coming out of your head. If there is hot breeze, then please know that you have not forgiven. Some people get it close, and some people get it far away, so now you forgive everyone, again you put the right hand last time, and with the left hand you see. Now please put both your hands towards the sky like this, and your head backwards like this, and here you have to say, out of these three questions, you have to ask one question three times "Mother, is this the Cool Breeze of the Holy Ghost?", or "Mother, is this the All Pervading Power of Divine Love?" or "Mother, is this the Paramchaitanya?", ask any one of these questions three times. It's tremendous.

Now take down your hand, please. All those who have felt cold or hot breeze on their fingertips, or on their hands, or out of their fontanelle bone area, please raise both your hands. 

This is Romania. What to say, you all have got your Realization. Now only thing you must know, what is this? You must know what is this power. You must know how to use it and how to enjoy. Within one month you can become masters. May God Bless you all. I can't meet so many people, I'm sorry, I wish I could but I'm sorry, I can't meet.
