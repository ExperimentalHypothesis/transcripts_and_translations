Diwali Puja. Lake Piru, near Los Angeles, California (USA) 18 November 2001.

It’s a very, very great day today, I should say, where the evil has been suppressed. [big applause]
The evil that spreads its power all over is only because of two factors: one is that you are not knowledgeable; you are still blind, and you follow things which are not right but you think are powerful. This illusion creates not only problems, but absolute destruction.
So we faced a very big challenge, no doubt, and it was easily solved. It was based on all wrong basis just to create a problem. Problem was created with a purpose, and nobody could imagine that it would be solved so easily and so quickly. My desire was to get over it before Diwali – that has happened [big applause].
Due to ignorance also, people do lots of things. Anybody who follows some religion or some sort of a thing, it’s only because they’re not aware of the truth, they’re ignorant about achieving the truth, and they cling on to the fact that they know everything.
With all this happening, there have been so many fractions, so many stupid people, who are getting completely ruined by ignorance. Now when you are coming to Sahaja Yoga, you know all the knowledge – very subtle knowledge – very subtle. It’s not superficial knowledge. It is very subtle. And because they don’t know this subtle knowledge, they fall into the wrong path of, I should say ignorance, and then they try to oppose the people who are doing good.
But, above all, is the power of God. All this drama is played to prove the existence of that great power. It has all worked out so well; and for all of you Sahaja Yogis it’s a very great achievement that you can see the play. Many people who have achieved so-called success cannot see that point, but you can see it because you are spectators. Though all the world is a part and parcel of that drama, you are outside and you can see it so clearly. Whatever has happened, nobody could have believed that would finish before Diwali.
So it goes like this the stupidity, which has been created, and we also sometimes think that this kind of stupid thing will impress others. Impression is not the point. If you see, among all these people who have lost, what impression have they created? They were there to create a great impression on everyone, to show as if they were great warriors and fighters. But what impression they have created? Whether you are a Realised Soul or not, they can see that it’s a miracle. It’s a miracle how things have worked out.
Now, the new phase has started. You all have a very, very open challenge to get people into enlightenment. People are not so ignorant now. They are not so much blasted. Moreover, I find them very much changed. Their attitude towards truth has changed and they understand there is truth beyond all this that they have known. It’s very important because if a human being starts thinking, ‘This is the truth,’ he just gets stuck up! At any cost, whatever may happen, he’ll go on sticking to that. He won’t be able even to verify whether it is the truth or not.
Animals can. How? Because they have got innate capacity to smell the evil – innate. We cannot. Human beings cannot. If there’s an evil man, a dog will bark at him. Otherwise, he’ll go and throw him down. He’ll do everything which is not normally done. How is it he has developed this capacity to find out who is a thief and who is not?
We have a higher awareness. We think about many things which animals cannot think. We understand many things, which animals cannot understand. We cook our food, they don’t. But also sometimes I think we cook our brains! [laughter] Because the way people behave, and try to avoid the truth with their ego is surprising. All this happening is a drama, as I told you, but you better study it properly and apply it to yourself and see if you are also a part and parcel of that drama. For that, you have to rise higher. You have to rise higher – higher above your ego and your superego, your conditioning, and from there to watch yourself and see yourself. ‘What is this? Why am I doing such a thing? Why my attention is like that? What is the main reason for my own ‘possession’ I should say – or my own ‘misunderstandings’? Why do I accept wrong things?’
Once you will start seeing that, and if you find even a wee bit of such nonsensical understanding within you, then you can forgive also people who have been absolutely brainwashed – absolutely brainwashed – and they did everything under that influence. As it is now, you have risen much higher than all these people and much more aware than all of them. So you have to just understand this point and then you can forgive all the mistakes they have committed.
And for the people who are actually bad, you don’t have to worry. That’s the work of the Divine Power to destroy them. But watch yourself and see for yourself – if you have any of such ideas, any lingering idea, if you try to cleanse the mirror so you see your complete image and try – you can – then try to cleanse it. It’s ‘very’ important that you should cleanse yourself.
There are people who have done lots of wrong things—I simply pity them. If they have done wrong things, it is their responsibility to see what they have been doing. Why have they been doing like it? What is the need to do that?
All this introspection will work out so well; then your real powers will come out – your powers of giving Realisation, your powers to understand the problems of your country, of the whole world. And once you feel that ‘you’ are the soldier to fight it out, ‘you’ have the responsibility to fight it out, then things will work out. We cannot leave everything to the Divine Power. You have to use the Divine Power and you have to work it out because you are the soldiers of Divine Power.
Of course, with that beautiful idea, we start cleansing ourselves. You need not know everything, as to what things are happening and how they are happening, how they are working out. That’s not your work. You are a soldier, so you have to just fight; fight the ignorance – your own and of others. Because mostly soldiers fail when they have their egos. When they fail, they have other obstacles in their minds. There should be no obstacle, but you should just push forward and know there’s no obstacle at all. It’s just a myth that there are some obstacles and that you cannot do it.
It’s not easy to raise the awareness of people; because looks [like] there’s a very little of distance of crossing over—but it’s not so. It’s not. It is a ‘very’ difficult task sometimes for some people to get out of the bandhans of Agnya. At that point, I find some of you fail. And for that, is best thing is to introspect. When you think you are always correct, and you are alright, the best is to introspect: “Am I doing everything right or wrong? How am I working for my betterment?” The illusion is such that sometimes you think you are doing very well.
Say, in our Sahaja Yoga, some people are very forward type; they’ll come forward, they’ll do this, do that. But inside, what is the purpose? The purpose is that people should see that you are doing this work, that work. The purpose should be that you should be able to see ‘yourself’ within. You must see what is the problem inside and you can very well understand that you have been of great help to yourself and to others.
For example, there’s a very big building and all the buildings in the nearby area may fall down due to earthquake, but this one building which will be standing erect. The reason is that that building is constructed on very solid grounds. In the same way, if Sahaja Yoga is constructed on a very sound wall, nobody can destroy it, nobody can distort it. And every person has to do that.
For example, some people told Me, “Your Sahaja Yogis, you know, are like this, and they are big show-offs.” I said, “Really? I can’t believe it that they could be like that.” I said, “I would like to meet them, whosoever they are.” So they said, “No, You can find them out Yourself, who are those people and why they behave like that.” I said, “Myself, I know everything, but I want ‘you’ to know everything.” Finding faults with others is a very nice thing, very easy also—but find out faults within yourself! What are these things that are straggling us? This is the best way of improving your awareness. Like you are going in the car and you have to know the road. You have to know how you are driving. You have to see what are the problems; but instead of, you think no end of yourself! It won’t work out.
Today is a day of very great happening, I should say; celebrating the Diwali is a very, very joyous thing. But this joy, it’s not for ourselves – this joy is for the whole world. We have to ‘work’ for the whole world. We work for ourselves, for our jobs, for our money, whatever it is, but what are you doing for others? That you should see for yourself. There are very important, only such people are useful in Sahaja Yoga because they have concern, they have care and they are doing something for others. It’s a great enjoyment with that.
When the lights are burning, it’s to give you happiness. They are burning their bodies to give you happiness. They are the ones who should teach us that we have to do something ourselves to enjoy our own higher awareness.
All this will work out, I’m sure. I am also trying My best to make this light unshaky and full of enthusiasm. It’s there. It is you who are anxious to fill your pitchers. You ‘can’ do it. It’s not My anxiety that’s going to help you. So even if you want to have complete picture about yourself, you have to first give up identification with yourself, otherwise you’ll never know what’s wrong with you. If you are too much identified with you, you cannot come up.
Now, as it is, what is the aim, after all? What is the aim of our lives? We have to change the whole world into a peaceful theme. Changing yourself, of course, is a great thing, no doubt; but changing others also will stop all the problems of the world. If all the people of this world become good people, Sahaja Yogis, then can you imagine what will happen? Think of that dream that I have that we have to change each and every person that we can change, and we have to transform them into good people. If they are not transformed, they are like a candle without any flame in it. And if they ‘are’ capable of getting transformed, we should try all methods, all the tricks to do that.
I’m sure very soon such a day will come when you will say, “Mother, now we are very safe.” Don’t think of the past and the problems of the past. You have now overcome it. Just enjoy yourself. And have faith in yourself and work it out. I am sure very soon it will happen. Very quickly it will happen. It is your desire, also your method of working it out, your anxiety to work it out. Main anxiety should be “How can I transform this person?” You can transform anyone.
You know, you tell one person, another person follows it. Like when we came with the plane, I found at the airport so many people had put up their hands towards Me like this. I said, “Who are these people?” They were not Sahaja Yogis. They had seen somebody—or what had happened I couldn’t ask them—,but all them said, “We are feeling the cool breeze in the hand.” They didn’t know anything about it. They didn’t know about Kundalini, nothing. Then what is this cool coming? That basically they are there to get their Realisation, only we have to extend our ideas. We have to extend our ‘love’ to them.
Instead of getting annoyed with them, better is to give them a chance and you’ll be amazed that they are very anxious to get transformed. They’re all fed up with all the artificial things they’re having. It’s over now. You will be amazed how many are waiting there for you to give them Self-Realisation and let them celebrate their Diwali with you.
Enjoy Diwali. Diwali you cannot celebrate with one candle. You have to have more and more of candles. And that’s what is your job. Only by your own candle, you are going to do it. It’s your own and it can enlighten anyone. Then why not use it—at any cost, at any place?
I have met some Sahaja Yogis. I asked them, “What did you do?” They said, “No, nothing.” “Nothing? You did nothing?” “No, nothing”. Then, what’s the use of getting Realisation? If you have done nothing, you don’t want to give Realisation to anyone, don’t want to talk to anyone, you feel so shy about it?
Then I met some who said, “Just now Mother, we are coming from a programme.” “How are you so late?” “Because they told us there’s a bomb scare.” “So you were waiting outside?” “Yes.” “How many?” “All of us. Thousands were waiting. There was no bomb. They said there’s no bomb. So we went inside and we all got Realisation.” “But you were realised souls?” “No, we had our Realisation, that sometimes we have to wait also, and now we are convinced that nobody can harm us, nobody can trouble us, overpower us. Only we do it to ourselves.”
So again I will say introspection is very, very important in Sahaja Yoga. When the light inside is there, you have to look after it.
I was extremely happy to hear from many people that they felt the blessings of Diwali. But, you see, yesterday, you had these showers (of shooting stars)—how timely they were! It never happened—in the history of this world it never happened. Why yesterday these showers came in and tried to give a new experience of the showers? All this is a time, we should say, that even the nature knows, and we should also know, that this is the time for a special thing.
Normally I get letters about people who are sick and their parents are sick or their... this is sick, all kinds of things. Then somebody’s marriage is broken. Then somebody has children, they are sick…—I mean all kind nonsensical problems they do it. The reason is they themselves, those who write, are not realised souls, or maybe they are half way, because they could themselves say that: “Why should we write to Mother? We can get it done ourselves!” Instead of that, one has to write what they have achieved, how they have achieved very much, how they have got love from others, how they have worked out Sahaja Yoga in small villages. All this is much better to write than to write: “My mother is sick, my father is sick.” All these relationships, they go on killing you.
So no more is your brother. Nobody is your sister. Only Sahaja Yogis are your brothers and sisters. Now you have some cousin and it’s cousin’s cousin and… So let it be. That’s not your job. You don’t have to work it out. Even before coming, I got letters like that. Somebody cousin’s cousin’s... this thing. So I asked this lady, I said, “Why do you write all these things all the time about this cousin and that cousin?” She says, “Mother, I am trying to spread Sahaja Yoga.” “How?” “Because if they’ll be cured, then they will come to Sahaja Yoga.” This is not they way we want to spread Sahaja Yoga. This looks like advertising or something, speciality that you should cure somebody, then some people will come to Sahaja Yoga. We just don’t want such people to come.
I don’t want to hurt, but I want to give you courage and understanding and the wisdom. What, why are we Sahaja Yogis here? Just to cure all the relations of ours? They may be sick because of some mistakes they have committed.
Instead of paying attention to all these such people, you should pay attention to yourself and to your ascent. You have to respect yourself. If you are their relation, it’s none of your business. Like understanding, wisdom, that we have come here for a very, very special work, of very high quality. If that is not there, then all such people write to Me.
Now one lady got married in Sahaja Yoga and she wrote to Me that “I was divorced about eight months back or nine months back, whatever it is. And now my relations are now saying, “Why did you marry in Sahaja Yoga?” And everybody is criticising me and Sahaja Yoga.” I said, “Who asked her to marry?” I never asked her. So the marriage has become the main point for her, that “All my family people are saying…” What did they do for Sahaja Yoga? “If this marriage doesn’t become all right, then they will say there’s something wrong with Sahaja Yoga.” Let them say. We have not committed that way.
Every time I have told you that “Don’t write to Me for your mother, father, this, that.” If you don’t know how to cure them, better give up Sahaja Yoga. You yourself can cure them. You can work it out yourself.
But if you see it, so many letters every day for Me. I asked them, “Is your father in Sahaja Yoga?” “No.” “Mother?” “No.” “Brother?” “No. Nobody.” “So why are you asking Me? What relationship I have with them? They’re not Sahaja Yogis. I am only responsible for Sahaja Yogis. They are not Sahaja Yogis, so why do you want to trouble Me?” It is impossible to understand.
In Sahaja Yoga, you are supposed to get Self-Realisation, all right. Then those who ‘want’ to have Self-Realisation, you can give them, and fix them properly.
But instead of that somebody who is hanging in the air and who is following from the airport to some other place, all kinds of things—all this is really maddening and is sickening. I’m not concerned. You should not be concerned also. What you should do is to see that these people who are talking about it, should come to Sahaja Yoga. And you must tell them “Because you are not doing Sahaja Yoga, that’s why it is like that.” Or “That person is not doing Sahaja Yoga, that’s where the problem is. We are all right. We are happy.” Because Sahaja Yoga is an open thing, so everybody comes there.
I would request you all on Diwali day to promise to yourself: “I will not waste my energy on people who are not Sahaja Yogis.” It’s ‘very’ important, because all the time the attention is on wrong thing, and on wrong basis. If you have some intelligence, you must know that now you belong to a very high quality spiritual people, which are very few. In this world, there are ‘very’ few, and you must make a concentrated effort to see that this quality must be in so many people and there must be lots of aspiration about it.
Find out such people. Tell them you have found it, “You can also get it”. But don’t worry about things which are of no value to us. You must know you are a special race. You are special soldiers who have been trained for doing Sahaj work. So wasting energy on your relations and brothers and sisters is no good for you. It is to be understood now that you have your own energy reserved—for what? For Sahaja Yogis.
You should help everyone who is a Sahaja Yogi or who wants to become a Sahaja Yogi. Who are established Sahaja Yogis, you must help them; because we are one personality and these are all the different hands of one personality, one God.
So this oneness must be established within yourself and also others should see that oneness in you.
There are some people who are very active. There are some people who are very active in criticising. All that will work out I’m sure, because this is the year of great achievements and great success; but with that, if you start doing something nonsensical – nothing will work out.
Of course, I don’t say that we haven’t got such Sahaja Yogis with us. We have. We have all the soldiers with us, no doubt. All the armament they have, everything they have, but we need more. And for that, we have to work out collectively, must plan what should we do.
Recently there has been a big argument about the Islamic behaviour of people. We are neither Christians nor Islamic nor anything. We are not – because you cannot put yourself into a small arena, saying “I am a Sahaja Yogi, but I am a Christian.” You cannot. You have to give up that margin. You are a Sahaja Yogi out-and-out and all the other nonsensical things are not belonging to you.
I have seen many Muslims also come to Sahaja Yoga, but out of them very few are real Sahaja Yogis. But they’ll come, listen to My lecture, this, that. But very few are really Sahaja Yogis in the real sense of the word. Then you will start seeing the defects of your community, of so-called religion you belong to, whatever it is, you will see. And you will definitely try to correct it if you love them—or you give up. These are special people, specially selected for a very special cause and you cannot waste your energy on small, nonsensical things. That is one thing you should know.
On this Diwali day you have to know that you have to burn yourself from the light of the Divine to absolutely spread all over. But don’t do it too much. Like some people came and told Me, “Mother, we have given up our parents. We have given up this. We have given up that. Still we are not good.” So I said, “Why should you give up? You are catching onto something, then you are giving up, or automatically it is just finished?” “Ah, we were, You see, very much attached to our family, parents, country, this, that and now we have given up some—but some.”
Such half-baked people are no good. And don’t pay too much attention to them. They don’t deserve any attention: that is very much to be understood, that you should not be also like that, nor you should have friends like that, nor you should make them Sahaja Yogis. Sahaja Yogi is a special character of a soldier who fights for the truth. That kind of a personality, when you will have, there will be lights all over.
This Diwali day, I bless you all from My heart and I want you to respect yourself and understand what is the position of your being in this ‘organisation’, we can call, or in this ‘movement’ of Sahaja Yoga. And how are we working it out. The attention should move from all this nonsensical, mundane things to your Self. It should be a very dynamic force that should work out. And I’m sure next year it will be very different. We’ll have all the beautiful blessings of the Divine. We must do it collectively, understandingly.

May God bless you!
