耶誕崇拜

印度格納帕提普蕾1998年12月25日‧

我首先以英語講話,跟著才用印地語。

很久以前的今天,耶穌基督出生。你們都知道祂出生的故事,以及祂經歷的各種折磨。

祂是那位作為霎哈嘉瑜伽模範的人。因為祂不為自己而活,完全沒有,祂為別人而活,以開啟額輪。你可能很神聖,可能很有力量,但這個世界是那麼殘酷,他們不理解靈性,他們不明白靈性的偉大。還有,有很多原因靈性被攻擊,他們常常都這樣做。每一位聖人都曾經受過很多苦。但我想基督是受苦最多的一位。如你所知,基督被賦予神聖格涅沙的所有力量,因為祂是神聖格涅沙的化身。首先是祂的純真,我們可以說祂是永恆的孩童。祂不能理解這個愚蠢世界的殘酷和偽善。就算你明白這事實,你又可以做些什麼呢?但基督卻以極大的勇氣,在一個人們對靈性沒有概念的國家出生。

我曾經閱讀過一本有關祂的書籍,說祂來到喀什米爾(Kashmir),遇見我的一位先祖—薩利瓦漢拿王(Shalivahana)。那是非常有趣的,因為全用梵文寫成,作者或許不大懂梵文,但他卻全用梵文。我可以肯定,對西方人來說,這並不太合適。感謝神,他不懂梵文,否則這將是非常危險的。書中有一段是這樣寫的,他問耶穌基督..「為甚麼你來印度?」祂回答..「這是我的國家,這就是我來到這個國家的原因。在這裡,人們尊重靈性。但我卻與那些完全不懂靈性的人住在一起。」他們的對話是非常非常有趣的。因為薩利瓦漢拿王說..「有更多理由你要回到你的國家,教導他們純潔無邪的原理(Nirmala Tatwam)。」這是淨化的原則。祂回去,三年半後,就被釘上十字架。

我個人認為,西方和印度的死刑最大的分別是這樣的,在西方,殺戮人是一種偉大的專業,以很瑣碎細微的藉口,他們殺害人。任何人若是聖人,他們都殺害,他們稱他是一位行為鹵莽者。這是逃避靈性的最佳途徑。在印度,若這是聖人說的,永遠都不會被挑戰。他們相信他,因為他是聖人,因為他的品格比我們高得多。雖然有些令人厭惡的人在折磨聖人,但整體上,大家都尊重他們。任何假導師,通常都不會留在這個國家,因為他們知道會被揭露。還有,他們是那麼金錢取向,所以他們走到美國,或其他國家,安頓下來,賺取金錢。這是我們必須看清的其中一個徵兆,這也許是耶穌基督為甚麼在一個非常非常平庸的家庭出生。就算是在孩童時,他也沒有妥當的睡床。他睡在那裡,他的父母親住在一處有牛及有動物居住的地方,這些全都有用文字來描述。那是顯示屬靈不需要任何奢侈,也並不需要任何排場和炫耀。

那是內在的力量,內在的光輝,內在的光芒自動顯現,你不需要做任何事情來炫耀它。這一類人對金錢沒有意識,對其他事物沒有佔有的概念。他只關心身體上受苦的人,甚至是痲瘋病人,他也想把他們治好,他想去幫助許多許多染病的人。因為在那時候,沒有醫院,沒有醫生,所以他的注意力都放在身體受折磨的人身上,他也在思維上為他們作好準備。在山上有那麼多漂亮的講道。那時候,人們不是那麼物質主義,所以他們都聆聽他,但你卻說不準有多少人明白他。若你不是一位已得自覺的靈,要明白靈性是非常困難的。那位談論靈性的人和那位聆聽者,兩者最基本也是要得到自覺。

從基督美麗的一生我看到,我們必須學習,除非我們是已得自覺的靈,我們仍然會折磨基督的靈魂。我們也曾經見到,這樣的事情正在發生。那些談及基督的人,祂很清楚的說..「你會稱呼我為『基督,基督』,我將不會承認你。」祂非常清楚的這樣說過。我不知道他們為甚麼不把這句話從聖經中刪除。意思是那些以神的名說話,傳道和好好打扮以炫耀自己是屬靈的人,基督將不會承認他們,就是這樣簡單。在現在最後審判的時候,祂將以靈性來評價整個世界,即以生命能量。祂的審判已經開始,我已經看到。你可以看到在那麼多的國家裡,事情正在消失。所有他們的自我,他們的侵略性,他們的殘酷,都被挑戰。那些在戰爭中犯錯的人,會被批判。所以在歷史中,那些對社區,對人民犯錯的人,他們全都會被批判。他們不能作出侵略的行為以及不能再折磨人。這就是神聖格涅沙原則怎樣藉由霎哈嘉瑜伽起作用。

基督沒有這樣說,但祂卻有說..「將會有最後的審判。」一方面,祂是非常仁慈和慈悲,另一方面,祂卻是真正的錫呂‧格涅沙,因為祂拿起武器,打擊在廟宇裡兜售的人。你不能以宗教的名義來做生意。這是怎樣一件需要明白的大事。但基督徒並沒有遵從,他們沒有。我不知道他們何去何從?我們有聖雄甘地(Mahatma Gandhi),他常常談論靈性,只談論靈性。但他的繼任人卻把他與他的靈性放在一邊,開展一個的新世界,新的念頭以及新的生活方式。那些應該是甘地的追隨者現在卻想擁有很多的酒吧,擁有各式各樣的物質,你可以想像嗎?這個國會是由聖雄甘地開展,但國會卻在做著這些事情,他們怎可以作出領導?

這個國家最美好最珍貴的就是靈性。除了靈性外,他們可以往何處去?他們可能不是基督徒,但他們尊重基督,他們尊重聖經。我必須告訴你這是事實,人們就是不知道。他們不是基督徒的意思是他們還未受洗,但他們卻尊重基督。因為他們知道基督是那麼有靈性—祂是靈性的化身,這就是印度人可愛之處。無論是印度教徒或穆斯林,對他們來說是完全沒有分別。在印度,有很多穆斯林是聖人和蘇菲派(Sufis),他們得到所有人的尊重,無論他們是否穆斯林或印度教徒。

所以對於基督,完全沒有人會反對。相反,你們看到昨天他們是怎樣因基督而那麼高與,因為他們都是已得自覺的靈。就算他們不是,在這個國家,基督也很受尊重。他們不明白,他們怎能細察基督的一生?他們怎能評價基督?他們又怎能製作有關基督的庸俗電影?這是他們不能忍受的,因為他們內在對靈性的尊重比外在多得多。以基督之名,人們已經做了太多的錯事,殺害了太多人,各種各樣的錯事都被接受。作出這些行為後,人們不明白他們怎能評價基督。

例如,我所知道的英國,我對看到的感到非常驚訝。若有任何人去世,他們喝酒,任何人出生,他們也喝酒。只有喝酒他們才能有關連。「你們怎可以喝酒?」我問他們。他們說..「為什麼不能?基督創造酒精。」我說..「什麼時候?」「在一個婚宴裡。」我說..「在婚宴裡?那不是酒,而是他們在那裡種植的葡萄的葡萄汁。我們的語言稱它為drakshas。這怎會是酒呢?」酒必須先發酵,必須腐壞,怎會這樣?所以喝酒是一出最大的戲劇。

在印度我們知道,雖然沒有人說什麼反對喝酒,但我們知道喝酒是一種犯罪的行為。你看到每一天,每一個人都知道,若你喝酒,你會變得完全失去理性。在宗教的平臺上,沒有甚麼可以說。每一個人都知道喝酒是怎麼樣的。在海外的人不是不知道,他們也知道。但不知何故,喝酒成了潮流。甚至在我的國家,也開始推介喝酒。我不知道為甚麼在獨立後,人們開始喝酒。在每一個派對,他們喝酒,在聖誕日,以基督之名,他們也喝酒。這是對基督美麗、神聖的人生的一種侮辱。

所以,當他們來到這個地球,或許他們所有神聖的力量都已經被摧毀。印度人最好的地方是至少他們尊重,他們尊重神聖的地方,這是他們的長處。他們知道甚麼是神聖。當然,現在他們變得既現代化也美國化,但他們仍然知道甚麼是錯,甚麼不該做。因著霎哈嘉瑜伽,我非常高興的說..「外國的霎哈嘉瑜伽士也變得非常美麗。」我很驚訝,因為在他們的文化裡,是沒有靈性的。我不知道他們怎能離開那些荒謬的事物而像蓮花一樣,漂亮地冒起,以靈性的漂亮香氣出現。這是奇跡。每一個人都說..「母親,我們不能相信,這是怎樣發生的?你是怎樣應付過來的?」我可以說這是基督的祝福。他們看到人們怎樣以基督之名和以很低下的方式來成就事情,因此他們發展了某種認知,知道必定有某些不妥之處,這不是基督,他們描述的不是祂神聖的人生,是別的東西。這就是我想為甚麼在西方,有更迫切,更大的升進力量。

昨天有人來告訴我..「母親,沒有集體靜坐。」我聽了很高興。在霎哈嘉瑜伽最重要的是靜坐,毫無疑問的。但外國人做靜坐比印度人多得多,令人很驚訝。以靈性來說,外國的男女都裝備完善,特別是俄國人。我很驚訝在美國,他們告訴我..「母親,這些美國人不是霎哈嘉瑜伽士。」我說..「為甚麼?」他們沒有那種對我的尊重,他們沒有靜坐。沒有靜坐的人不是霎哈嘉瑜伽士。」我說..「我同意。」他們令所有美國人靜坐。我不知道為甚麼東盟國家的人,如保加利亞人,俄羅斯以及所有羅馬尼亞人,他們怎能那麼喜歡霎哈嘉瑜伽。當然,他們有共產主義的詛咒,或許他們因此感到自己的人生有某些缺失,所以必需深入自己,這就是為甚麼他們可以成就到。我必須告訴印度人,你們必須靜坐。印度人有一或二種壞品質,其一是聯群結黨。例如,若他們是婆羅門,他們會坐在一起,若他們是Kayasthas,他們會坐在一起,若他們是Bhaniyas,他們會坐在一起。若不是這些,他們會以另一種名義聯合一起。這是我的國家最差的詛咒。因為當你們聯群結党,你永遠看不到別人的優點,亦看不到自己的缺點,這種聯群結黨為這個國家帶來很多問題。

在基督的年代,有不同種類的人。一是喜歡靈性,一是不喜歡。現在我們這裡有些人喜歡靈性,但他們的一隻腳仍然在水中。這個老問題仍然存在。這會把我們的國家摧毀。我們不能結合在一起,我們不能成為朋友。當然不是在霎哈嘉瑜伽,我必須要說,這問題已經好好的解決了。若你看看就算在基督的年代,祂與祂的門徒也有問題。特別是某些與彼得有關的事情,他就是那位說撒旦將會遇見你的人。我想人們已經跌入撒旦的力量中。他說他把很多人的撒旦惡魔清除,放進豬裡面。這是事實,撒旦的力量正強而有力地運作。我們越發展對靈性的安全感,它們便越發展得好。撒旦的力量在西方和在東方是以不同的形相出現。我想告訴你們怎樣小心地去找出在西方的撒旦力量。

你未必受到它影響,因為你是已得自覺的靈,但你必須對抗它。例如種族主義,種族主義仍然非常強大,非常非常之強大。你必須藉由與另一種族的人通婚以對抗種族主義。但我仍對一個黑人與一個白人配婚感到困難,那是沒有可能的境況。若我真的嘗試這樣做,我也不知道甚麼事情會發生。

我必須告訴你,我們曾經有過這樣的婚姻。一個白種的法國女士與一個黑人配婚。不是那個法國女士好支配人,而是那個黑人。所以我很驚訝,你知道嗎,怎會這樣的?所以我想原因是他想報復,或許是暫時的。首先巨大的愛心和情感必須在人們之間滋長。這種顏色是那麼深入皮膚裡,與內在的愛毫無關係,是那麼深入皮膚。感謝天,在我的國家,你可以有膚色很黑的妻子,而丈夫的膚色可以很淺,或是相反的情況。他們從不以這個角度來看事情,我想在這個國家,這種情況並不存在。

但我們有另一種情況出現,你看,這是一種典型的人類問題,就是來自自我的歧視。我必須要說,基督曾經嘗試對抗你們的自我。祂在一個非常謙卑的家庭出生,祂並非一位白色膚色的人,不是。以你們的語言,祂的皮膚是褐色的,但以印度語來說,他是黑皮膚的。但當說到靈性,你只看到開悟的那一位,你看不到他們擁有甚麼的顏色,甚麼膚色。那是非常、非常的表面的。我視這為西式生活必須征服的其中一個敵人,物質主義是另一個。我視反對基督最差勁要算是不道德。不道德卻廣受西方社會接受,各式各樣的不道德行為都被接受。就如他們所說,所有不道德的人若把選票投向某人,他就成為美國總統。好吧,沒有甚麼關係了,容許各種不道德行為,這是絕對違反基督的。人們不明白不道德會帶領他們到達我也不知道該怎樣稱呼的國度,因為那裡甚至比畜性的國度還要差。他們是那麼不道德,他們聆聽如佛洛依德那樣的人的說話,就像他們是沒有腦袋,沒有靈魂,去注意這樣的人。只有來到霎哈嘉瑜伽之後,你才可以擁有像基督那樣模範的人生。無論是甚麼,都已經過去、結束和完蛋了。

今天你是已得自覺的靈,道德是你的力量。忘記過去吧。我可以肯定,若你過著非常、非常道德的生活,你可以令很多很多人來到霎哈嘉瑜伽的旗幟之下。同樣,另一個非常差勁的敵人是憤怒。他們很自豪,他們會說..「我現在很憤怒,你知道嗎,我是非常憤怒。」他們不會因此感到羞愧,仍繼續說..「我非常憤怒。」好像說「我很憤怒」是沒有錯的。他們說..「我憎恨你。」我的意思是你可以想像任何印度的語言,若他們用憎恨這個字,代表我正在犯罪。所有這種侵略性是來自憤怒。若某人想發怒,他應該對自己發怒,最好還是擺脫憤怒。你可以拉扯你的頭髮,你可以咬你自己,你可以用枕頭打自己,這些可能都是最佳去除憤怒的途徑。看看自己為甚麼憤怒?有時是絕對毫無用處的,有時是沒有意義的,有時是絕對瘋狂、愚蠢的。但直至你停止說..「我非常憤怒。」就是這樣,就是這個時候你才意識到你正在完全的下跌。

基督並沒有談及所有精微的東西,我卻曾經向你談及,因為是留給我說的。沒有得到自覺,你又怎能談論精微的東西?你不能。

上次我告訴你有關生命生量,那是甚麼,那象徵甚麼以及你可以怎樣得到我們稱為Tanmatra的精微能量。光元素—Tejas,水元素—Jala,以及火元素—Prithvi。但我卻沒有告訴你一個非常特別的元素,以英語來說,你們稱它為乙太(ether)。乙太是被另一種Tanmatra所管理的元素,我們稱它為Akash,特別在今天,因為是基督犧牲了祂的生命,開啟了我們的額輪,令我們到達了Akash這個狀態。沒有祂是不可能達至的。我們可以如常溝通,像我們可以與別人交談,我們可以說話,我們也可以用手指來表達自己,用手去溝通,但若要與生命能量溝通,你必須擁有生命能量,否則你不能感覺另一個人。若你處於額輪,代表你在思維層次,絕對的思維層次,那麼你的生命能量也在縮小,意思是你不知道他們真正在說甚麼。你沒有能力評價你的生命能量,因為這些生命能量是在思維層面。

他們說..「母親,我們問過生命能量。」我說..「真的嗎?」若你沒有生命能量,你又怎能詢問生命能量呢?這是非常普通的事情,我們詢問生命能量,我們想從生命能量找出答案,那是不可能的。因為你只在思維層面。基督所做的是把你帶離思維層面,那是最困難的。我感到很驚訝,那些跟隨基督教的人卻是處於最差的思維層次。他們絕對是處於思維層次。他們就像......我不知道該怎樣稱呼他們。就像德里的霧一樣,你不能橫越它。這是基督打破的。我們向祂該負多少責任,祂清除了人類升進的最大障礙,就是打破了這個額輪,這個在我們內裡的思維存有(mental being)。我們像瘋子一樣閱讀,像瘋子一樣聆聽別人,我們喜歡那些餵食我們思維存有的人。他們是那麼多思緒,那麼好爭辯,不停的只想及自己的聰明才智。那麼,你只需要說..「好吧,跪拜吧。」你不能與他們充滿思維的行為對抗。那就是為甚麼很思維取向的人需要敬拜基督。

這種思維上的謬誤令人感到自己高人一等。「啊!無論我們做了些什麼,有什麼錯呢?」他們不能糾正自己。因為除非你超越這個思維上的界線,你看不到自己,你不能內省,你看不到自己,你卻看到其他人,「這些霎哈嘉瑜伽士是這樣的,霎哈嘉瑜伽是這樣的。」以及各種類似的事情,但你看不到自己,因為所有事情都是那麼思維取向。這種思維取向必須藉由耶穌基督的幫助而得到完全的約束。祂在你腦海裡也是思維,基督也是思維的,現在該怎樣做?那個要打破人們思維取向的人也是思維,你令祂成為思維,就像一座石像。

所以,首先我們要告訴自己,不要想,不要想,不要想,不要想,四次。跟著你可以升上,這是非常重要的。在靜坐中,你必須超越思維。感謝基督,祂是坐在額輪上,去完成這荒謬的思想存有。

我想人們或許必須停止閱讀。就算是我的講座,也變成思緒,該怎樣做?我的意思是任何東西一進入他們腦袋,不知何故,都變成了思緒。跟著他們向我發問..「母親,你是否這樣說?你有沒有...。」我說..「我這樣說是要令你無思無慮,只想嚇倒你,不是要你坐下來分析,不是這樣。我這樣說後,你變得絕對的震驚和被嚇倒。」所以對你們全部人來說,最好是變得無思無慮,這是基督的祝福,這是祂為你們完成的。我可以肯定,若你能成就到,不要把注意力放在別人身上,不要作出反應,只是不要有反應。他們對看到的任何事物,都作出反應。有甚麼需要這樣呢?這樣做有甚麼用呢?你想對這種反應做些什麼呢?這種反應什麼也不是,只能在你腦海裡製造了思潮上的漣漪?我已經告訴了你數百萬次,在這個崇拜之後,你必須變得無思無慮。

若這樣的情況發生,我視我們已經成就了很多。這是基督賜予我們的最大的祝福,你必須真的很享受這祝福。只有在你內在的Akash Tatwa在工作,它是怎樣運作的?藉由你的注意力,你們都知道,它是與我一起工作。我以我的注意力成就了很多事情。是怎樣成就的?只要我的注意力變得無思無慮,只要無思無慮,它自然成就到。但若你常常把注意力放在思緒上,不停的思考,它便不會做它應該要做的工作。只要你是無思無慮,你的注意力便能成就非凡的事情,否則便不能。

所以必須從你自己那處升起,跟著從別人處升至謙虛這更高層次。在那裡,你與天空溝通,我們可以稱它為Tanmatra,或是本質,或是乙太的精華。乙太令我們可以擁有電視,擁有電話,否則,這將會是奇跡。但以這個Tanmatra,只要坐下,你便可以做這工作,它在運作,只用注意力運作,我是知道的,你亦知道。你不需要請求我把注意放在某處,你只要放注意力,它自會起作用。這是你得到非常重要的東西,我視這是你沒有不妥當首先取得的東西。你們開始從土元素顯現,跟著是火元素,再跟著是Jala(水)元素,跟著我們來到Tejas(光),我們的臉孔變得閃亮。最後,我們處於無思慮的知覺狀態,藉此我們的注意力變得絕對的自由去做一些特別的工作。但若你仍然不停的思考,注意力便被迫要忙碌,你知道,非常忙碌,你不需要問我..「母親,請放注意力。」你也可以放注意力,你自己也可以成就到。

在這注意力下,你不感到你得到甚麼,你立足在何處,你穿著些甚麼,其他人在做著些甚麼,不,甚麼也不是。你與自己合而為一。這是一個充滿幽默的人生。那麼多幽默,那麼多喜樂,那麼多快樂,你不再關心所有一般人關心的事情。

現在,霎哈嘉瑜伽在那麼多國家中有成就。我因你們而感到自豪,非常自豪。現在霎哈嘉瑜伽也到達非洲的國家。對我來說,這是極大的滿足。你們全部也可以做到,你們也可以成就到。唯一要做的只是變成無思無慮的知覺狀態,就如基督的祝福的一樣。若它成就到,你會絕對的享受自己。

願神祝福你們。

Translation from Hindi:

The fact is that this English language has been imposed on us for the past three hundred years. I have never studied the English language. Never! Even in school there was a small book, and in the Medical College, no one taught English as a language. My father used to say, “It is such an easy language and there are so few words in it, that there is no need to study it.” And he admitted us into a Marathi medium school. And he used to advise us, “Learn Marathi and Sanskrit language”. So I did not study Sanskrit language and as for Hindi, I never ever studied Hindi language. No question about that! Didn’t learn in school or in college Didn’t learn hindi language anywhere! But there is one good quality in Me, which I must tell you about, that whenever I speak in Hindi, I can speak only in Hindi; and when I speak Marathi I can speak only in Marathi language, and when I speak in English, I can speak only English. It is very difficult for Me to translate from one to the other. That is why I cannot mix them up.

Each of these three languages is different from the others. Now no one will believe that I have not studied Hindi language. But because of My interest in reading, interest in reading good Hindi books, I learnt the Hindi language. But in the beginning My Hindi speaking had a lot of words and influence from Sanskrit. Because Maharastrians speak like that only. They don’t know day-to-day Hindi language. When they speak Hindi more than half of the words will be Sanskrit and the rest will be Marathi. You understand? This is the condition.

What I have understood from all this is, that even language comes as a gift of God. Like you have a gift in music and arts, in the same way, aptitude for languages is also a blessing. And by that, one can master many languages. But the Hindi speaking people cannot learn any other language. The reason for this is – for example the English people also, they cannot learn any other language. And even if they learn it, they will not be fluent. The reason is that everyone can speak English, so there is no interest for them in learning any other language. Now the Hindi speaking people have this problem that they just cannot speak any other language.

I will never insist that you must learn Marathi, because Marathi language is very complicated. It’s very difficult. Only Maharashtrians can understand it. And it has so much merriment and so many jokes. There is nothing indecent in that language. There is not even a bit of filth or indecency in it. It is such a profound and expressive language that for Sahaja Yoga there is no other language that is more appropriate than Marathi. Because only in Marathi a description of  Kundalini was written. Whatever has been written by saints and sages, has been written in Marathi language. And if you learn Marathi, you can learn any other language. There is no doubt in this. But Maharashtrians will not learn any other language. They are very obstinate.

I asked someone, “Just read this Hindi book”. He read a little bit, and put it down. I asked him: “Why?” and he said, “It is full of rubbish! Only nonsense is written, I don’t want to read it!” Because Marathi is such a clean language with such pure thoughts, that after reading... After reading Gita, you cannot read wayside books of dirt and filth. You will not understand them! So if some of you start learning Marathi, it will be a good thing. But it is a very difficult language to master. There are a lot of synonyms in Marathi language.

The reason I am telling you this today is that even after coming to Maharashtra I have to speak in Hindi, because you do not understand Marathi. In Pune I speak in Marathi only. But in Mumbai I have to speak in Hindi. So those who like to learn languages, should learn Marathi. It is a language to learn. And it is such a wonderful language that our Namdeva who was a saint, a very big, a very great saint, was called by Guru Nanak and told to learn Punjabi language and write his poetry in Punjabi. And Namdevji wrote such a thick book, in Punjabi language.

I too was able to speak in Punjabi when I lived in Punjab. If you can learn Marathi, then, except Tamil language, you can learn any other language. Maybe you will be able to learn a few Tamil words It’s such a  situation, that in this country there are fourteen official languages – we have, you will be surprised, fourteen official languages in this country. So I will say this that if you learn Marathi, you will manage to learn at least 8-9 of these fourteen languages. Now one more thing which is wonderful!

The Bible has been translated, directly from Hebrew language directly in purity, in Marathi language. In this area, there was a lady called Rama Devi, very intelligent and noble. All the writings in the Bible, she made a translation of them – of all the Bible writings – and she did it in Marathi language. In that she has used Marathi names, like for John she has used the name Yohan, and for Matthews she has used Matthai. So the Bible that I have read was in Marathi, and that is why, many times there is confusion. She has written everything very clearly and distinctly and she has written it in all its purity. And she has written in it that when Christ went to a wedding He transformed water into the juice of grapes. This is a fundamental point that she has written in Marathi.

The second amazing thing is that about the childhood of Christ and about boyhood of Christ I have not read any poem in English language. I don’t know, have you ever heard a poetry piece about the description of Christ’s childhood? I have never heard one. But in Marathi we have many. Now, just yesterday they sang beautifully, “Baala vadana tava baghuni Krista”. After seeing your small child’s face – after seeing your face, your child like face – “Baal Vadana” – all my fears run away. So all this part is missing in the Western languages. I think that the childhood themes are not there. We have about Krishna, about Rama, when they were children, how they used to walk, how they used to talk, how they used to put their finger in the mouth. Every little, little thing is described so beautifully about children. And that is how I think, Indians cannot think of killing their children at all. I mean it’s an impossible situation. Even in Hindi language, in Marathi language, we have such beautiful descriptions of these incarnations as children.

Then the third thing, which is surprising, is that all their romance is before the marriage. After marriage there is no romance left! Third thing is that there is no romance described after marriage. All before marriage. It is the other way around in Indian languages: all the romance comes when you are married  – very sweet, sweet things. I was surprised – I asked somebody to find out one English book where they have described the romance of the married couple. None! Finished! All the romance is over. Once you are married it is finished. Then what do you do? You quarrel, you fight, you go to the courts, take a divorce. That description is not there. And this is the significant thing that on us (Indians) there is a very big blessing of our Indian culture, very big! Please, remove that. Someone can come and remove it.

So I have read the translation of the Bible in Marathi. And whatever is written there, has great depth. I feel that English language has changed its essential nature. And even with regard to Christ, His sacred identity and spiritual significance has been preserved in the Marathi Bible. This is not there in the Hindi translation, nor is it there in the English version.

The third thing is that the Maharashtrians have high self esteem. In Rajasthan also, the people from Mewar are very self esteemed. They would not learn anything from the British. If the English tried to teach them they would say, “Leave it. No need. We have seen many like you”. But in the North of India I have seen that they are greatly impressed by the English. Wearing good suits, wearing ties, boots, commanding and ordering others. It’s not so in Maharashtra. To get a Maharashtrian wear a suit is the most difficult thing! They wear dhotis. Even educated people wear only dhotis. You can see that Tilak, who was such a great leader in the country, or we had Ranade (great leader) or Agarkar (great leader), all of them – no one wore suits and boots. No one used to wear tie or anything. Of course, if they are in government jobs, that is a different matter.

But here, even to be employed in a government job was considered below ones’ dignity and status. In Maharashtra, you must be knowing, that many times it has been written, it has been written many times, “Why don’t you take a government job?”. And they would mention three-four names of government officials as an example that they were doing well. But there is no honor and glory in a government job. Not at all! My father used to say that working for someone was inferior. Better to have your own profession. And a government job is the lowest form of employment. It destroys a person’s character. And I’ve seen this is very true. Now, if someone gets into the IAS (Indian Administrative Service), then finished. His value goes up in the marriage market – 30 lakhs, 35 lakhs. An IAS Officer in North India is considered a big man. Here it’s not so.

But here, if a man is educated, if he is a scholar, then he is appreciated; and most of all if he is spiritually sound. This is a very great difference. And that is why in the early days in Delhi, I used to wonder what will these people understand? But it is most amazing, that in Delhi, Sahaja Yoga has spread so wide; in Lucknow also. I just cannot believe! With whose blessings has it happened? These people were so badly servile to the British. What has happened to them now? How did they get transformed? I feel that where Shri Rama and Shri Krishna, made their divine abodes, there reside their blessings. There is no other explanation. Especially Lucknow, which was a place of indulgence – eat, drink and have fun – they were all indulgent and carefree...

I always hesitated as I did not know what to talk to such people. All their relationships, discussions, I just couldn’t understand. I was coming from Maharashtra and just couldn’t understand their way of life. Making fun of daughter-in-law or making fun of sister-in-law, it never made sense to me! And now I perceive there the blessings of Shri Rama and Shri Krishna, the poetry of Kabir, the blessings of Nanak Sahib. Oh! These people of Punjab – I studied in Punjab, and I felt that in the brains of these people of Punjab, Sahaja Yoga will never enter! And now I was amazed! I am very amazed! So much bhakti and so much bliss and joy. How did they attain this? There were no big public programs there, nor did anyone give big lectures. How did all this happen? Now in Maharashtra I really worked hard Oh my God! So many villages and hamlets I visited and worked very hard. But in Maharashtra it did not spread so much. The quality I found in North India it is not in Maharashtra. It is really surprising. I thought, all My efforts in Maharashtra will go in vain. On the contrary they got after Me!

So, I discovered one thing, that there are a lot of false gurus there! So many gurus! Everyone has a personal guru; each home has a guru; It was overrun with gurus! Even in the Panchaang (astrological calendar) even there, every guru’s name, date of birth, place etc. is recorded! Oh My God – all completely useless people. Of course there were a few genuine gurus also but very few. Very few. The others, such useless gurus, are either interested in money or interested in women! This large land of Maharashtra, such a sacred land, has been blessed by the different aspects of the Devi Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati, Mahakali and Adi Shakti – all of them have place in this Mahashtra. And the eight Vinayakas and Mahavinayaka, are all sitting here. One thing is that these people are not immoral, they have no dirty thoughts, but they have no capability to understand what is dharma, They don’t have the capacity. They only know going to the temples, ringing the bells and running after gurus for salvation. They are too much ritualistic people. There is no other problem of immorality with them. But they are so steeped in ritualism that they are not able to come out of all these habits. I have given you the analysis of the situation, this way.

The foreigners from whom I had no expectations whatsoever – I used to feel what kind of people are these, they have no understanding of anything – and they have reached such heights. And the people of the North whom I never thought that they would come to Sahaja Yoga... I used to call Dilli (Delhi) as Billi(cat). My marriage took place in Delhi. My father also lived in Delhi. I had no hopes from North India. But, it is a very surprizing thing that today in Delhi and further North of Delhi, in Punjab,  in  U.P., all over, in Rajasthan, Sahaja Yoga has spread. But Maharashtra it is a misfortune. And because of it, your coming here is very important. Because of your chaitanya, a lot of awakening can take place here and people can feel it. By your coming here, your attention also comes to this place, and by that, in Mahashtra all the false gurus settled here – there are lots of them still... In Maharashtra there is a saying “Ucchal Bangdi Karle”. I cannot tell you the translation of this. The job of picking and throwing them out can be achieved only through your Chaitanya.

Especially today, when you are worshiping the pure personality of Christ, His purest life, you are offering respect to Him, I would definitely say that, that all these so many false gurus settled here – which Christ, if He was here, He would have whipped them with a hunter – all such false gurus would be compelled to pick up their wares and run away! And after running away, I don’t know where they will go. They have made a lot of money, and befooled many people. But there is also a kind of narrow-mindedness, a kind of foolishness in people here. Any guru comes they will prostate at his feet. There are a lot of “feet touching” devotees here! So this is one thing inside us: the capacity to get befouled! I don’t know from where it has come. Whoever comes and teaches anything, its our heritage: “Gurudev has come!”. It is due to this blind following that the spiritual culture of Maharashtra has been destroyed. And I would say that, today when you are worshipping the life of Christ, His simplicity, His purity, the weapon of His innocence, the power of Shri Ganesha, will definitely destroy these people, and in Maharashtra the spiritual awakening will take place as well.

Here also the people will achieve that spiritual treasure and Param Tattwa (Divine essence) which existed in so many saints here. There was no saint who did not mention about Kundalini. All the saints here talked about Kundalini. Saints, one greater than the other lived in this land. I think about those saints in this country, who have worked so hard here, and tried to awaken spirituality. Here, even I could not succeed. But I congratulate you for coming here. Your coming here will definitely put sense into these people. They will realise that they are just running after false gurus. I am telling you all this because many people suggested that, “Mother, instead of Ganapatiphule, You should have your program in our place”. But I said “No! You come here!” Because it is your duty that you bring about awakening within everybody.

Spiritual awakening in Maharashtra is imperative. So it is necesary for you to come here. And that too, here (Ganapatipule) – the place of Shri Jesus Christ – we honor it by our coming. He is very important here. I tell you., He will take the whip to whip all these false gurus and finish them off. But you must know that today we are here to worship and awaken His supreme divinity. And with His power, Maharashtra will become purified and holy. They do a lot of worshipping of Ganesha, they worship Ganesha a lot. But who is Shri Ganesha, what does He stand for – all this they do not know. I don’t understand this. They are so entangled in this mess; and to release them it is necessary for you to come here. To come every year, and worship and celebrate the birthday of Christ is a great undertaking. My unending blessings to all of you.
