Public program at Hotel Krasnapolski, 1994 Amsterdam

I bow to all the seekers of truth. At the very outset, you have to know that truth is what it is. You cannot change it. You cannot describe it. Unfortunately, at this human awareness you cannot know it. Moreover, truth is not going to compromise with anything. (Aside: speaking everyday makes your throat...) Now the... whatever I am going to tell you, you have not to take it for granted; because we have had lots of problems with blind -folded faiths. But keep your mind open as a scientist. And treat it as... (aside: come along, sit here) And treat it like a hypothesis. And if it proves, then you have to accept it as honest people, because it is for your benevolence, for it is the benevolence of your country, your countrymen and humanity at large.

The truth is that you are not this body, this mind, this intellect, these emotions, your conditionings and your ego: but you are the pure Spirit. We say: my emotions, my feelings, my intelligence, my ego. Who is this ‘my’ which owns...?

The second truth is that there is an all pervading power of divine love which does all the living work. We see these beautiful flowers, it’s a miracle. In Holland you get so beautiful flowers. We never even think how they are coming out of the mother earth of different shapes so beautifully.

So the second truth is that there is a subtle power of divine love which does all this living work. If you ask a doctor; who runs your heart, he’ll say it’s the autonomous system. But who is this ‘auto’? They’ll say it’s the parasympathetic nervous system. But doctors know nothing about parasympathetic. There are so many things that science cannot answer. It can only tell you about whatever things are there, but not about things which do not come in the range of our senses.

They cannot tell you why you are on this earth. And so many people nowadays feel identity problems. They are not satisfied with what they have and they think that they can have something more than this. These are special people called as seekers of truth. Like William Blake has said, “Men of God will be born in those days and they will discover their divinity, will also give the divinity to others.”

But these seekers of truth are lost in many ways. Some think by reading books they will achieve the truth. I met one girl just now who was selling Gita and saying “Hara Rama, Hare Rama.” I told her, “What is written in this book is that you should have your Self knowledge. That you have to have self-realisation.” It is like any sign board that says, “You do this, or you will get that.” Like somebody has a headache, you say “Take aspirin.” and you’ll go on reading the prescription, “Take aspirin. Take aspirin.” You’ll have more headache.

Kabira has said, “Pari pari pandita mouraka baye” meaning “By reading books, even the learned have become stupid!” I could not understand. How can that be? But now I have met many like that.

Also like Christ has said you are to be born again. So some people take the brand; ‘Born Again’. How do you become born again suddenly? Actually in Sanskrit language a bird is called as ‘vijaha’, meaning twice born and a realized soul is also called as ‘vijaha’. So the person who has his second birth, is a transformed personality. Supposing you brand an egg as ‘bird’, will it become a bird? But clubbing is a common nature with human beings I think, anything absurd they want to club with.

When we are fed up with all the chaos of modern times, people take to religion and to seeking. But all these religions also, are either power-oriented or money-oriented. They kill people in the name of God. And they make money in the name of God. How can God understand money? Does he understand banking, which is our headache? Does he know economics? If he had known, it would have been better I think.

So any intelligent person has to understand that if these religions were created, it was for our balance, for our moral life. And why moral life, because for your ascent.

It is a very difficult thing. If you read the Bible, fifth chapter of Mathew, Christ has described what he expects a Christian to be. It is impossible for human beings to do that. He says, “Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes.” Even in your mind there should not be adultery. In all the Christian nations, you cannot find one person like that. And they say they are Christians. I was also born in the Christian religion. But he says that if somebody slaps you on your right cheek, you turn your left to them. But in India missionaries came with a gun in one hand and the Bible in another hand. Christ never understood what sort of human beings he was talking to. It is impossible that he is asking, very difficult. Up to the point, he said, if your one eye is bad, doing bad things, take it out and throw it away. And if one arm is doing something wrong, cut it off. This is like Sharia inflicted upon yourself. (Translator doesn’t understand) Like Sharia of the Muslims, inflicted upon yourself, not on others.

Christ could crucify himself, he was such a great incarnation. He never understood human beings, I think they all never understood. All these religions were born on the same tree of spirituality at different times. We plucked these flowers and now we are fighting with the dead flowers. None of them now, are Spirit-oriented.

When I started seeing this, I felt something else has to be done about them. They are completely in darkness, and very badly conditioned. If some light comes in them, they will see for themselves, they will become so powerful themselves that they can really transform their lives.

Sahaja yoga; ‘saha’ means with is born, with you is born this yoga, the union with this divine power. It is your fundamental right to have this yoga. Nobody can deny it. But only thing, you have to ask for it. You have to desire it.

Now this power, in the triangular bone that you see, it’s a little minute for you, (Indicating chart of chakras) but there is a power they have shown in the sacrum bone, meaning the Greeks knew that this is a sacred bone. But they told me that, after this Orthodox Church came in, they said this is all nonsense. They had Athena. ’Atha’ in Sanskrit means primordial - primordial Mother. And they worshipped her as the primordial Mother. In India we call her Adi Shakti. It is described that she incarnated in Greece. “Manipur he diwipe.” But unfortunately, in the Bible Mr Paul, who hated women, never had any primordial mother. He had the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost, that too a pigeon, white pigeon. How can you have the father and the son and no mother?

That is how the women I find in the West are really not treated well. And all the time they have to please men. They have to expose their body, otherwise men cannot be satisfied with them. If you ask an Indian lady to expose her body, she’ll slap. To her, her chastity is her power.

So everything went upside down with this kind of thing. Like Mr Paul coming in, and for the Koran there is a fellow called Mohaya who authorized the Koran. He killed three kalifas. He killed Hazrat Ali. He killed his two sons, Hazrat Ali’s two sons and his mother ate the liver of one of the kalifas. At least, even Hitler never ate somebody’s liver. Such a horrible man like him has authorized the Koran.

And the Sharia that they have has come actually from the Old Testament, from Jeremiah. He has written about it, what Moses gave to these Jews. It was meant for the Jews but was taken over nicely by the Muslims. It is very sad the way they have made a mess of the whole thing.

So let us... because I think I am talking about it because there is some theologist sitting here. Now we have to read another book of knowledge which is within ourselves - he’s there, see! - which is within our being, which is created in our different evolutionary processes.

All these incarnations came at a different stage of our growth into spirituality. Our creator is the greatest organizer. So he made this beautiful central path for your ascent. This Kundalini is your own mother, your own individual mother. She knows everything about you. She knows your mistakes and your aspirations. Above all she loves you. And she has been waiting for a moment when she could be awakened.

This knowledge was known not only in India but in various places. But in India they had mastered this knowledge. But the only thing was that in tradition one guru used to give realization to one disciple in his life time. This lasted until about the twelfth century [1200s] when one of them published in his book, Gyaneshwara, he published in his book, in the sixth chapter, about Kundalini.

It’s a... we can say, an exposition of the Gita. But this Gita which was written, not by Sri Krishna, Vyasa, he wrote what you have to become. Just like what Christ said. Just like what the Koran says. So when everybody said the same thing, it was never told how to achieve it. That is how this knowledge was not given. Till the sixteenth century in India we had lots of great saints, like Guru Nanaka, Kabira, Namadeva, so many of them; in Maharashtra like Ramadasa, Tukaram. They also said that it’s the Kundalini which gives you realization, clearly. But people didn’t give any attention to it. Like Kabira has said that, “How am I to make them understand when the whole world is blind?” (Checked with audio (twice) till here – 30.34 mins.)

Now the situation is different. These are special times of the Last Judgment. These are special times according to the Koran, ‘Kiama’. It means resurrection time. “At this resurrection time,” Mohammed Sahib has said “your hands will speak. And they will tell you about you, they will give witness against you.” I mean they will tell you what’s wrong with you. They all have described it in small pieces, I must say. But the time has come.

Of course in the books, they have written something funny. That those who will die and will be buried, their bodies will come out and get resurrection, in the books like the Bible, in the Koran, also the Old Testament. It is absurd, after 500 years, what part of the body is going to come out of the graves, occupying all the lands with the dead bodies. In Italy they make even houses for the dead bodies. But according to Indian philosophy, many souls who are seeking will be born and there will be an enlargement of the population. This one can understand, which is a fact also. (To translator: You said it?) I don’t know how many languages I have to learn! Alright, so. The good news is, now the time has come. You can have en-masse realization. And it has worked out.

So, what happens when the Kundalini rises? If you see today’s world problems, they are mostly because of human beings. And most of the human problems are because of their centres. Physical, mental, emotional, even spiritual problems are because of these centres going out of order.

You’ll be amazed to know that Sahaja Yoga can cure cancer and many psycho-somatic incurable diseases. We have three doctors now who have got an M.D. (Doctor of Medicine) in Sahaja Yoga and there are many others who are now trying to make a chart, so called research. But in Russia they have invited me to a program for 15th of September where three thousand scientists and doctors are going to come.

The Russians are something special because they haven’t got our conditionings. At least 70% are not materialistic at all. Their government said you can have your flats, own it. They said we don’t want to own anything, it’s a headache. Now they are the ones... I mean I was amazed that St Petersburg’s oldest university   gave me an award which they have given to only ten scientists. Einstein is one of them. And I am the tenth one, just imagine. I said, “How can you give me like this, like Einstein?” They said “What? He has just worked on matter, but you have worked on human beings.” And their religious Patriarch, there are only two patriarchs, one in Moscow and St Petersburg, he himself has invited me. Can you imagine? Will ever our Pope think of meeting me? I could cure him. (Laughter and applause)

So we come to the point where we understand that this Kundalini nourishes all the centres, integrates them and you get a complete integration of yourself. So your physical, mental, emotional and spiritual problems are solved completely. Now the light of your Spirit comes into your attention.

Spirit is the reflection of God Almighty in your heart. But it just watches, it doesn’t interfere nor does it come into your attention before realization. But after this happening, the attention gets enlightened by the spirit. And the throbbing you feel in the heart starts expressing itself on your finger tips as cool breeze. That is the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.

So this Kundalini is the reflexion of the primordial mother, the Holy Ghost. That means that you feel this cool breeze which is actually the... you can call as ‘parama chaitanya’ in Sanskrit. Parama chaitanya has been described by Adi Shankaracharia the same as (?) ‘Sa leelam, sa leelam’ means cool and cool and cool, soothing.

Firstly, we are as either Christians or Hindus, we have to be born in some religion. And we carry the brand on our head. But whatever maybe our religion we can commit any, any sin. So it has no meaning. But after realization you become spontaneously righteous. Overnight I have seen people giving up drugs. Overnight. They give up all that is destructive for them. I never say “Don’t, don’t.” like Ten Commandments. No, no. Otherwise half of them will leave the hall. It is best if they can see it in their own light. And they should understand what is destructive for them and what is constructive for them.

Your attention becomes absolutely innocent, which Christ has described. You should know your innocence can never be lost. It is an eternal thing within. You might have spoiled it, there might be some clouds. But everything gets cleared out. And you just become like a lotus coming out of a dirty pond. It is because you are that. You are very glorified.

And your attention also becomes very powerful. A glance of such a person can bring such a solace, such a peace, such a blessing to the atmosphere. You can feel anybody’s vibrations sitting down here, (from someone) dead or alive. Of course you can feel your own vibrations, your own centres, sitting down here.

Now if you know how to correct your centres, you can correct yours and correct of others also. That’s how Christ cured so many people. But in America I cannot cure because the doctors have made a law. Anything done by non-doctor, he’ll be arrested. Even if Christ was there he would be arrested.

Americans also, less said the better. They have had only two hundred years history, two hundred years. Three hundred years, English were India. Only thing they did is to divide us into six, seven parts. So proud of themselves, they never learnt anything from us. So these Americans are now... they have no family system, they have no tradition of family system and now they are coming out with new ideas. You should not marry. You should not have families. Throw the children on the streets. You will be surprised their Coca Cola culture has spread up to China even.

Now we have to understand that within us lies all these powers, which can be easily awakened, and we can become our own masters. Above all what happens is that we jump into the ocean of joy. And joy is singular. When our ego is pampered, we feel happy. When it is punctured, we feel unhappy. Now, in this case it is just a witness state where you watch everything like a drama.

Actually with our mental projections we either live in the past or in the future. With our mental projection we can produce something from this side, another produces from that side, and then they’ll start quarrelling thinking they know everything. All problems are because of mental projections also. So we either think of the past or of the future and we are jumping on the cusp of the past and the future. But if I say ‘You be in your present’ you cannot.

But after this Kundalini passes through she elongates these thoughts and the centre part which is the present, you can feel it as ‘thoughtless awareness’. Where you are aware, but no thoughts. You are in the present which is the reality, because the past is finished and the future doesn’t exist. So you stand in the situation, in reality where your spirituality grows. Your hands start speaking as Mohammad Sahib has said. You can raise the Kundalini of others. You can give self realizations to others. You can feel the centres of others, even the children can feel, and you can diagnose the disease.

The second state we call it as ‘doubtless awareness’. Then you can start curing people. It’s a state which is achieved very easily. You don’t have to go to the Himalayas, stand on your heads in that cold. No, sitting in your chair. Because you all deserve it. They had to go to the Himalayas because they never deserved it, I think. I don’t understand what is the need of becoming a sanyasi and giving up family this and that. It is too much. It is all inside, nothing outside. Whether you shave your head or you wear some scanty dresses or some colour dresses, what will they make a difference?

With this you become absolutely normal. All your angularities drop out. All your frustrations drop out. I met one gentleman who had tied all his hair here. I said “Why are you doing it? He said “I am so frustrated that I am going to tie up my hair to something so that I get my realization.” Another very learned man I met him he said “I every day stand on my head.” I said “For what?” He said “Because of gravitational force the Kundalini will come to my head.” In a seed the plant comes up. Also the fire also goes against the gravity. How can Kundalini be awakened if you put your head down? Because his guru told him, I think.

These gurus are all making money. Why can’t you see? Very simple thing, how much money you gave to Christ? If you just cancel out the money part you’ll find out the guru very well. I feel ashamed as an Indian but also now there are many Americans who have come up.

But now we are going to have our self-realization. I must confess in this short lecture I cannot tell you everything about it. In the English language itself I have given thousands of lectures which you can get later on. Also you will get books later on.

In this hall there are beautiful lights. You have to just switch on one switch because it is all built in. In the same way it is built in in you. What is the use of telling about the history of electricity, how it came here and how it was brought here? You’ll be bored stiff. Actually there is no need to give this lecture also.

First is to give you realization. Which is your right, which is very simple and you all are going to get it. But you must have full self-confidence in you that you are going to get it. Firstly you don’t have to doubt yourself. Now those who don’t want it, I cannot force on them, because I respect their freedom. If you don’t want to have, it is very civil for you to leave the hall. But if you want it, you are welcome.

This Kundalini is the power of pure desire. While our desires are not pure. You know the laws of economics that wants are not satiable in general. Today we want a house, then we want a car, then we want a helicopter, then an airplane. I don’t know, it goes on like that. Whatever we want never satisfies.

Whether you are aware or not aware, this power is within you which is of pure desire. That is to become one with this all-pervading divine power. But there are three conditions.

The first one is, as you have to be very self-confident, you should not feel guilty at all. If you have done any mistakes in the past, it is finished. You should have faced it at that time. So please, know that if you were guilty, you would have been in jail, not here. If human beings can find faults with you, God cannot. Because he is the ocean of forgiveness. He knows you are human beings, you are not gods. And if you have committed mistakes, it’s all right. So have to forgive yourself.

The second condition is even easier. You have to forgive every one. They say it is difficult, they can’t forgive. But logically whether you forgive or don’t forgive, what do you do? You don’t do anything. But if you don’t forgive then you play into wrong hands and torture yourself. So what’s the use of going after this myth of not forgiving? The easiest thing is not to think about them and to say with full heart “I forgive every one of them.”

Now if you feel guilty, then this centre catches here on the left. Which gives you angina, which gives you spondalitis; it gives you also lethargic organs. So why to feel guilty? If I say don’t feel guilty, they run out of the halls. But if I say give me your confessions, I’ll have letters up to my head, condemning themselves. You have to respect yourself as I respect you, and you have to love yourself as I love you. Moreover if this centre is caught up at this moment how will the Kundalini rise? And especially this centre on the optic chiasma is like this, absolutely constricted like this. And if you don’t forgive, it won’t open. If you don’t forgive, it won’t open. As is it you have tortured yourself by not forgiving all your life and now you are going to miss the point; the most important thing of self realization. This is the last breakthrough of your evolution. That is what you are going to miss.

Third one is very simple that you have to take out your shoes. I request you because in England the first time I told them you have to take out your shoes, half of them walked out.

Silence

The last thing I have to request and to tell you, that Sahaja Yoga is a collective happening. You cannot do it at home. You have to come to our centres. But it is not like other gurus where they give one introductory letter and then they start asking money. No money. We have very, very simple centres but very good Sahaja Yogis who can tell you all about this inner knowledge. But if you don’t come, after next year when I come, you will tell me “Mother, I have cancer, I have this, I have that.” You have to grow, that is important.

It will take hardly ten minutes. And I assure you, you will all feel this all-pervading power. And the heat will go down. Can I request all of you to come forward here and sit in front, please. Those who are standing there also please. Please come forward. Come forward please. Yes, please. Please be seated. The children won’t trouble you. They are more sensible than anybody else. Most of them can feel the vibrations.

(To translator) Did you tell them about left and right side? (Translator: Not so much) Not so much. But you did.

Alright so we have this left side and right side as you have seen. The left side is for generating the power of desire. Right side is for your physical and for your mental activities. Or we can say for action. Alright.

Now, so you have to put your left hand towards me like this. And please know that this is symbolic of your expression of desire, mundane desire to have your self-realization. So now please use your right hand for the action to give nourishment to your centres on the left-hand side.

Explanation of realisation.

First correction finished to here. End of talk. 10th Oct 2012

So we put our right hand on our heart – in the heart resides the Spirit ... if you don’t want to do it you can go out.

Put your left hand towards me and your right hand on your heart.

Left hand like very important, this towards me.

You think too much.

All right, in the heart resides your Spirit.

If you become the Spirit, then you become your own master. Your own guru.

So please take your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen.

Which is the center for your mastery.

This is the center created by great prophets and great sages within us.

Now you have to take your hand in the lower portion of the abdomen on the left hand side.

Now this is the center for your .... please sit down ....

This is the center for your pure divine knowledge.

It can be explained to you later on.

Left hand towards me, madam. Yes please.

Then again you have to raise your hand in the upper portion of your abdomen.

Now on your heart.

Then in the corner of your neck and shoulder.

And turn your head to your right.

This is the center I have told you about. It is out of gear when you feel guilty.

It is quite lot in this hall today.

So please don’t feel guilty.

Take your hand on top of your forehead across and please bend your head.

This is the center, is for forgiving everyone.

Now, please, take your right hand on the backside of your head.

And push your head as far as possible.

Here without feeling guilty, without counting mistakes just for your satisfaction you have to ask forgiveness from the divine force.

Now the last center is very important - stretch your palm.

And put the center of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area.

Through which the Kundalini breaks through – comes out. To press it nicely you have to push back your fingers. And please put down your head. You have to move your scalp, clockwise, slowly 7 times. Bend your heads please – bend your heads. Press it hard and move it 7 times.

Self- realisation.

Now it’s over - that all we have to do. Now we have to close our eyes. You may take out your spectacles and please don’t open eyes before I tell you. Before that those who are sitting on the chairs have to take their feet apart because those are two powers. And you have to place your left hand on the left lap comfortably. Put the right hand on your heart and close your eyes. You can call me Mother or Shri Mataji, whatever you like.

In your heart you have to ask a question 3 times. This is a fundamental question about yourself. You have to say: Mother, am I the Spirit? Please ask. Now, if you become the Spirit you become your own master. So please put your right hand on the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. Here you have to ask another fundamental question to me. You ask me: Mother, am I my own master?

I have told you that I respect your freedom and I cannot force pure Devine knowledge on you. You have to ask for it.

So please take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen and ask 6 times, because this center has 6 petals. Please ,Ask 6 times: Mother, please give me pure Devine knowledge.

As soon as you ask for Devine knowledge the Kundalini starts rising the premule of the seed. Like the seed, the premule start rising.

Now you have to ( laughing...... starting so fast.) Enrich your centers with full self confidence.

Raise your right hand in the upper portion of the abdomen on your left hand side.

Here

You have to say with full self confidence 10 times. Mother, I am my own master.

I have already told you at the very outset that you are not this body, this mind, this emotions this intelligence     this conditionings the ego, but you are the Spirit.

So raise your right hand on your heart.

Here you have to say again with full self confidence 12 times; Mother, I am the Pure Spirit.

You have to know that this all pervading power is the ocean of love and compassion.

It is the ocean of knowledge and bliss.

But above all it is the ocean of forgiveness and whatever mistake you might commit can be easily dissolved in the ocean of forgiveness.

So please forgive yourself at this important moment and raise your hand into the corner of neck and shoulder.

Turn your head to the right and here you have to say with full confidence; 16 times; Mother I am not guilty at all.

Now. I have already told you that it is a myth if you forgive or don’t forgive.

But if you don’t forgive then you play in wrong hands

And at this junction, this important time, if you don’t forgive this center won’t open.

So please raise your     from your heart now not   from your heart.

Mother I forgive everyone in general.

Now, you have to take your     hand on the back side of your head   and turn your head upward.

Here you have to say ; O Divine power, if I have done any mistake knowingly or unknowingly please forgive me.

Now the last center is very important please, stretch the center of your palm fully and put your hand on the   fontanel bone area.

Please stretch your fingers backwards so there is a good pressure and please put down your head.

Here again I cannot cross over your freedom ,so move your scalp with the pressure7 times clockwise; Mother please give me myself realization, 7 times.

Please bend your heads.

Please bend your heads.

(Shri Mataji Is Blowing into the microphone.)

Now please take down your hands, open your eyes.

Just put your hands towards me like this, higher.

And watch me without thinking.

Now please put your right hand towards me like this, put down your hands, you can see if there is a cool or hot breeze that is coming out of your fontanel bone area.

So people get it high and some people get it low.

Now with the left hand towards me you see with your right hand if there is, bend your head and see if there is a cool or hot breeze that is coming out of your fontanel bone area.

If you have not forgiven you’ll get hot breeze also you should not doubt yourself.

Again with the right hand you can see if there is a cool......

Silence
