When I was leaving Prague all the Sahaja Yogis was crying and I was also crying. But after coming to Moscow all that sadness has gone now. I’m so overjoyed to see you all again here. I hope this time My coming is going to do something great for all of us.

(Sahaja Yogis are saying, “Jai Shri Mataji”, several times.)

...and very handy, I must say. I was rather worried when I heard that this problem in Russia1. But I see you quite all right? (Shri Mataji laughs).

(Sahaja Yogis. “Very good, very good. We did not know about the problem”.)

That seems. You are in the Kingdom of God2.

(A Sahaja Yogini. “I love You very much, Mata”.)

I love you too. I love all of you.

(Sahaja Yogis are saying, “Jai Shri Mataji”, several times. The leader of Ukraine said that all the Sahaja Yogis are happy when Shri Mataji is here.)

I’m happy Sahaja Yoga is spreading so much here in Russia. And when you tell this to others they also going to competition with you (Shri Mataji laughs). And they think that spiritually you’ll be very powerful one day and they’ll be left behind (Shri Mataji smiles). And one fellow asked Me, “Mother, I hope there is sufficient place in the Kingdom of God for all of us.” (Shri Mataji laughs).

(Sahaja Yogis are saying, “Jai Shri Mataji”, several times.)

And I told them how Russian understand Sahaja Yoga so easily, they are not conditioned. And they are also not so materialistic as the Western world is and very immoral. Very immoral and extremely violent. Now this all Nazi group is again rising. So Sahaja Yoga has to spread fast in all the countries where yet they are not contaminated by this.

People are going, say, from Austria to Czechoslovakia. And from Italy to Bulgaria. And from Switzerland to Poland. And Romania French people are looking out. They were hundred and twenty Romanians who came to meet Me in Hungary. So Czechoslovakia and Hungary is looked after by Austrians. It’s all working out very well in all these countries. Even in Austria we have lots of good Sahaja Yogis, very matured Sahaja Yogis. In France also we have many. So much so that people are now frightened of us (Shri Mataji laughs). Because they are false people, they are making money in the name of God also. And they are afraid that falsehood will exposed very soon.

They are very proud of you, all of them. And they think...

(Sahaja Yogis are saying, “Jai Shri Mataji”, several times.)

I’m also very proud of you. You have become very...

(Sahaja Yogis are saying, “Jai Shri Mataji”, several times.)

... you have become very deep Sahaja Yogis.

May God bless you.

(A Sahaja Yogini presents her handwork to Shri Mataji and describes it, “Kundaliny, Mooladhara, Swadishthana, Nabhi, Anahata, Vishuddhi, Agnia and ...”)

Sahasrara.

(Yogini, “Sahasrara. In order to embroider the letters of Your name...”)

Exact, exact colors.

(Yogini, “In order to embroider the letters of Your name there had to be threads out of the Sun and the Moon rays.)

Beautiful. You have taken so much so much trouble.

(Another Sahaja Yogini, “ She is a Sahaja Yogini from Lenigrad and she wanted to express her great love to You”.).

Thank you, very kind of you.

(Yogini. “Is it nice?”)

Very beautiful.

(Yogini. “I’m happy, I’m happy.”)

Every colors is absolutely the same!

(Yogini. “She made it in the state of meditation being in front of the Photograph and she thought that You blessed her”.)

Of course.

(Sahaja Yogis are presenting flowers to Shri Mataji).

So beautiful flowers. Thank you very much. Spasibo.3

1 It was a historical date of August 19, 1991 when H.H. Shri Mataji has come to Moscow. This day started a military coup d'etat in the USSR by some orthodox sticklers of the old communist regime who named themselves as GKChP. So in the early morning armored forces had occupied Moscow and some other main cities of the USSR and President Gorbachev was arrested. The state of emergency was declared and any social gatherings were prohibited, all the theatres, cinemas, restaurants, etc. were closed. (The only exception in Moscow was H.H. Shri Mataji’s public program!) Many people (and some Sahaja Yogis too) were afraid of the possibility of civil war then. But in a few days the situation has changed dramatically – the USSR has broken out into the Independent States, the absolute power of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was finished, and people have got some democracy, so further propagation of Sahaja Yoga became possible there.

2 Shri Mataji has cited that instance several times in Her talks to explain how we should behave in any precarious situation – there is no any threat when the Mother is here. (Transcribers note)

3 It is “Thank you” that Shri Mataji has said in Russian. (Transcribers note).
