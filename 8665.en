Spill this out! Slowly, slowly take this out. Just slowly. Slowly, both of you should do because it may fall. This water is important because you can use it for your gardens and things, all right?

We have to thank Don, because he's the one who came to Spain and who did the... May God bless you!

Now if you could just bring all these things you know, here and just you can go on saying the mantra of the 108 names you can't say, 21 names you don't have here anything, so say the mantras of the 7 chakras, that's all. And I'll wash My hands in something like that. Warren you can do that. Seven Chakras. You can start it. Just keep it here. I'll tell you one by one; you pour it in My hand Little bit of ghee, little one spoon. Come along, you have to say the mantras of the seven chakras. All right? All of you should say. Make it little slower.

Yogini: Spanish ones, Shri Mataji?

Shri Mataji: You have the Spanish one, isn't it? Or you have.... Spanish ladies, from Spain. How many there are?

Yogini: Just three, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: It's all right. So very lucky! Open it. You have to take the photographs now. Get the photographer. Spanish photographer you should that.

Yogini: There is a crown for You, a crown there.

Shri Mataji: Ha? It's a crown? Got daisies first time! Let Me have a mirror. They look nice on Me, the daisies, with the white saree; first time I Am in Puja in white saree. Have you noticed that? First time in a white saree, isn't it surprising? Coming for the program. Just take the photograph now. I think, I think miracles may take place today, with the white saree, I don't know, may be.

Yogi: It's the ninth day of the moon, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: Yes, very nice day. Eighth day is very good, Ashtami, is the best day for the Puja. I seldom have a white, except for the Shiva Puja.

Take of the Feet also, take it nicely of the Feet. Specially for the Spanish. All right?

First time the daisy, first time the white. It's surprising. You take it without the blue saree then, isn't it, the white looks nice, this combination looks nice. May God bless you! May God bless today all the Spanish sahaja yogis. Let Spain take to Sahaja Yoga very fast and transform themselves.

And all those today who have been in the program and yesterday, should all take to Sahaja Yoga seriously and work it out. They must respect their Realization... and must pay full attention and importance to their lives. May God bless them all with wisdom. May God bless you all.

You see the Kundalini. You take out your coat, otherwise I can't see. Can you take out his coat? I can't see your Kundalini. Ask him also, take out his coat. I want to see your back. Bend down full; bend down full. May God bless you all!

Now the only chakra which I feel is the right Nabhi, that means you all have little bit of a problem of food. So look after it. May God bless you! May God bless you! May God bless you!

You look after your livers, that's important. Heat, ah... say, and the food, I think your food here is very oily, I think. Try to reduce fats, you see. It's very oily food you have.

Yogi: There's a gift for you, Mother.

Shri Mataji: What is that? Thank you. What is that? Fan... aah! I brought two fans when I was coming to Spain, I brought two fans. I knew it will be hot. In India we have fans everywhere. Can you open this for Me? What is that?

Next time I will come for more time to Spain.

Yogi: Shri Mataji, I just would like to thank all the Spanish sahaja yogis the way they welcome us, it remind us very much India and the Indians how they welcome us with warmth and love and affection. Even if it would have been 1000 miles more... we would have been very happy to meet them. It was very beautiful.

Shri Mataji: You have to learn from them. One has to learn from this.

Yogi: We have been to the seaside Shri Mataji, we got sea here in this country, we have got mountains so to remind them that we are still surrounded by mountains in our country, we have a poster for all the sahaja yogis just to see that Shri Mataji is crowned not only by he sea, but by the mountains, too. It's the mountain of Shri Ganaraj.

Shri Mataji: Just open it.

Yogi: It is a colour photograph they can give to people, from you Shri Mataji.

All of you can have one. This is the one - really remarkable, isn't it? Just My Hand. You might say I was holding a light or something. Very remarkable, it's very remarkable. Slowly, slowly one can expose oneself. Isn't it? And this one is?
