Public Program

I bow to all the seekers of truth. At the very outset, I have to say you should know what is the truth. Everybody is seeking the truth. But they have no idea as to what they should find.

There is an urge within us. Because these times are special. And we are seeking. But still, we don't have a clear cut idea as to what we should seek and what we should achieve after our seeking. I would like to refer, to all those great books on religion, about truth. They all have said that you have to know yourself. Knowing yourself is the point and that you have to become the spirit. It's said in all these religions but we can find, that these religions are not really doing that. They're not yet able to give you the truth.

That is why there is so much of conflict, so much of fights going on.

There are really religions, no doubt. And the essence of every religion is the same. Despite all that they're fighting in the name of the religion, how can that be? It can be explained very well that if you have lost your way, we can go into opposite directions. So when we know that we have to know ourselves, and that is our goal of life, that is how we are going to improve on our...

Life is such that has been not so clearly explained. But, where there is an argument within us or not, is been told by most of them, and that argument has must have been told to you, lies in the triangular bone 3 and a half coils of energy, which is divine, which can connect us to the all-pervading power of truth, which is a very subtle energy. When that happens, you get connected with that power. And that power starts flowing through you. You can feel it on your fingertips that power flowing. This is a fact. We have to first verify before denying it. If it could happen to you all that you can feel this all-pervading power on your fingertips. Then it's an experience, it's, not just by giving you a big lecture or telling you about something fantastic, but it is actualization. The most important thing is the actualization is the becoming of your being the Spirit. This has to happen, all kinds of acrobats people may tell you. It's, absolutely, I must say, is a false pretext. No amount of acrobats are necessary.

It is Sahaj. Sahaj means spontaneous, it is within you. All of you have this power. All of you are capable of becoming the Spirit, but you must understand what you should expect, what you should become Unless and until you have a proper value system about it nothing can be explained. And you can be misled by all other nonsensical things. Of course, you can't pay for it because it's a living process of your evolution. Now you are at a human awareness, but it's, not so fluent. You have to rise higher, higher into the realm of spirituality. It's, not spiritualism, but spirituality, where you become the Spirit, the master. It's, not difficult at all, I assure you, it's not difficult. America has been some in the last place because I came a long time back, to begin with. But I found people were running after all kinds of business nonsensical people. Then I gave up. I said I would go to America after 9 years, and then I came, and gradually I started understanding that they are seekers. They're really seekers. Not that they are in any way hypocritical, but it is the way people are enticing them and taking them under their own control, that they can not see the point and the point is, you can't do anything about it. A person may come and tell you: "you must get detached, give me all your property, all your money, then I will give you two pair of clothes to wear". So many have done that by doing this kind of nonsense. Are you going to enter inside yourself? Is it possible? Just think of it. So many people have come here telling you all kinds of stories. In your humble seeking, you have been mislaid, and I feel very sorry for it. Now try to understand that you have been very special people as human beings. And that you have to become a super-human being, we can call the greatly evolved soul we have so many. We had so many, and those we had, we call them by different names. They were called the Sufis and big master's, but they are not intelligible, normally to people, because unless and until you have the awareness, which is enlightened by your Spirit, you cannot understand what they're talking about. Now the time has come for all of you to get your realization. You have been seeking for ages. It is already described in books that the day will come the time will come. They call it as Kali Yuga is the worst time that is now. At this time, people who are seeking God in the hills and dales, we'll get into proper family life, and they will get their self-realization through this Kundalini awakening. Now, in the name of Kundalini, also lots of nonsense has been said, which is surprising. How people accepted that Kundalini can be dangerous and a person who gets in Kundalini awakening will be very much harmed. Now she is your Mother. Kundalini is your exclusive Mother, She knows each and everything about you She knows about your false and also your aspirations, everything is recorded in Her and She's, extremely careful when She gives you the second birth, and She takes up all your problems upon Herself, She doesn't bother you. She doesn't trouble you and she's, the one who looks after your second birth. Again, I say, is actualization, the actualization of baptism you can call it, but it's not the way they do. It's actualization it happens that this rises passes through 6 centres and pierces through your fontanel bone area. and you do feel on your hands, fingers, and out of your head, the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost. This has to happen. Otherwise, whatever stories one matter, you should not believe. It has to show results. Now the centres that we have. All these 7 centres are responsible for our physical, mental, emotional and spiritual being, so many people get cured. Many people have problems mentally, they get cured, and spiritually you get endowed with the absolute knowledge, not knowing that we learned in the schools or colleges, but their knowledge, which is absolute. For example, if you want to know about someone, you can ask a question and you'll be amazed. If the question is yes, then you start getting the cool breeze flowing fast. But if it is no or it is wrong, then you might get a little tingle or might get very hot from those persons who are to be tested. It's, a very, very interesting precise and a scientific method. Now, if there are doctors, I would like to tell that you get in control with the parasympathetic nervous system. Luckily, there's going to be a big conference with Me with the doctors in New York, I don't know what the association it is. In that, they are convinced now. That what I'm saying is a fact and that helps you. You get cured by yourself. And you can also cure others. There is no need to have this horrible modern diseases that you are afraid of. You can just find out about it in no time. Apart from that you just know how to treat others, how to cure others, how to help others. But apart from that, what you get is a spiritual blessing. And the spiritual blessing is this that you get the peace in your heart. Surprisingly, when this Kundalini rises She some or other, by joining with the Divine power, all providing power, assumes the personality, which is extremely pure, extremely benevolent, extremely tolerant, extremely truthful. All your enemies that we call like anger, lust, greed, all these enemies just dropped and you are no more in the entanglement of those and you become a free person, absolutely a free person, above all. You are so beautiful, you become such a nice person that established your peace. Normal human beings. What do they do? They react. They reacted on it. See, they were telling Me that still there, this time people are still coming, doesn't matter. You can come late. There is no "don't come just now", right? But I don't know how to react, and that's why when I came to see molested, you look very relaxed I said, I never reacted to that, so you don't react. By not reaction what happens that the thoughts that come to you come from the future and the past and you are lost in those thoughts because they're jumping on the cuss of this thoughts when the Kundalini rises, the thoughts are like these. She lingers those thoughts and space is created, which equalities pause or ... In that state, you've become absolutely peaceful. You don't think anymore, we call it thoughtless awareness. That Jung has described. That means you watch anything, just as a witness, see everything as a witness. See, this is a nice carpet here. I see it. Supposing it belonged to Me If I was normal, I would have said, oh My God, I don't know. How are they going to keep it? In case this belongs to somebody else I would appreciate it, and I say, oh, I must buy this, how much it will cost, I hope it's insured and all kinds of things. But if I am the realized person, then I just watch it without thinking and the joy that the artist has put into this carpet enables you to enjoy, enjoy it without reaction. And this state, we call it Sahaja was done where a person becomes absolutely one with himself. Complete. When he looks at anything, he doesn't react, he sees, he becomes the witness, you become just a witness of the holy things. Your memory improves, your ideas about creation, anything. I mean, you become an extremely, extremely I should say creative person, and you don't develop the pride. You don't develop falsehood, but just enjoy creating something. A human being is the most useful thing and the most beautiful thing the Divine has created. But we don't know what we are. Thatâ€™s why always it is said, no ..., no yourself. Unless and until you know yourself, how can you say "I hate myself" or "I do, I do that". Actually, the beauty lies within you and is to be expressed through these Divine vibrations. Now the health improves no doubt, so many have improved their health, but I've seen in London in the beginning, so many boys were taking drugs. Give it up overnight. I never say, "don't, give up". I don't say "don't..". If you say "don't", then they will have and then will run away. Let them take, let them get their realization then automatically, the whole thing drops out, and you shoot up out of that and become the real personality. That's you know the reality because you're not any more contaminated by your ego or your superego. These thoughts come to you from your ego or superego meaning your conditioning, you're no... You're absolutely free and you see everything in its real position. This kind of thing happened was already destined. Has been already prophesied. That is going to happen in those days. And so if (you can come here, this side we have chairs). Alright. So this is how we are going to become ourselves and we will know what we are and what we are capable of. Our capabilities are fathomless, but unless and until we are connected, how can we act, for example, this instrument, if it is not connected to the means, it is useless. In the same way, you are to be connected to the means, is very important. For that, you don't have to do anything. It just works spontaneously within you. And you get your self-realization without any doubt. Actually, I must have given thousands of lectures all over the world and there's no end of it. I would like you, people, to ask Me some questions, which I would like to answer if you have any.

Yogi: Is there any questions? You could raise a hand? Seeker: What is the purpose of having the photograph? Shri Mataji: If you can do without the photograph nothing like it. But you need something to support and that's why people use the photograph if you don't need it, it's alright.

Shri Mataji: Alright, very good question, Paramatma is the God Almighty, alright? And His power is the addition is the power that has done all the creation, everything, while Paramatma is the one who is just a spectator of the whole things, Drishta they call it. While Adi Shakti is the one who does all the creation and everything. Paramatma is in your heart reflected as Spirit. And Kundalini is reflected in your triangular bone as Adi Shakti. Adi Shakti's reflection is Kundalini. Oh, you'll get absolute knowledge, everything.

Seeker: What should come first?

Shri Mataji: What should come first? What?

Seeker: The Kundalini awakening or dissolving the jealousy in other ...?

Shri Mataji: No, no, Kundalini awakening is the one by which all these things happened. Automatically.

Seeker: Is it not first necessary to work on the negative tendencies and then get the Kundalini awakening?

Shri Mataji: There is no need. In Sahaja Yoga, there's no need to work it out. The negative forces themselves run away, 99%. In 1% maybe it still sticks, but otherwise, a ninety-nine per cent. They all run away with the light of the Kundalini with the enlightenment of the Spirit in your attention.

Seeker: Can I continue with my best chief (?) as long as I'm awakening my Kundalini?

Shri Mataji: Yeah, of course. No doubt. You only, on the contrary, you've become a multidimensional personality. You try, you can do it. If you're doing something wrong, you can't do it after Kundalini awakening, because you see what is destructive for you and what is constructive. So you don't do it. You just don't do it. I told you just now that overnight people gave up drugs. I didn't tell them. Is the light. If you are sitting in the darkness, you don't know where are you. But if there is light, you know, everything is like that is enlightenment I'm talking about.

Seeker: What is the first step to not desire?

Shri Mataji: Just to desire that you should get your self-realization. You must have a strong desire.

Yes, madam. Huh?

Seeker: By practising this can I control my heartfelt?

Shri Mataji: Everything, everything. If it's controlling, you don't have to do.

Seeker: Because of practising a Christian religion she feels that she is going to hell

Shri Mataji: Correct.

Seeker: and does that mean that by practising this it will be the same?

Shri Mataji: I was also born in a Christian religion and I know that how Christianity was just opposite of Christ, but (just a minute). But after realization, you are enlightened, and you see the beauty of every religion and the essence of every religion. And then you also understand that you are capable yourself of following a spiritual part without any difficulties, nothing destructive, nothing wrong nothing manipulated. It's, your own. You become your own master.

Seeker: Have you ever met before Mahatma Yoganath and are you follow his teaching?

Shri Mataji: Those who have met... I've nothing to say.

Seeker: Have you leave your body and travel?

Shri Mataji: I don't want to do that. What's the use it is done through some spirits I think. Yes, madam.

Seeker: She has a desire she has love, but so many forces pull you away from that... Shri Mataji: Yes it's correct. But just now, just now, I promise you that you will get your realization. And then you'll see all these forces would drop out, alright?

[not English]

Yes, this means the left side is caught up, who is written this letter? That means the left side is not alright. But it can be put right.

Seeker: You said that it is a special time. Talk a little bit more about that.

Shri Mataji: Its called ghtas Kali Yuga. And also this is the time of last judgment.

And at this time, one has to be very careful because you are going to be judged whether you take to the truth or not. If you are still with falsehood, you are judged you will judge yourself, nobody needs to judge you. By so many things will happen that we realized there's something wrong.

Seeker: What was the advice that Mahatma Gandhi gave to you when you was little?

Shri Mataji: He didn't give Me any advice. I had to give him advice. But he did say that let our country be free. Then you can start your Sahaja Yoga program, not before that. That was his idea that we are not yet free to propagate anything.

Seeker: After you awakening Kundalini tonight how often should we do it?

Shri Mataji: Very good question. You don't have to.. there is no number of times, you have to do it on the ones it is enlightening It is enlightening. But we have problems still there. So the Kundalini goes back to correct it sometimes, so we have here a proper "follow up" they call it, and after that, we have centres where you can go. Also, nobody will charge any money. And they'll find out for wrong with you and that all try to tell you what is to be done. It happens with very few, but you'll enjoy going to the centre because it's all enjoyment there. Free of charge.

Seeker: Does that mean that we should not do this very often ourself alone?

Shri Mataji: There will tell you, you have to meditate, that they will tell you how to meditate. And if you follow it for ten-fifteen minutes at the most, and it works out and you can grow, because after all this first germination of the seed, you see is there. But it has to grow and some people grow so fast. I'm surprised some times that at the very first meeting, only they become great people.

Seeker: Does the Kundalini ever become ...?

Shri Mataji: No It does not. But if you try not to pay attention, to its proper alignment or proper development then it becomes static at that point. But it never goes back.

Seeker: For many years I've been trying to meet you and I'm very blessed to see you here.

Shri Mataji: I see.

Seeker: Ones we have got it what can we do to bring more peace to our community?

Shri Mataji: You can do it if you're desired so you can really help them you can really help.

I mean that's what is happening now as you see these people say that Sahaja Yoga is working in eighty-six countries. What happened that one person got his realization he went to his country and he changed so many people. In a far fish country like Benin imagine Benin where they have mostly Muslims there are seven thousand Sahaja yogis. In Turkey, we have three thousand. And in so many places we have but the maximum in Benin where there are mostly people who are who were Muslims. And I was surprised why did you become Muslims? So they said because the French were here and we didn't like the way they're were immoral so we thought their religion is no good so became Muslims but now they are great Sahaja yogis very very great Sahaja yogis. So many Muslim countries have become Sahaja yogis. All over the world, we have. In Russia, we have thousands and thousands and thousands. And the Russians are very deep people. I tell you the so-called freedom we had we have gone helter-skelter while the Russians had no freedom they could not even talk about God they did not read anything about Divine and they developed I think out of the communism developed within themselves a very, very deep understanding and they are there. You'll be amazed that Sahaja Yoga is now practised in so many countries where I never even thought I would reach, but Sahaja yogis have gone and done the job. ...

Seeker: What is your first recollection about your childhood of been awaken? How old were you?

Shri Mataji: Now, can I ask you one question? What was your first understanding that you are a human being? It's like that. As you were aware of your being a human being I was aware.

Seeker: You said you were born in a Christian family, so what is your faith what is your religion, what is your God?

Shri Mataji: I have no religion. I have all the religions. Born in any family should not sort of stop your region. You can see through everything if you have the light. This another one. Now I was, I'm must say. Here there are so many people were asking questions, normally, I don't find that experience. Doesn't matter. But how many will become good Sahaja yogis is to be seen out of you. It's, alright, to ask questions after questions, but that is of no value unless and until you really become what I'm saying, a Sahaja yogi, the real personality. That is absolutely spiritually so we have to see that, that is the challenge for all of you, let's see how many. I must say, Los Angeles has been really a lost Angeles, so far for Me. But Sahaja yogis always felt that I can do very well, so I came. Now, this is the fifth question you're asking, madam, will you please take your realization and then ask Me, alright? This another one. You see, once you have asked a question, you shouldn't ask another question, please. Because all of them are waiting for their Self Realization, they're all waiting for their Self Realization. Only a few who want to ask questions is one is alright. But not all the time go on asking questions. What is that? Unless and until you are a journalist? I'd be a ... But you'll find you'll need it. Alright.

Seeker: How do you awaken the Kundalini?

Shri Mataji: That's, My job I will do it, Alright? It's very simple. How does a Mother Earth sprout the seed? How does She do it? Is innately building in Her that power, isn't it? What else?

Seeker: What are the relationships between Paramatma and Kundalini?

Yogi: Can we start?

Shri Mataji: Yes, we should. Can you now write your questions and let Me know? I'll answer them after you get your Relation. Then you won't have any questions I know. Again, I said, it is the becoming. You have to become it's, not just talking. Now, forget your questions for the time being. Better get your Religion, alright? Now, one thing is that you have to just take out your shoes or Chapas, anything because this Mother Earth is of great help. She sucks in all of our problems. Put both the feet apart from each other. You will know everything about Sahaja Yoga. Why I said, to put your feet apart from each other. Everything you will know very clearly, but they should touch the Mother Earth. You have to just be comfortable. And all of you should be seated. Before I start, I have to request that those who want their Realization only I can give them. It cannot be forced because Kundalini is a pure desire is a pure desire. Not impure desire as we have. Whatever desired we have we had today one, then we want to have something else that's, the principle of economics. But this is a pure desire and for this pure desire, you should be determined to get it. Is your own character. Your own understanding only will work it out. Now, I would request you all to sit comfortably with both feet like this very comfortably. And put both your hands, towards Me, like this. Now what I find that some of you feel guilty. It's nonsense. If you feel guilty, then this centre here catches on the left-hand side and the Kundalini doesn't move. So if you have done anything wrong, I agree. So it's finished. That's the past. You don't have to worry about that at this moment, please. You have to know that you are not guilty at all for anything, so please forgive yourself. Please forgive yourself. Now the second thing is that we have to forgive also others. Now, some people say it's, difficult to forgive, Mother, having, what do you do? Whether you forgive or you don't forgive, you don't do anything what do you do? Nothing. But by not forgiving, you torture yourself. So the best thing is to forgive all of them. Forgive everybody, who was harmed you, who has troubled you, has made you unhappy, has hurt you. Forgive, don't also think about them. It's also useless. By forgiving, you don't know what will happen. Absolutely, you will feel peaceful with yourself. Just forgive everyone. This nobleness you should accept today that you forgive everyone just forgive. Now, please put your hands towards Me. Like this. Comfortably. Now you can put your right hand towards Me and feel with the left hand on top of your fontanelle bone area little higher, if there is any cool or a hot breeze, like vibrations, are coming out of your own head. On your ... you can feel it. You move your hand up and down and see for yourself if you are feeling, please remove your caps If you have, please. It is better to remove.

Now, please see. You must have respect for yourself, should not denounce yourself and you should also forgive everyone. That's, very important. Now put the left hand towards Me and put the right hand on top of your fontanelle bone area and bend your head, just bend your head, and see for yourself if there's a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your own fontanelle bone area. This is the actualization of the baptism. You may call it. Once more, put your right hand towards Me. And see with your left hand if there is a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your fontanelle bone area, please keep your head bendy. Now. If it is hot means you have not forgiven yourself, or you have not forgiven others. So again, please forgive. Please forgive yourself and forgive others. That's a very great ascent and help. Now see for yourself. If there's a cool or a hot breeze coming on your fingertips or on your palms. Please forgive, forgive. Forgive yourself and forgive others. Very important, because of this centre here, when the crossing of the optic ... it get obstructed if you have not forgiven, so please forgive because its a myth not to forgive. So please forgive. I would say all those who have felt the cool breeze in their hands or hot breeze on their fingertips or on their palm or out of their fontanelle bone area, hot or cool breeze, please raise your hands. Mostly all of you've got it. Mostly. May God bless you. May God bless you. May God bless you all. In such a short time you have got it. That means really we have got very wonderful people this time from Los Angeles. Those who are truly sickles or real seekers may god bless you for that. Now you must respect your realization, and I hope you'll grow into it. You'll try to grow and become masters. Hardly it will take even one month maybe to become the masters. Why not do it? Alright? May God bless you.
