I bow to all the seekers of Truth.

At the very outset, we have to know that truth is what it is.

We cannot change it,

because it is and it will be.

It is eternal.

The unfortunate part is, that we cannot see the truth at this human awareness.

So we have to evolve more.

If human beings knew the absolute truth, there would be no problems.

Everybody would have known the same.

No arguments, no quarrels, no wars.

But we do not know the absolute truth.

Unless and until we know the absolute truth, we cannot understand the problems of this world.

All problems of the world are mostly because of human beings

and all the problems of human beings are because these subtle centres are in trouble.

All the physical, mental, emotional and spiritual problems are there

because these chakras are not looked after.

So what is the truth?

The truth is that you are not this body, this mind, emotions, ego, conditionings,

but you are the pure spirit.

Which you have to become.

Another truth is that there is an all-pervading divine power of love.

You see these flowers, beautiful flowers.

Actually, it's a miracle,

that the seed has become a beautiful flower with help of The Mother Earth.

Who runs our heart?

We just don't see. We take it for granted.

It is the all-pervading divine power, which is very subtle.

The evolutionary process, which is a living process,

has to connect you to the all-pervading power.

This is the real yoga, it's the spiritual yoga.

This union is also called - the second birth.

It's not that you can say that you are twice-born [inaudible]

It is a higher state.

This is enlightenment.

This enlightenment has been talked about in all the scriptures.

Christ has said: „You have to be born again"

In Koran, it is also said about the enlightenment.

All the Indian scriptures also talk about it.

When You are reading about Buddha, there is nothing but talk of enlightenment.

But they have done something overboard or they have lost the way.

They are not seeking enlightenment at all.

They are seeking money, power, but not the enlightenment.

First, we have got fundamentalism and all kind of problems in the name of God,

For now, we have to understand, that within us is the subtle mechanism,

which is made like this, which helps with our enlightenment

and it's very easy to get your self-realisation.

12.59

This power which is like a connection is in the sacrum bone.

It is your own power. It is your own power.

It is your own evolutionary process.

You can't pay for it, because God doesn't understand money.

How much did you pay for these flowers?

In the same way, you don't have to put in any effort for this evolutionary process.

It is sahaj. Spontaneous. Saha - means „with", „ja" - means born.

Born with you is the right, to get this union, this yoga.

Unless and until this instrument is connected to the mains, it has no meaning.

In the same way, if we are not connected to the all-pervading power, we have no identity,

we have no meaning.

This happening as I told you ...is responsible for [inaudible]

physical, emotional, spiritual wellbeing,

also it gives you lots of other blessings.

One of them is that you develop a new dimension in your awareness,

where you can stand in your present.

You are all the time running in the past or in the future,

but it is [inaudible] to stand in reality.

Secondly, you feel this all-pervading power on your fingertips for the first time.

This is the resurrection time.

This is the last judgment, that's why we have such a population growth.

So many people are born in these modern times because they want to get their self-realisation.

This is the only way you can enter into the kingdom of God.

In Sahaja Yoga nothing is [inaudible]

Nothing is under [inaudible] no secrets.

Everyone knows everything.

There you can reach the state of thoughtless awareness,

by which we become a peaceful personality.

You become spontaneously righteous, nobody has to tell you:

„ Don't do this, don't do that.”

This happens in the light of your Spirit.

Secondly, you can feel your centres on your fingertips and the centres of others,

thus you become collectively conscious.

The Self is the source of absolute truth.

It is the source of enlightenment.

Your attention is so enlightened that you become innocent.

There is no greed and lust in your eyes. You become pure.

Apart from this, you jump in the ocean of love.

I'm very happy to tell you that Sahaja Yoga has made great progress in Russia.

The Russians don't like fundamentalism.

So we have thousands and thousands of people in Russia.

One day that country will be a very rich and a very powerful country in the realm of God.

Even the priests come to take realisation.

We have also a very big combination of Sahaja Yogis who meditate

in Bulgaria and also Romania, in thousands,

also in Hungary.

Of course in the western countries it is quite a lot. Especially in India.

In all these places people are really enjoying their self-realisation, their self-knowledge.

I'm sorry to say that Poland is not that good.

I'm surprised because first time when I came to Poland I felt the people are very courageous.

...I came with my husband, [inaudible] they have prepared, the whole of Warsaw...

and I felt they really will be the persons who will be resurrected very fast,

but surprisingly, I don't know why, in Poland, they are very conditioned by the Catholic Church.

22.41

What Christ have said is to seek the truth and to find your Sprit.

Christ is very important incarnation for Sahaja Yoga,

but one has to understand, that He came for our resurrection, not for crucifixion.

He has suffered for us, we don't have to suffer anymore.

God Almighty is the Father, who is love

and how would He ask you to suffer?

For me, it is not possible.

Which father would like for the son to suffer?

So all these theories are not correct and not logical.

The first conditioning that people get is that you feel guilty,

by feeling guilty this centre on the left catches very bad.

Since I've come to Poland I'm feeling this pain here all the time.

When this centre catches then you develop diseases like angina, tonsillitis.

And all your organs become lethargic.

Why to feel guilt? It is difficult.

If you have done anything wrong, then you should face it, that's all.

But please do not put it as guilt here all the time and make yourself sick.

Another thing I noticed, is that you are taking to American life which is very dangerous.

As communism has failed, democracy has failed completely there.

There is no ethics. There is no morality.

The people are so violent that you can't even wear a wedding ring.

Even small children of 12 years carry guns to [bugger???] Drugs

AIDS are eating them off,

apart from that, 55% of people are expected to become schizophrenic.

In their ego, they've become so stupid and idiotic,

that they cannot listen, finished.

And the life is so difficult there.

Also they have committed lots of sins of killing so many Red Indians.

Red Indians were killed by them [inaudible] it's a very big thing/sin [ ???]

In the area where they are having floods now, its called as the Red Neck India[???]

These Americans in that area where racist and they used to kill all the black people

and throw them into rivers.

Very hot-tempered and aggressive, very simple.

28.33

So now there used to be a Mississipi? river all is flooded

and all their houses everything ???

for which they have killed, young people??

So one has to understand that from distance you see all democratic countries are very happy,

but it is not so up close

There are people, millions and millions, who are out of job

and the clothes that are coming here, are actually junk,

which they cannot sell in their own country.

They are very superficial people.

So please, keep to your Polish life.

Keep your Polish ways,

which is much more older,

as American culture is only 200 years old,

so you are much better off.

Keep [???....] to your culture, to your production here and not to take this junk things.

30.37

It is important for spirituality, that you could take to deeper interest

and not too superficial.

So now we are going to have a session of meditation, in which you will get your enlightenment.

It should hardly take 10 to 15 minutes.

Once you get your realisation, you can give realisation to others

and [inaudible]

and you become divine, that's what it is.

Of course, those who really want it can leave ???

It cannot be forced on anyone.

So that you get ultimate freedom.

Ideally, the people who don't want to get their self-realisation would leave the house

and not to disturb others.

For about 10 -15 minutes it will take

and in that, you have to be peaceful.

Everybody should be seated, please.

Before I start, I will tell you there are three conditions for your self-realisation.

The first one is, that you are not to feel guilty at all.

Forget the past, past is finished

and the future doesn't exist.

What exists as reality is the present,

so please forget the past.

The another condition is that you need to forgive everyone.

You don't have to think whom you have to forgive.

You should not think about it, it's just a headache,

but try to understand whether you forgive or don't forgive, you don't do anything.

It's just a myth that you carry on,

but if you don't forgive, then you play into the wrong hands

and you suffer,

while the person who has hurt you doesn't suffer.

So we forgive.

Forgive everyone without thinking about individuals.

It will help you very much, you will feel much lighter.

And the third condition is, that you must feel absolutely confident

that you will all get your self-realisation.

You should not have any complexes about yourself.

You should not doubt yourself,

because the time has come for you to get your realisation immediately.

These are the three conditions.

Is it possible for you to take off your shoes?

Because The Mother Earth helps us a lot to absorb.

To absorb the negativity,

also She absorbs many problems.

I told you this is not meant for idiots, nor for arrogants,

but it's meant for truthful seekers of Truth.

Please put both your feet apart from each other,

not for the people who sit on the ground at all.

37.50

There are two powers left and right.

The left is the power of desire, the right is the power of action

and this Kundalini rises through the central path

and pierces through your fontanel bone area.

This is the actualisation of baptism.

Have faith in yourself, don't doubt in yourself at all.

You can put your hands like this, especially your left hand like this,

indicating symbolically that you want to have self-realisation.

On your lap, don't forget it.

You be comfortable

You don't have to go to the Himalayas, standing on Your head.

With the right hand, you have to nourish your centres.

Somebody will show you how to nourish your centres.

We have people here from Germany, from Czechoslovakia

from Italy, from England

[indistinct]

First, you have to put your hand on the heart where your spirit resides.

You should get out (Shri Mataji addresses someone in the audience)

Alright

Then we put our ..

We work only on the left-hand side.

Put your right hand now, on the uppermost part of your abdomen, on the left-hand side.

If you become your spirit, then you become your own master,

which is created by great prophets within us themselves.

Now, we take our right hand in the lower part of our abdomen,

on the left-hand side.

Now, this is the centre of pure knowledge.

Later you can understand how it works.

It is pure divine knowledge.

Now raise your right hand to the upper part of your abdomen.

Why don't you do it (Shri Mataji addresses someone in the audience)

This lady

Put your left hand also.

Now, raise it to your heart

To your heart, please, why don't you do it?

Doesn't she understand Polish?

If you don't want to do it then go.

Now, raise your right hand in the corner of your neck.

This way, take it from the front, not from the back, here.

I already told you what happens, when this centre catches.

When you feel guilty, you catch at this centre.

Turn your face to the right.

Now, take your right hand on top of your forehead and bend forward.

At this centre, you can forgive everyone,

without thinking about any individual, in general.

Then take your hand at the back of your head.

Now, here, for your own satisfaction ask forgiveness from the divine power

44.17

Push back Your head.

For the last centre, just press your palm

and put the centre of your palm on top of your fontanelle bone area,

and please put down your head.

Now, the most important is [inaudible]

Now move your scalp seven times, clockwise, very slowly.

That's all we have to do.

Now, you have to now close your eyes,

before that please put both your feet apart on the floor.

Now put your left hand towards me like this.

You may also remove your spectacles

and open your eyes when I tell you.

Please put your right hand on the heart.

Now, here you have to ask Me a very fundamental question

three times in your heart

46.18

Please, say in your heart, you may call me Mother or Shri Mataji

So please say three times: „Mother, am I the Spirit?”

I assure you, when you become the Spirit you also become the master.

Please place your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen

and press it hard.

Here, we have to ask another fundamental question about yourself:

„Mother, am I my own master?”

I told you that I respect your freedom, and I cannot force your divine knowledge on You.

Now please put your right hand on the lower abdomen,

on the left-hand side and press it with your fingers.

Here you have to say six times, because this centre has got six petals:

„Mother, please give me your divine knowledge”

„Mother, give me ..your ..divine knowledge”

As soon as you are the pure divine knowledge, the Kundalini starts rising.

So we have to nourish the upper centres with our self-confidence.

Please take your right hand to the upper portion of your abdomen,

on the left-hand side, and here you have to say self-confident ten times:

„ Mother, I am my own master”

I have to tell you that you are not this body, this mind, these conditionings, this ego

but you are the pure Spirit.

Raise your right hand, on your heart, and with full confidence say twelve times:

„Mother, I am the pure Spirit”

This all-pervading power is the ocean of love and compassion.

It is the ocean of blessings and joy,

but above all, it is the ocean of forgiveness,

and whatever mistakes you might have committed in the past,

completely dissolve in this ocean of forgiveness.

Raise your right hand in the corner of your left shoulder [inaudible]

and here you have to say with full confidence sixteen times,

with full confidence:

„Mother, I am not guilty at all”

53.16

Now, I have already told you, that whether you forgive or don't forgive

you don't do anything,

but if you don't forgive, then you play into the wrong hands.

So, you have to forgive everyone, in general.

So raise your hand put it across and bend down your head.

Here you have to say from your heart [inaudible]

„Mother, I forgive everybody”

Now, without feeling guilty, without [inaudible] just for your own satisfaction,

you have to ask forgiveness

from the Divine Power.

Now, raise your hand on the backside of your head.

Here you have to say:

„Oh, Divine Power if I have done any mistakes, knowingly or unknowingly,

please forgive me”

Please say this from your heart,

not how many times.

Now, for the last chakra, you have to place your palm fully

and put it on top of the fontanelle bone area.

It was a soft bone in your childhood.

Please put down your head.

Now push back your fingers

Please push back your fingers.

Here again, I cannot force self-realisation on you.

You have to ask seven times:

„Mother, please give me self-realisation”

moving your scalp seven times, clockwise, slowly.

[Mother is blowing into the mic]

Takedown your hand.

Wear your glasses and open your eyes.

Now put both hands towards me like this and don't think.

Now please put the right hand like this

and bend your head [inaudible]

Please don't put the hand on top of your head.

There may be a cool or hot breeze coming out of your head.

Bend your head, bend it.

Now with the right hand and left hand towards me [inaudible]

Now, please put like that.

If it is hot, that means you have not forgiven.

Now forgive.

Don't put it on top.

Bend your head.

Don't put it on top, don't touch your head.

Keep it away.

Alright.

Some people get it far, some people get it close.

Now, we can put both hands towards the sky like this

and ask the question. Any one of these questions:

„Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?”

or „Mother, is this the all-pervading power of Divine Love?"

or „Mother, is this the Paramchaitaya?”

Any one of these questions you can ask three times.

Now, please put down your hands.

All those who have felt cool or hot breeze out of their heads,

on their fingertips or on their hands, please raise both your hands.

Both hands.

All of you got it.

[inaudible]

One thing you have to know, it is not an individual happening.

It is a collective happening

Now the seed has sprouted.

You will feel very joyous.

Very happy.

You will feel this cool from your hands.

You might get cured,

but the main thing is, you have to grow within.

You have to come to our centre, where you can get complete knowledge.

Within one month you can become an expert.

When you can give realisation to others,

you can cure people and you can be in complete peace with others.

I wish to see you grow like big trees.

You can do it.

We have a centre here, which you can attend and understand what is inside me.

You can get your enlightenment

and enjoy yourself.

May God bless you
