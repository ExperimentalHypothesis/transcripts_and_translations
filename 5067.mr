English Transcript

It is not proper, but He was not just a mere king, you see He was a Devi bhakta and an ansha avtara and His Mother was also an ansha avtara. What is the sign of an ansha avtara is that they have extra powers over themselves and over others, and they have no temptations, no mistakes.

[Shri Mataji speaks in Marathi to the sound technicians about the sound system problem.]

So, first of all we should know that Shivaji himself was a divine person in the sense that He had no defects in him. He was a detached personality. I do not want to tell you the whole history about him, but his character if you study you will be amazed how detached He was. He was not found of women. He never hankered after them and on the contrary respected women very much. There is a story that once He was presented with the daughter-in-law of a great nawab because the people used to do, I do not know what you call those tactics where you attack the people hiding from behind.

[Shri Mataji is speaking with the sound technicians and the Sahaja Yogis present there about failure of the sound system due to load shedding, load shedding is a problem the people of this place face every Tuesday. Shri Mataji asks the Sahaja Yogis present there to try to listen to Her from their Sahasrara, pay attention to Her and they will be able to listen Her.]

So, this great king Shivaji was a man without any temptation for women and once He was presented with a very beautiful lady who was the daughter-in-law of a big nawab, because they looted lot of money and lot of precious things and this lady as well when her caravan was passing through some passage in the mountains. So Shivaji looked at her. He asked her to remover her veil because she was a Muslim lady and then looking at her He said that if my mother was as beautiful as you are, I would have been equally beautiful, is the best way to say you are my sister. He himself had to marry four times because of certain problems of political nature where He had to marry four women, but He married them, because He had to marry and all the four wives were his wives and no other women came into his head. This is such a tremendous character. This is first sign of a personality who is really mature, who has no attention towards another women, which is very common in Maharasthra it is not difficult for them they do not understand what I am talking about. This is one of the things one has to understand how respectful He was to other women. That He gave away all her things, all her money, all her jewelry, all that was looted of that nawab also, all the arms everything, and sent back all the people to the nawab, because if there is a lady she is the shakti, she is traveling so nobody has business to trouble her. This was his respect for women who belonged actually to another party. He had so many qualities that it is impossible to describe on that but absolutely honest, absolutely honest He was and He lived like a saint. He did not care for comfort. If you go and see his things that the had you will be amazed, He could sleep on the stones, but for his kingship He had to wear all the ornaments, all the dresses which He used to wear. If you go in Bombay museum you will see chilkhat we call it a cover made out of iron mesh. He used to wear that, it is so heavy that you cannot lift it, but He had to wear it and He used to fight his wars wearing that, but like all other kings you see in the west He did not have weaknesses, He had no habits, extremely honest, Spartan in temperament, and absolute ideal king He was, an absolute ideal king. He talked to everyone on the same level, treated everybody with respect, never showed off that he was a king, but He kept his dignity all the time and when it was needed to be corrected with all courage He corrected people, He did not care for cheap popularity either. Such a man was a blessing to Maharashtra because He is such an ideal for us and for people to follow and His mother was a great lady who brought him out of the clutches of the Mughal people who tried to convert forcibly Hindus to Islam. Like this Aurangzeb he used to hate music, and he would kill, very right sided fellow, every year the brahmins so many brahmins that the thread they used to weigh according to his body weight. So you can imagine what a cruel man he was. He was like Hitler only, but he was also very honest in the sense he used to make his own caps and sell them and live on that money. He was very right sided who was honest as far as the money was concerned, the government money was concerned, but he was so fanatically imprisoned in his own ideas about God that he had become just like a rakshasha. To face him was very difficult was very difficult in those days, he was a terror. Nobody could face Hitler from inside but Shivaji managed it, and he did it so well.

So Satara is a place where he established his first kingdom. This is the capital of Maharashtra, Satara, that is why it is a very important place. Secondly, after Shivaji, or when Shivaji was the king looking after the whole worldly affairs, his own son fell into a bad company of a fellow who came from Uttar Pradesh called Kabji Kalusha who started drinking and doing all wrong things that should not be done. He was imprisoned, but even then he was a very-very lost case, but a good hearted fellow that is why this Maharasthra was divided into two and his younger brother had to form another kingdom or another part of the capital was in Kohlapur where I think you have seen Sahu Maharaja's statue there. So he was a very dharmic fellow, very good person and he looked after that part very well. So, Kohlapur started another capital, but what I am trying to say that when negativity starts crawling into something great, then it starts getting divided and it is now a very common character they say of Marathas that they indulge in Bhau Bandki, always form groups. I find it even happening in Sahaja Yoga. I went to Rahuri, I felt that in Rahuri also there is a kind of Bhau Bandki working out. This is character of Marathas and they have to be very-very careful about it. One of them is Bhau Bandki that they form a group suddenly and separate themselves from one another and start fighting each other, it is sort of a coagulation that takes place in their temperaments. One must understand that unless and until absolutely we are united we cannot do Sahaja Yoga. So this kind of separation is a very wrong thing which should be avoided out and out and one thing I want to tell all the Maharashtrians that they have to be careful on this point is Bhau Bandki. This comes out of jealousy out of thirst for power, for not accepting somebody as the leader, trying to find faults all the time. If the leader is wrong also it can happen. If the leader goes wrong if he is not a person who can carry on well with others and something it can happen. So it is quite a mutual thing that works out but as a result of the whole thing is that it starts getting bifurcated and that is how we lost the kingdom of Maharasthra ultimately. So it's a very good example of understanding how Shivaji worked hard fought Aurangzeb, established his kingdom and how it was lost in second generation itself.

[Shri Mataji addresses in Marathi about Shivaji, that how he established His capital in Satara, that we should try imbibe his character. His utmost quality was that he did not have any dosha (wrong). He did not have any habits. He never had the ego that he was the king, he used to eat with his people, talk to them. Shivaji was a Ansha Avtara, he was devoted to his mother, never spoke in front of her or against he, he was not proud of being a king. She also addresses about Bhau Bandki which she says is a thing the Maharashtrians should be careful of. Mother says that one should work for others, and not think about only oneself. One should not find faults in others, first he should find faults within himself. Love for others is most important in Sahaja Yoga. Nothing is impossible for a Sahaja Yogi who has has established self realization, who meditates regularly, and participates in the collective meditation.]

Translation from Marathi

I was telling about Shivaji Maharaj as he had established his capital at Satara. We should also take the qualities he had.The special  quality that he had was that he had no fault in him like the faults our people  have, like someone  is habitual  to something, someone  is addicted  to something, someone runs like mad behind  a person. By this it proves that he was part incarnation. As he was ansh avtara (part incarnation ) he had no bad habits  like  drinking means noone  needed to tell him, He was simply not like that. Also he had extremely sweet nature. His temperament was extremely sweet. He was extremely sweet natured and completely surrendered to his mother. He never ever spoke ill of anyone, he never shouted on anyone or got angry on anyone. These two qualities are very difficult to find. When a person has so many blessings of mother and not only this, there comes special importance to his boons as he was also king but even then there was extreme sweetness in his nature. He had no airs about himself that I am a king and these all are very poor people how can i sit with them. He took food with them. He enjoyed eating onion with bhakar ( Maharashtrian bread made with millets) with them. He travelled night and day on horse. He slept anywhere at night, Doing anything. In this way he spent his life. He had an extremely gruelling and hard working life and after that when there was a quarrel  between  Sambhaji Maharaj and Shahuji Maharaj   ( his two sons)  the only reason of it being  nepotism. Nepotism is in nature of us Maharashtrians. It is very deep conditioning inside us. Without that we can't bear. Means we are not ready to bear that we have nepotism in us. We are not ready to accept this but nepotism is deep rooted in us. So we should keep this in mind. I observe nepotism in Sahaja yoga also where ever I go. This is a very awful quality of Maharashtrians. Due to this Nepotism we lost one Kingdom and now we should not loose Kingdom of god. Those people who are in the vocation of god, they should all stick together.  Noone should break away. Noone should speak ill to others. Shivaji maharaj's customs were not like this. He gave great importance to anyone who had done a work. We know after the victory of Sinhagadh he said" Gadh milala pan Sinha gela" (though we won a fort, but I lost a lion). How big a thing it is that, though I won a fort my lion is gone? By his nature we should also learn that in Sahaja yoga also it is necessary to give importance to others.

One should not continue giving importance to himself like harping praise on himself that we are special, we are different etc. Many people think that they are educated. In Sahaja yoga some people are financially sound and educated so they don't mix with people of rural background.  This is not right. ‘They are separate from us. They should live separately and we should stay apart from them’. If this feeling comes then you have yet not understood Sahaja yoga. Yoga doesn't have a caste or creed or high Class/low class, even Sahaja yogi should not differentiate on basis of rich and poor. Then only you will be a yogi. So identification of a yogi is that we all are one, we are children of one mother, there is no difference in us and there should be complete equity in us. If we want to change our country then like Shivaji we have example in front of us and have seen that firstly we should not have any fault in ourselves. One who has defects in himself, how can he preach to others?  Secondly those who were his followers, they had immense faith in him. If you are always fighting leaders and finding faults in them then that also is a mistake.  If both the combinations are there then only nepotism does not happen and if both combinations are not made then Nepotism thrives. Speaking inconsiderately is extremely wrong. Likewise not respecting your leaders, humiliating  him, criticizing him, giving him a lesson is more wrong than that. So if these two things we are able to manage then Nepotism will finish in our country.  It should not be there. It should go completely, from roots it should go.

It will never go by looking at mistakes of others; we should look for faults within ourselves. I am speaking all this in Satara as in Satara only Swarajya was established and in Sarata only disintegration of Swarajya started. So both things must be kept in mind -we should not have anarchic behaviour within us. This is a work of love and we should connect love only. Rest all other thoughts and this what people do. Some people are intellectuals, so on the base of their mind they get separated from everyone. We should live on the base of love only. Love is the food of Sahaja yoga. How much did we love others? Instead of finding faults in others how much did we give others, we need to see this. So we should use both things carefully. Now that this project is started in Satara I am extremely happy and yesterday I felt very nice as lot of seekers were there and many people got their realization. In Sahaja yoga lot of grand work is to be done and many will achieve great heights. Those sitting here will be leaders tomorrow. It was very pleasing to me. But we should keep in mind whatever mistakes were made earlier in politics, same mistakes we should not make in kingdom of God. We should not do it there. There are very strict and biding rules of Kingdom of God. Whoever goes against the rules is castigated immediately. So we should be careful, we need to be extremely careful. His blessings are eternal, forgiveness is also eternal but it is upto a limit. After that his hand lands with force. Then nothing will be as per you. Therefore we should keep in mind that now we are entering into the Kingdom of God so we should keep this wisdom that we should not bring the wretched politics here. These wretched things should not surface. We are in Kingdom of love, tied to each other with the knots of love, we are the children of a single mother so no infighting. The power we need to exert should be on ourselves. This place is not for governing others. This place is to have mastery on yourself, this needs to be understood. Once you get mastery on yourself the first thing it will show in is your vibrations. How are your vibrations, Based on this I know what is going on inside you, how is it going and where it is going haywire. So please do not practice Nepotism or form any groups and if they are formed then break them.

Mataji has told don’t form any groups, don’t speak against anyone, don’t speak ill of anyone .Don’t form groups, everyone should live congenially. When I came to Satara this thought came to me that I should apprise this to everyone & give this realization because Sahaja yoga is easily attained & in this the first thing one gets is Authority & power. & in that authority one tends to suppress others or people say ‘Why this person does so much?’ This also is wrong. When one suppresses people think who he to do this is. So in Sahaja yoga one should keep in mind Shri Mataji has allocated each person to his place and She keeps relation with everyone. Their relation is due to that one appointment. Like in our mind there is one brain and by brain only we keep whole body in sync. Similarly it needs to be done in Sahaja yoga. Then if a fault comes in that man it comes in my attention and I correct him immediately but if you find faults in him you ruin everything. Isn’t it so! Have you realized this point? The one person who is the leader you should accept him & I will keep an eye on him. If he makes mistakes I will understand. I understand everything of everyone. I don’t tell or say it doesn’t mean I do not know. I know about everyone. So the one person we have appointed as leader, he must be accepted. Mataji has appointed him & we have faith in Mataji. You may be better educated, you may be having more money or whatever, even then don’t do like that. If there is a leader, till the time I think it is right for you people, let him be. In future if he makes a mistake I will remove him. I understand everything! If you keep this in mind Sahaja yoga will grow. Because in Sahaja yoga there is no institution, you need not give any money & there is no membership, so how will people be bonded? Bond of love. Everything is bonded in love. Bond everyone by love. Secondly power of love comes from ShriMataji so whoever she has authorized, accept him. Later if I see faults in that person then I will throw him out. So you should keep complete faith in me for that matter. Also what kind of character to build & how we should behave? To learnt this you have me in front of you. Ok if you think we cannot be like Mataji, then there is Shivaji Maharaj. We have a lot of people like this in us. Nothing is difficult for people who have got their realization in Sahaja yoga, nothing is difficult. Life is changed completely. Look at these people (foreigners). How much they have changed! They couldnot even sit on earth for five minutes. They took great efforts to learn to sit on earth. So we should properly meditate.

If in the evening before going to sleep you do meditation for 15-20 minutes, even then the state improves. And in the morning before going outside or after taking a bath in the morning even if we do pooja of photo for five minutes, it is enough. But everyone should meet every week. If this doesn't happen then Sahaja yoga does not settle in you. Everyone should meet once a week as this is collective consciousness. If you say 'Mataji we kept a photo of you at home, we do pooja of you even then we had this trouble ' then you should know my attention is not there. I told you yesterday only, like when we whip buttermilk to make butter then whatever sticks to the big lump we take that only, rest all is thrown away. Similarly only people who stick to collectivity come to me, rest all are not in my attention. So we must come to a place where 10 people gather, we should talk to everyone, discuss But we should not do groupism. Talk should be less and meditation should me more ,then everything is all right. But if there is groupism then ' I correct you, I fix you, I put you in place '. All this starts means then you are gone case.

After going there everyone should meditate, sing bhajans and if there are any queries then sort them out But starting a quarrel sitting there ...should not be started. Instead whatever is to be gained in Sahaja yoga focus on its growth in us. How much we have grown in Sahaja yoga , where we have reached...

Now I feel that slowly in Maharashtra Sahaja yoga will establish but for future I am worried that the hard work than I have done should not go to waste. The responsibility of whole world is on you, you should keep this in mind. Responsibility of whole world is on Maharashtrians, this should be kept in mind. Then if you sink, which is also possible for you, so you shouldn't do like that. Whatever faults are in us they have to be thrown out. In our nature we should add sweetness, speak with love and behave with equity with everyone. If it comes in behaviour (outside) it will also come inside as in you outside and inside all have become same. Whatever you will do outside, it will manifest inside, whatever you will do inside, that will come outside because in you outside and inside have become one. It normally does not happen but now this relation has been established in you. Like if this mike becomes defective outside then sound doesn't come or if it becomes defective inside even then sound does not come. Both things should be in order. Many people say ' Mataji we do meditation, our vibrations are ok' but still it should manifest outside also otherwise slowly whatever is inside will also finish away. Therefore man should be same both outside and inside and he should look radiant. But in that radiance there should not be any kind of scotching. The glow should not be scorching but extremely pleasant and it should be cool like moon.

Next time when I will come then there will be more people and taking all together we will do a pooja. But this time I will not come, I will come next year. This year probably I will stay here for an night, then we will see, if possible do something.

(Shri Mataji bows to everyone.)
