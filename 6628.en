"Sincerity is the key of your success", Sahasrara Puja, Dollis Hill ashram, London (England), 5 May 1980.

We can say, in 1970, 5th May, [for the] first time, the collective Spirit of God opened out.

So far the blessings of God came to human beings individually as grace. And they received their Self-realisation individually, one by one. And the method for individual realisation was just the opposite of the collective. First they had to establish their dharma, cleanse themselves fully, desiring all the time for their salvation, putting their attention to their salvation, as you call it Ishwara Pranidhan (desire for God), thinking of God, asking for His grace and acting in a scrupulous, dharmic ways to keep themselves pure. They had to control their mind, control their desires, control their action in such a manner that they absolutely kept to the centre path. And when they could get through all that testing and immunity, and when they deserved [it], then only the grace of Mother gave them realisation.

This pattern was on for some time. These few people who got realisation did lots of wonderful things to prepare for Sahaj Yog. They were in every field of life, but very few and unique. For example, in India and in many other places in ancient times, they discovered the unique gifts of the Mother Earth; what you call as the swayambhus - created by themselves. These stones or stone images, which were thrown out by the Mother Earth, were discovered by these saints. They put shrines there, they worshipped them and, by worshipping, they made these images vibrate - more of vibrations and vibrate that area. All over the world there are such stones, but only the saints could discover them.

Then they established the importance of virtue in life: how virtue can give you health, wealth and prosperity which is glorifying and not which is degrading or which is destructive. They established schools and universities, specially in India. And today, even today, in India, the families which belong to one university carry the name of that university as their gotras. And even today the families belonging to one (the same) gotra cannot marry. They prepared young children, educated them, in such a manner that they led a very dharmic life, enjoyed their married life fully and then they matured in such a manner that they got their realisation and lived a life of complete enjoyment. Thus they distracted the attention of people which was outside, to inner, deeper values, by their own example, by their own behaviour, by their own style of enjoyment, by leading a very cheerful and a happy life. All this permeated a kind of confidence in God, religion, and a very good, balanced life. They have really done a great job of first building the scaffoldings of the huge, great building of Sahaja Yoga which is going to come now. They are just like nuts and bolts in our whole working. Their desire to establish dharma was so great that complete Divine force of Mahakali was working through them. Then they put it to the action with such understanding and such wisdom. Great scriptures were written by them and for many years, thousands of years, they were the guiding lines (guidelines) for people.

Only in the modern times, if you say about a thousand years or so, people started doubting them. Before that people used to doubt themselves. They used to doubt that, "We are not yet capable. We are not good enough. We cannot do it better, but they are perfect. Whatever they have said is all right." There was no doubting about the incarnations or about these saints, what they said. But the doubting was about themselves that, "How is it that this is the good path, we know, this is the real path, we know; still we are going in the wrong direction?"

If you read the poems of those days, it's all the time [expressing] that, "Why, despite the desire to be good, to be upright, to be righteous, why am I roaming into wrong paths and wilderness?" The writers in those days always showed that a good righteous man was rewarded by God's blessings, but all this started toppling down with the ego developing and the super-ego challenging. Confusion started coming into the minds of people and they started doubting those great realised souls instead of doubting themselves. Because they could not reach anywhere near these great saints, some of them were influenced by many satanic forces around and played into their hands and started doubting those realised people and all these great scriptures.

So, [on] the one side we have the doubting people, the another side the fanatics. Those who tried to adhere more and more to the teachings had to become fanatics, so they became fanatics. And those who started doubting also could not show any benefits of doubting, could not convince the fanatics that they were wrong. So on one side we had fanatics and another side the doubting people - it's like standing between the two stools - the real religion in man collapsed. There cannot be a new religion. Religion is a continuous living process within us which is our sustenance. It's like a ladder on which we climb, leaving one by one, step by step, but not leaving the ladder. All others are required. So the ultimate had to be established because of these two types of emergence, one doubting, another fanatics. Both had not known God, both had not achieved Reality, and they criticised each other because both of them did not know what Truth was.

I took my birth at a point where these confusions had started showing its results even on the physical plane. All imbalances of life react - physically, mentally, emotionally, also spiritually. When I started looking around I was amazed how ignorance had made people naïve, like a cloud of ignorance which came on them. Formerly people had this much understanding, this much sensitivity to know what is right and what is wrong. Even if they were wrong they knew that wrong was wrong and right was right. But in this [world's] confused state I was born, and I knew I was to open the Sahasrara. So I started my work after my first shocks. I decided not to talk about it to anyone and lead a very, very normal life of a very ordinary person, not to be very striking. Because, like Christ when He was born, a star came up. That's how the king Herod came to know about Him, and his forces worked and you know the story what happened. If you are born with any striking signs the negativity immediately finds you out. As it is it found me out and just after the 15th day of my birth there was a very big accident as you know.

I had to really, really work, very, very, very hard to enter into your being to find out the different permutations and combination. First of all I had to find out your basic problems, what are your basic problems are. Once you handle the basics then you can handle the permutations and combinations. After finding the basic problems I started finding out your permutations and combinations and I was amazed how human beings were placed to their outside world and how they reacted to their outside world. And I identified that these permutations and combinations which formed within themselves were also capped by their other identifications, like the society in which they were born, like the nation in which they were born, like the ideas that were there. All these things became much more important than the Original Being, which is Universal, within you. And every individual had taken a very odd, funny, awkward type of a shape which I didn't know how to reduce and how to bring it to proper growth level by which they start their growth.

It was a very, very hard work and the nights after nights I used to work, while leading a very, very ordinary life of a very normal person. I used to deliberately behave like a very simple ordinary student and show all my ignorance about things, but sometimes, you know, Truth has an awkward habit of slipping out and it used to show itself.

Then this working started and one of the biggest major problems of human beings I found was the family life and that's why I married. I wanted to study what are the problems of family life. And then I started facing these problems as if they were my own and started understanding why people behave in this manner and that manner. Because these connections are to be done, of course by you, but much more by the Divine Force and if I could know what are your problems I would be able to act.

Then other problems like political, economic and all these problems also I tried to study because they became so important for human beings, which are of absolutely artificial value, but they did. So I had to see to that, what makes them do this and what makes them do that. Sort of a Human Behaviour Science I had to study for years. And then as you start unfolding or you can say unentangling or disentangling, or taking out the knots of a bundle, you reach a point where all the knots are opened out and one knot is still left, you see, which is to be opened out. And that was done on the 5th of May 1970. And once that had [been] done, the collective phenomena started working. And the greatest collective phenomena was that the Shri Chakra being on this Earth, could be felt through your fingers. This was never before so, nobody felt the fingers enlightened, nobody felt the vibrations on the fingers as such, but they felt it within themselves because the rising of the Kundalini and everything and the way they developed themselves inside, they were more concerned about one individual. They developed their inner being much more than their collective being.

But now because the Sahasrara of the Universe was opened out, everybody started feeling the vibrations around them with their own hands. That means the chakras themselves were feeling before [but] now the fingers, which are manifested from the power of a particular chakra or chakras, could feel the vibrations. That means the sensitivity of the Divine, which was in the chakras, spread out to peripheries to such an extent that the human being could feel it on the fingers. This was fantastic!

So my job was to move from the centre to the periphery. While moving that, whatever are the obstacles I met, I had to clear them out, one after another. And then, once all the obstacles are cleared out and all the network is properly done, then to generate the energy through this happening of Sahastrar Day. So you can imagine how important is this day!

Now this much is for Myself. I don't know how many of you really know how much the Divine had to work and how many of you are really thankful to the Divine for this tremendous work, which was done through ages and now specially for these forty seven years of my life. Relentlessly it worked, keeping up the facade of a very normal, ordinary person. Because it had to reach to the ordinary, not to the extraordinary but to the ordinary. And one had to take out the extraordinary qualities in the ordinary by making them deeper. This was the tremendous task. But then I must say, that the Sahaj Yoga, when it started working out, I also was given very great workers, tools of Sahaj Yoga, who took it up upon themselves as their own responsibility. And you all should be thankful to them because they really worked very hard with Me, taking [it] up upon themselves as their own responsibility. Very few, but they did.

The rest of them can be divided into many categories:

Some of them just came for their own treatment or something like that, of a very low level.

Or for their relations; when they got realisation they got all their sick relations to me.

Then some of them came for their financial and all sorts of mental problems.

Then some of them came for their family and spiritual problems, for getting rid of that.

But the ones who took it up as their own responsibility, that this is what they have to do, this is their life, this is what their complete meaning is, they put entirely their attention to it and they worked it out, whatever was possible, on their own level.

So today we have to understand one thing that we really need those brave people and those people who feel responsible, which is a very important virtue of Sahaj yogis. While personal things, your own chakras and your own problems and all that is not important because if the whole improves you are going to improve too. If the whole of the body improves you are going to improve. But if one finger improves [and] the rest of the body is suffering, you see, you are not going to be happy either.

So the main thing is what are you doing for Sahaj Yoga? What you can do? How far you can go? How you are going to work it out? In every walk of life and field of life, those who really work it out as a great responsibility upon themselves, are the ones [who] will be given more and more powers and chances.

Then in Sahaja Yoga you will find it's so simple and clean, absolutely clean. There is nothing hanky-panky about it. Right from money up to the point of you people [who] are confiding things into me. You have been telling me all about you, and I know everything about you, which I have taken into my Ocean of Love, and have tried to help you in every way, outside inside solving your problems.

It is so transparent to see how Sahaj Yoga is so much a Mother to you. But whilst taking all the advantage with it, still you are more identified with your own enjoyments and your own idea of enjoyment. You people still do not enjoy that collective Spirit which was opened on the 5th May 1970. You still, in companionship, in company with each other, you enjoy it more like people who are not Sahaj yogis.

Now today is the day to make a big determination that you will start enjoying your collective Spirit. Everything for the collectivity. Then the enjoyment will be maximum. You will never feel that you have sacrificed anything. But unless and until we have more of such people, the other dishwashers are of no use. Just dishwashers or of a very low grade Sahaj yogis are absolutely useless, who just want to take advantage and have a nice time, and all that, type of people. They are not going to make much mark for us. You don't need much intelligence for that, you don't need much money for that. You don't need anything but a complete desire. And one should know that, here, we are going to gain our own flowering, the flowering of the whole, of which we are the part and parcel.

So you must make a determination not to bring Sahaj Yoga to your personal level or to your limited problems, or to your own relationships. It is the relationship of the Creation with God. It’s not your relationship or anybody else's relationship. As in any machine, all the wires must be connected to the mains through one main wire, in the same way you all must be connected to God individually so that you all are connected among yourselves. I've been saying this again and again and again because at Sahasrara you are being blessed of this collective Spirit.

The second very important point is of complete integration within and without. Within, unless and until there is integration, we cannot bring forth the outside integration. The complete integration within, comes by dedicating yourself to your own improvement. First and foremost is: time must be given for your development. Not to show me or not to show anyone! It is between you and yourself. You have to work hard to cleanse yourself. Easy to live comfortably with all the horrible chakras within us, but it is easier also and the best, most enjoyable is, to have very clean chakras.

And it comes [by], first of all, is sincerity. First of all is complete sincerity. Are we sincere to ourselves? Sometimes it is misunderstood. People think if you have to be sincere to ourself we should deny Sahaj Yoga. Sahaj Yog is the union between you and God, and the sincerity must be full, must be complete. Any kind of insincerity which comes into you is extremely detrimental. So you must know that, as your Mother has sincerity about you, you must also have sincerity about yourself. Then you will start enjoying Sahaj Yoga. That is very important to create integration within you because if it is sincerity, it comes from your heart. If it is coming from your heart then your body, your mind, your intelligence, everything will work hard to fulfil it. But if it is not coming from your heart it is going to be a superficial thing.

So you try to feel it from your heart. That's what it means: sincerity. Do not depend on anyone - your wife, husband, children – nothing - mother, father. It's your own. So you have to work in such a way that you get complete integration and the driving force towards integration is a very simple one: is sincerity. Thus you will know that automatically you are getting integrated.

The another factor [which] is important is patience. You must have patience with others, because if you do not have patience your sincerity will start doubting itself. So you must have patience and to get patience you must know what you have been so far and where are you. When you will know what you were, you will have patience with others, tremendous patience. And by having patience with others your sincerity will be all the time complete. By your sincerity you will be completely integrated.

So we come to the point of sincerity. Now let us go deeper into it: how the sincerity is to be maintained. First of all we have to make some determinations, sankalpas (vows), of being sincere. Then we have to act by finding out how do we get insincere on what points. You are good at analysing [so] you can find it out: how do you get insincere, on what points you get insincere, what are the correcting points. Keep a control on your mind to see how does it become insincere.

You'll be amazed that it's simple to be sincere than to be insincere. Is the easiest thing is to be sincere than to be deceiving because you don't have to think. To be sincere you don't have to think. If you have to be insincere you have to think, plan out and to find out methods, all the loopholes and escapes, by which you have to run away. If you have to be captive of your sincerity you don't have to worry about anything and that sincerity itself is rewarding. This principle must be written down in your hearts that sincerity itself is rewarding. You don't have to go to anybody else to ask for the reward of sincerity, sincerity itself rewards you. And that's why you start enjoying your own sincerity. If you start seeing all these things as a witness, that how your sincerity has made you so beautiful, so dignified and how you have started rising in your self-esteem, you'll be amazed how sincerity itself is a big force which will manifest its living dynamism in you and you'll be a transformed person.

This transformation within you is going to change the whole world. People are going to see that you are no more a confused person, you are not a person who is doubting and neither you are a person who is a fanatic. You are not a blind person and you are a person who is alert and aware and who can see things better than others. So, Divine is only interested in such people. As I have told you before that Divine is more interested in a little worm which is alert and aware than in a palace of a king which is dead. The more alert you become the more Divine takes interest in you. But this alertness is nothing but the enlightenment of your sincerity. You'll be amazed how sincerity is the thing. That means you are loyal to yourself. You have to be loyal and not disloyal. The loyalty to yourself is sincerity and that is how I have managed Sahaj Yoga. But sincerity is my nature, I don't have to strive for it. I cannot get out of it. While, if I am your ideal you should try to imbibe my nature, within yourself. And then you will be amazed how you are connected with me. Then we all move like one wave, one being, one personality. That is the achievement of this Sahastrar Day. Sincerity of purpose brought in action, not theory and philosophy, but in action, active sincerity, in every way, and patience - all these things will bring forth the complete integration within.

Once your transformation starts working out, if human beings start getting transformed, tomorrow you will be placed at the helm of affairs everywhere in the society. Try to contact other people at your own level. Whatever may be the category of life you are leading please try to contact them. By doing so you create an atmosphere which starts another circle of evolution which is the outside integration where the societies get integrated. All the people who profess different religions come to this Sahaj Yoga which is today the fruit of all the religions. The integration between political and economic situations, complete ideologies, will integrate because the source of all these is the same. It has gone into disintegration because of its artificial identifications. That's how we'll integrate the whole world into a beautiful integrated Creation, with the purpose of blissful existence for all of us to enjoy!

Good times are ahead now. Maybe next Sahastrar Day, if I am with you, we will start seeing what I have said today. But today all of you must know that you are the base of Sahaj Yoga in UK and in Europe. Try to become sincere and sincere and sincere and enjoy your sincerity.

I bless you all with your sincerity and today I have to tell you a few more secrets about Sahaj Yog is that, for the puja we should not get people who are of mediocre nature because to bear up puja is very difficult. People [who] have not yet understood the value of my Being, of my feet of my hands they cannot, they do not deserve to be here. So do not get anybody because he is your friend, or a sister, or a brother just down here. Is wrong. You are spoiling the chances of the poor person because it is too much for him, he cannot bear it. It is meant for very few people. So remember that it is not meant for many people.

Now what we call as the charan-amrut is, means the ambrose of my feet, or you can say ambrose of my feet, is not meant for everyone. Neither the blessings of the puja are not meant for everyone. So try to avoid people who are not yet fully equipped. First thing they will start is doubting. If they do not doubt, also, there will be a problem with the protocol. They won't be able to accept it with that protocol.

It's a very great privilege to be here and this privilege cannot be granted to every person. If you could understand this is the secret of Sahaj Yoga and in this secret you have to get very few people to begin with. Everything is going to be exposed one day, but not to everyone. If you can recognise this that you are privileged, then you will behave in a way that you have been given this privilege.

Today's day there are many people in the whole world who are meditating. I am thinking of all those people. You have to also think [of] all of them and know that they are part and parcel of my Being as you all are and you are the alert ones. So, at this time in this puja, you are not only doing puja for yourself, for London people, but for the whole world. Not only for Sahaj yogis who are all over, of course for them also, but in this puja you are expressing yourself as Sahaj yogis, you have recognised Me, and are requesting to bless the rest of the people so that they also recognise me as you have recognised.

By this puja I hope recognition will be much more clearer. By my recognition only you will recognise yourself and the whole thing will work out in a very, very beautiful manner. As I have said, next year, on 5th of May, we'll see the results of what I am saying today.

Only thing [is] I want you to be sincere, not to play games in Sahaj Yoga. It will harm you very much and harm also other Sahaj yogis, so don't try to play games. It will harm you because you will be harming the path of emancipation and as a result you will be punished, as a result you will be the loser. So please try to be sincere. It is not difficult. This is not the way to be taken: many people I have seen, they think I am chastitising and all these words are wrong for Mataji it should not be used, [that] there are many words which should not be used for me.

It is just your privilege to be here and [you] must understand that privileges are given to people who are deserving. I am telling you these things because you are deserving. And in that condition you must understand that this is a great privilege that I am telling you all these things and that you should feel enamoured that I am telling you that: sincerity is the key of your success.

It's a privilege. I am giving you the key. While as it is, you see, the Western mind is, people think that, if you tell somebody something like that they can use a word like 'chastitise' (sic) and all these words are not to be. "Must use words which are protocolish. [It's] not proper." If in your protocol you are not alright, you know how you start fitting wrong bolts into wrong nuts and spoil the whole joke, so be careful as to how you take it. Take it as a privilege. It’s a VIP treatment for you. You are all VIP's. I cannot talk like this to the multitudes but I can tell you this because I want to give you the complete keys.

If you can look at yourself as how privileged you are and understanding it, understanding what all Sahaj Yoga is, then you will understand that - what a privilege it is for you to be here, what [good] fortune, what reward for what you have done. How many lives have been completely rewarded by being here. This will help you to do puja in a more sincere manner.

May God bless you!

Now we must meditate, also, after puja, because my vibrations you do not suck in without meditation I have seen. And always it happens - so far I have had very few pujas in which my whole vibrations were sucked in. If you have sincerity about it, really the sincerity part of it, you'll suck all my vibrations. Tell your mind not to ask questions and to misbehave but to suck the vibrations clearly. This is for your own nourishment, for your own growth, for your own enjoyment.

May God bless you.

Today I am so heavy laden already, that I can't open my eyes.

May God bless you.

Let us start the puja. Alright?

Shri Mataji: You can start.

Yogis: Om Twameva Sakshat Shri Nirmala Vidya Sakshat Shri Adi Shakti Sakshat Shri Bhagawati Sakshat Shri Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi Namoh Namaha.

Shri Mataji: Again.

Yogis: Om Twameva Sakshat Shri Nirmala Vidya Sakshat Shri Adi Shakti Sakshat Shri Bhagawati Sakshat Shri Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi Namoh Namaha.

Shri Mataji: Again.

Yogis: Om Twameva Sakshat Shri Nirmala Vidya Sakshat Shri Adi Shakti Sakshat Shri Bhagawati Sakshat Shri Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi Namoh Namaha.

Shri Mataji: The Swadishthana is better now. Come along. Are you feeling alright too? (Person: “Yes...”.)

Good. Alright? Are you feeling the cool now, cool? Haven’t you? Cool breeze.

Yogi: Heart.

Shri Mataji: Right heart?

Yogi: Left heart.

Shri Mataji: Left heart. Is he better? Swadishthana is better...

Alright? (laughing). Now come along.

You see, if you can take out your coat you come along. I’ll just see your ??... How many days did he...

Yogi: I think maybe since two years

Shri Mataji: Two years. Everything works out...

There. That’s alright.

How are you now John, are you better? Better, relaxed? Alright. Now, one thing is you are not to feel guilty about anything. Whatever has happened has happened. Done, so done. Not to feel guilty, because that makes things much worse. Alright? Things like that, just don’t worry.

Yogi: Yes. Mother.

Shri Mataji: Don’t worry. That’s the point.

Now. John? Yes. Left Vishuddhi is cleared out.

Yogi: Thank You, Shri Mataji

Shri Mataji: See. Give it. See? Here... You can give bandhan for this... Give her a bandhan. Yes.

Now. See your reflection, I’m not sure (laughter). Ha!

Yogini: Thank You

Shri Mataji: What is you don’t know? What is to be said. It works. Here? Here you are.

Yogi: Yes

Shri Mataji: Are you cured? John, how are you? Alright. Now you don’t put your neck here and there, or anything, you sit straight!

Because when the Kundalini rises you should be quiet, and you should be steady. Steadiness is one of the signs of Realisation. Should become very steady. I can sit on one posture from nine to ten – I mean I have sat, I don’t know how much I can still! (Laughter) - But I have sat on one posture. Alright?

Bala? Yes. Hang on... (inaudible words due to bad quality audio) Thank you.

Yogi: Just a bit of right heart.

Shri Mataji: Rama’s mantra did you take that?

Yogi: Pardon?

Shri Mataji: I said, Ramachandra. Did you do Rama?

Yogi: I think he doesn’t know, Mother

Shri Mataji: Eh? Did you do any mantras, Rama’s mantras? You don’t know.

Yogi: I just don’t understand.

Shri Mataji: You don’t know.

Yogi: No

Yogi: So it is - so it is the right heart.

Shri Mataji: You are? What is it?

Yogi: Kidding, kidding

Shri Mataji: You really are?

Yogi: Yes, very much so.

Shri Mataji: This is only for England or for anybody else? (Laughter) Because this “ing” – the only sound of England, you know? Not in Sanskrit – [that is] wrong - there’s nothing like ‘ing’ – of any kind (laughter)

(Long unclear section due to bad quality audio – conversation about sounds in different languages continues)

Shri Mataji seems to say “Ing is not there”. Then Shri Mataji says that in Sanskrit there is a sound, which sounds like Igan, “a very big combination” between “I”(pronounced I) who is the Mother of the Universe and ‘Gan’ who is Ganesha, so it’s a very big combination”. The sound would be something like “Igan” – nasal sound – “in Sanskrit”.

The yogi repeats the words ‘kidding, kidding’ accentuating the final ‘ing’ )

Put the attention to him instead. He’ll be alright... just can’t be negative. Really he understands... that what is going to happen to him... Good. Better now.

(Shri Mataji says some mantras) Ha! ...

Ha. It is a left problem ... with his Agnya. You just say the name of Mahavira, the deity of you know, left side. When you just can’t take it out, it is Mahavira, because... his Agnya, Vishuddhi... formulate the mantras ... Mahavira. Say: Twameva Sakshat Shri...

Yogis: Mahavira. Om Twameva Sakshat Shri Mahavira Sakshat Shri Adi Shakti Sakshat Shri Bhagawati Sakshat Shri Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi Namoh Namaha.

Om Twameva Sakshat Shri Mahavira Sakshat Shri Adi Shakti Sakshat Shri Bhagawati Sakshat Shri Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi Namoh Namaha.

Shri Mataji: Are you ok? Are you alright? Should believe Me. You’ll be very good. Should be alright John? Good. Better?

Catching completely on his Agnya.

Yogi: Gruha Lakshmi

Shri Mataji: Hm?

Yogi: Gruha Lakshmi

Shri Mataji: Alright. Say the mantra.

Yogis: Om Twameva Sakshat Shri Gruha Lakshmi Sakshat Shri Adi Shakti Sakshat Shri Bhagawati Sakshat Shri Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi Namoh Namaha.

Om Twameva Sakshat Shri Gruha Lakshmi Sakshat Shri Adi Shakti Sakshat Shri Bhagawati Sakshat .... (Shri Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi Namoh Namaha).
