Public Program, Graz (Austria), 10 June 1988.

I bow to all the seekers of truth.

This song that you have heard has been composed in the year of 1600. And in this song the poet has sung for the rustic people, in their language. That, "Oh Mother, give us our Realization!" "Jogawa" means the yoga, the union with the Divine and the Sahaja Yoga means spontaneous. It fills My heart to see how since long the seekers have been asking for this union with the Divine. What a search! What a seeking! By the very simple people of the villages. Today we have so many people who are great seekers of truth. At the same time there are many people who are in the market, they are selling all kinds of things in the market, in the name of the Divine or God.

One has to realize that this union with the Divine works out through a living force. Just like a seed gets sprouted spontaneously when placed in the Mother Earth, in the same way this residual force of Kundalini is sprouted. Now in the song when they are saying "Ude, Ude, Ambe!" Then they are meaning - Ambe means the Kundalini, Ude means now please awaken, awaken, awaken!

So this Kundalini has to be awakened. This is the residual force within us, which is in 3 1‚ÅÑ2 coils. And which when awakened passes through the six centers, pierces through your fontanel bone area, then you get your real baptism - real! For which you cannot pay, because living process doesn't understand money. Supposing you pay some money to your apple tree will it give you more apples? Any effort on your part it won't work out, because it is spontaneous. Many people stand on their heads thinking that if you stand upside down the Kundalini from down below will come out.

[Inaudible ?] they try to awaken this Kundalini within themselves. Just like a candle which is not yet enlightened cannot be enlightened by itself, you need another enlightened light to enlighten it. But once that candle is enlightened can enlighten other candles. And this works spontaneously. So one has to know though we are frustrated very much, the way people are talking about God and just making money out of it. Either they are money oriented or they are power-oriented. Like you have heard people have to pay some money to a temple or to a church. But what can church give you, or what can a temple give you? Unless and until your Kundalini is awakened? For example this is an instrument which is not connected to the mains, what's the use of this instrument? It has to be connected to the mains, and that is why we find all these so called religions going in the opposite direction. You have to become the Spirit, is said by all the scriptures. But that doesn't mean that you can just brand, "Now, I've become the Spirit," and say, "I'm a twice-born." What is the difference between a person who is twice-born and who is not? A twice-born person has powers. Powers not to kill but to love, and love that acts. As you know Christ touched people and they got cured. In the same way there could be some healers also. But they are trying some tricks, because in their own life they are very materialistic, they charge money for curing you. They have no authority to call themselves as something realized souls.

So we have to be honest about our seeking and should ask for the truth only. Because falsehood is not going to give you satisfaction. You will go on from one to another to another. Falsehood will ultimately make you frustrated and unhappy. So for genuineness and goodness one has to understand that the time has come for you to get Realization. I call it the Blossomtime. In the beginning on the Tree of Life there were one or two flowers. But today it is Blossomtime where many have to get their Realization. It's the last breakthrough in your evolution that you have to become the Spirit. Your Spirit is the one which gives you absolute truth. Once you get your Realization, then you start feeling Cool Breeze of the Holy Ghost in your hands. The All pervading power of God's Love about which so many scriptures have written. And you start acting like a computer which is already programmed very beautifully. You get absolutely truthful answers to all the questions that you ask.

Now all these centers are within you and there is a Kundalini in the triangular bone called as Sacrum. But this knowledge of the roots are not to be accepted as truth at this point, but could be with a scientific open mind called as a hypothesis. Once you have the experience of this All pervading power and the power flowing through your being then you have to believe us. But it's not only that you get your Self Realization, you have to become a Sahaja Yogi. We have no organization, we have no cult, we have no sect, we have no recording of the names of the people who are Sahaja Yogis. It is you who has to feel it, experience it, and have to become and certify yourself.

As you become a self realized person you yourself become your own Guru, you don't need any other guru. You become your own master, you become absolutely free from all temptations, and all habits. Of course your physical problems, mental problems get solved. It is as simple, supposing tomorrow you become the king, so all your financial problems are solved. In the same way when you become the Spirit all your worldly problems are solved. It acts like a shot. In the early days of course it used to take lot of time but nowadays even to go to moon takes no time. So in modern times you should say the Kundalini has taken the speed, and sometimes Myself amazed the way it acts. It is so fast and acts on so many people that I start wondering, "Look at the speed."

So it acts and I would just say that you have to take your Realization. Now there could be so many questions in your mind. They've asked Me, I don't know how many questions yesterday and day before. But these questions are on the mental level, but with this happening you go beyond all that. Is a happening that takes place and just spontaneously without any thinking, without any effort, without any money, but there is no guarantee for it. It may work, it may not work, it depends on your preparation, depends on how open you are, depends on what is your seeking. Because Kundalini is the energy of pure desire. All other desires are impure because we are never satisfied with them. They say that in general the desires are not satiable. So this is the Pure Desire within us that we have to become one with the Divine.

This summer I am having really a very fast touring all over and when I came to Austria I thought I should again go to Graz, but I am here only for tonight. I wish I could be here for more time, but in this short time without wasting much time let us get our Realization. But I think if you have any questions you can ask Me some questions, not too many, because we shouldn't waste too much time. But the question should not be aggressive, because I've not come here to take anything from you. I have come here to give you something that is your own, your very own. Your own property, your own wealth. I have to just give you the key. No obligation, neither towards you, towards Me, it's just has to happen. So if you have any questions you can ask Me.

Question: Is it possible to overcome death - with pure desire?

Shri Mataji: All right. (Shri Mataji laughing) We are all living so why should we talk of death? And we have to overcome death by entering into the realm of Spirit which never dies. The Spirit is eternal, so we live in the eternal life. I have already given lots of lectures only on this subject, but if you want we can give you the tapes you can listen to them for hours together.

We should live in the present and not in the future. If the present is all right, future takes its own course. The past has finished and the future doesn't exist.

They have become thoughtless, I think. (Shri Mataji laughing)

No thoughts? (Shri Mataji laughing) I think you have already reached the first state of thoughtless awareness. (Shri Mataji laughing) Very good.

So let us now have the experiment, it will take hardly ten minutes, and those who don't want to do it should leave the hall. It's not civil to sit here when you don't want to have Realization. And it cannot be done for people who don't want it, because your freedom is to be respected.

I hope they have place to sit down, otherwise they could sit here, if they want. If you have no room, you can sit here.

The gentleman asking about death has gone. (Shri Mataji laughing) Interesting it is.

It's very simple. You will have to take help from the Mother Earth, so it's better to take out your shoes, so also there's relaxed feet. Better stand here and show them, all right? You can show them.

Now, you have to use your left hand to express your desire to have Realization, is a symbol. And we have to use our right hand to relax our centers. Of course the Kundalini can rise spontaneously but by this I will tell you how you can later on also increase the flow of Kundalini. So I'll show you first of all, you can see it for yourself that the left hand is towards Me and the right hand is on the heart. Now in the heart resides the Spirit, but this is the seat of the Spirit - the fontanel bone area. Which was a soft bone in your childhood.

Now you put your right hand on your stomach on the left hand side, in the upper part. Now, we are working on the left hand side. Now this is the center of your mastery. Like this - on your lap. Then you take down your hand in the lower part of your abdomen on the left hand side. This is the center through which the pure knowledge of the Divine laws work. So you go back again on the left hand side of your abdomen in the upper part and press it hard. Then you put back your hand on your heart. Now you put your hand in the corner between your neck and your shoulder like this and turn your head to the right. This is the center which catches quite a lot because you feel guilty. You have to understand that you are the epitome of evolution and you are the temple of the Spirit. So you don't have to in anyway feel guilty or in anyway blame yourself or find false with yourself. You have to be very pleasantly placed towards yourself. Forget about the past and have respect about yourself.

Now you take your right hand on top of your forehead and press it on both the sides. This is the center of Christ, who has taught us to forgive - the greatest weapon. So this is the center of forgiveness. Now push back your hand and hold your head on top of that on the back side of your head. This is the center through which we ask for forgiveness, but you are not to feel guilty, not to count your mistakes. Now stretch your hand and put the center of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area. Now bend your head, stretch your fingers and press your scalp and move it seven times clockwise. That's all we have to do, so now let's see.

Now we have to close our eyes. It's very simple things. Put both the feet at parallel away from each other. You have to sit straight but not stiff, don't bend your head backward of forward, be comfortable. Now, close your eyes and please don't open them till I tell you. If you have your glasses you can take them out.

Now, please put your right hand on your heart. Here is the center of your Spirit and you please ask Me a very fundamental question three times. Please ask three times, if you want to call Me 'Shri Mataji' all right, otherwise call Me 'Mother', "Mother, am I the Spirit?" Please ask this question three times.

With this question another one follows, because if you are your master, if you are your Spirit, you are the master of yourself. So put your hand in the upper part of you abdomen on the left hand side and press it with your fingers. Now here you say, "Mother, am I my own master?" Please ask this question three times. "Am I my own guide? Am I my own Guru?" Just ask anyone of these questions three times.

Now, take your hand in the lower part of your abdomen and press it hard. Here you have to ask - I cannot force on you, because your freedom is respected. This is the center of Pure knowledge of Divine laws. So here please ask, "Mother, may I have the knowledge - the pure knowledge of Divine laws? Mother, please give me the pure knowledge of the Divine!" Please say it six times because this center has six petals.

As you say this your Kundalini starts rising and now we have to help the Kundalini to pass through your chakras by helping your chakras to open your centers to open. So now raise your hand in the upper part of your abdomen on the left hand side. Here you have to say with full confidence to help the Kundalini, "Mother, I am my own master." Please say it ten times.

Now you have to know that God Almighty is a Ocean of Love and is Ocean of Bliss. We only can experience Him through our Spirit. So now raise your right hand on your heart and say with full confidence again, "Mother, I am the Spirit!" Say it twelve times. This is the greatest and the most fundamental truth about you.

Now as I told you that you have no business to judge yourself and make yourself miserable. You have to forgive yourself, because this Ocean of Love above all is the Ocean of Forgiveness. And you cannot commit any mistakes that cannot be dissolved in this ocean. So please raise your right hand on the shoulder, between the shoulder and the neck in the corner, press it hard and turn your head to the right. And here you have to say with full confidence in yourself, without feeling guilty, without feeling guilty or counting your mistakes, "Mother, I am not guilty at all." Say it 16 times. And even after that if you feel guilty then you can take a punishment for saying it 108 times. (Shri Mataji laughing)

Now, take your right hand on top of your forehead and press it on both the sides. Here you have to say, "Mother, I forgive everyone." It's not how many times, but from your heart. Many think that it's difficult to forgive, but it is a myth whether you forgive it or not forgive, but if you don't forgive then you play into wrong hands. So please forgive from your heart - everyone.

Now, please take your hand on the back side of your head and put your head on it so that - and put it upwards. Now here without feeling guilty, without feeling you have done anything wrong, just say for your own satisfaction that, "Oh Divine, if I have done any mistakes please forgive me."

Now stretch your hand, and put your center of your palm on top of your fontanel bone and press it hard. Move your scalp seven times saying, "Mother, please give me my Realization." Because I cannot force on you, you have to ask for it, press it hard and stretch your fingers.

(Shri Mataji is blowing into the microphone)

Please remove your hand and open your eyes. Now put your right hand towards Me like this, and bend your head and see for yourself if there is a Cool Breeze coming out of your head.

Now put your left hand towards Me and bend your head and see with your right hand if there is a Cool Breeze. Some people get it very far also.

Now, again put once more your right hand. You have not forgiven that's the point is. Please forgive. Now, with the right hand and left hand you see, if there is a Cool Breeze is coming. If it is not coming just say, "I forgive, I forgive everyone."

Now raise your both the hands and bend your head back and ask a question, "Mother, is this the Cool Breeze of the Holy Ghost?" You can ask, "Is this the power of love that is All pervading?" In Sanskrit it is called as Brahmachaitanya. In Arabic it's called as Ruh. So ask this question three times.

All right, now put down your hands please. All those who have felt Cool Breeze out of their heads or in their hands please raise both your hands. Both, both the hands.

Look at this Graz - everybody has got it.

May God bless you all!

Those who have not got can be looked after by Sahaja Yogis. You can go at the back and they will look after you. You all can get it.

I bow to you all - really.

Now those who haven't got it can go at the back and the Sahaja Yogis can look after you.

In the same way - in the same way when you get your Realization you can give Realizations to others. But you have to come to the center and master the knowledge. Many people get Realization and get lost. I come back after one year, they say, "Mother, we lost our vibrations. Three days we felt very nice then we lost it." So that is not proper. You must respect yourself and your Realization and you must see to it that you develop it in proper lines and that you become masters. The time has come for all of us to change this world - to transform it. And this is what is the new age and the new race. Not just people who start using this name or that name.

All right, those who haven't got can come here also, will be better because we can see them who they are. Those who haven't got it can come this side, nothing to feel shy.

Those who want to meet Me can come on the stage. Please look after them, come along the Sahaja Yogis, come along.

And those who haven't got it please come this side and get it. Anybody who is sick, who is not well can also come this side. Oh, there are too many. So what will you do? Some could sit this side. But those who want to meet Me can come here this way. All you got your Realization, I think. May God bless you!

You're all right. May God bless you! Feeling nice now?

These are Sahaja Yogis. (Shri Mataji laughing) All the Sahaja Yogis should help others. Yes, go ahead.

You haven't got, madam? All right, come here. Just stand here. Just come and stand here. It's all right. Put it in your pocket, that's all. Now, can you stand up?

Come here on the other side.

Did you forgive? Come. Now, forgive, forgive, forgive, forgive, forgive, forgive, forgive. Just forgive. Now, all right? See now, I told you, you did not forgive. (Shri Mataji laughing) She has got it. May God bless you!

Now, must develop it, you see, you must come to the center and become a master. Next time I must see you as a great Sahaja Yogi. May God bless you!

Is she feeling? All right.

Seeker: Mother I forgive everyone.

[Inaudible ?]

Don't think about it, don't think. You can't think about it. Now come to the people and establish yourself, all right?
