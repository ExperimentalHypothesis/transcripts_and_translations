Today is the time when you have to depart and go to the other side of this country to see a very beautiful scenic place, but I will be going to Ratnagiri for my programme. I hope you’re not feeling tortured too much in your (laughs). After all, 250 persons is too big, but somehow you have been very considerate and cooperative that you all took all the inconveniences with such pleasant faces. One has to understand that when we have love you can adjust yourself to any circumstance and you can live with so many people without feeling the inconveniences. But to feel that love for another person, the love that is without lust and greed, the love that is pure, you have to be the spirit. The comfort of the spirit gives you the comfort, not the comfort outside. So it is such a co-related thing. That first your spirit has to achieve a certain state and then the spirit has to reach a certain understanding of another person through a spirit, not through the mind, not through the body, not through the circumstances, but through the spirit. When you feel the others spirit, when you get the satisfaction of the spirit and not of the body. But this is a very subtle point which sometimes we miss. When we start judging others we don’t see the spirit, what we see: how he walks, how he talks, how he behaves. But actually that is all outside. The inner being is the spirit and if you can feel the inner being, then you will realize that if the inner being is beautiful you enjoyed the most. This time I must say you started on a very high note of understanding of each other and also of Indians. The subtlety of the spiritual growth is that one starts feeling integrated, with a group, with the humanity. The humanity becomes part and parcel of your being. This is the subtler side of the growth. Then you don’t think of a person as outright bad or outright good but you start understanding the goodness of a person through your spirit by which you generate more goodness in that person. But supposing there’s somebody who is absolutely useless and good for nothing, such a person is thrown out of the organsiation of spiritual growth, which is a living truth. Like in nature you will find whatever is not wanted it thrown out. When the calyx of a flower does not play any role in the making of a fruit, he calyx is thrown out. In the same way, a person who does not play any role in the collective attainment of his own, the useless things are thrown out, automatically. All useful things are retained, and all useless things are thrown out. So one must understand that integrity in oneself is very important.

There have been some reporting about people not understanding. For example, one should not think that you have come here for a holiday. Then you also have to understand that there are certain protocols in Sahaj yoga. For example, husband and wife, now they must understand that they have come here for their individual growth and not together. And they should not oppose such a thing when it is told, they should not try to disturb others, it’s being uncivil to disturb others by their behavior. They have not come here to spend a nice holiday. But they have come here to achieve something. Individually. If that is understood then you will not feel that you are deprived of any pleasures or so called comforts. Pleasures are temporary; they vanish into thin air. But eternal life is that in which you live without doing anything and in a state of complete cohesiveness, complete oneness, with complete concord, with the music of God’s flute. To deprive yourself of that is stupid and foolish for something nonsensical. So those who object also to such a growth, to such a understanding are actually going against themselves. India has very subtle vibrations, it has very subtle spiritual understanding. It’s like you are entering into the deep roots of spirituality. And it is, a very different type of a culture if you see that, and that only be understood if you develop your innocence, that why these people are so innocent and they feel hurt when you tell them we will not have our food today. They think you’re being slighted or you’re unhappy or something has gone wrong. They can never understand that you are saying no to the food because you are full. That’s not done in India. It’s bad manners to say that we will not have the food. Can you imagine? It is regarded as very bad manners to say that we will not have any food because then people feel that we must have done something wrong that they are feeling this way.

So as a simple thing I would say as a guideline, when you don’t want to have your food, it is alright but you can come there and eat a little bit at least so that they feel you are (______inaudible_____). Because they feel all the time inside themselves, that oh God why didn’t he eat, he’s without food, he’s starving himself and they’ll feel very hurt.

There’s a system, eating within us, I mean that it’s so natural to us that if you’re angry we don’t eat our food or supposing we are angry in the house, that we start doing some work that we have never done before, like, you see we’ll start washing, or doing cleaning, then people know you are angry. That’s a sign of anger shown. But it’s a very natural style, I think because they are very natural people. But then unnatural styles are different. Supposing somebody comes or a child comes to the house and he tells his mummy, I’m not going to eat the food, then the mother will say alright, scoot! Doesn’t matter. But here the mother will ask why, what’s the matter, why don’t you eat? What is the problem? What will you have? I’ll give you this. I’ll give you that. But it won’t be such that supposing a child comes from outside in the fridge there are all kinds of A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, everything kept there, he can have whatever he likes. No bothers. He does feel happy because he has a choice but he’s very unhappy inside that nobody’s bothered about me. Then it becomes a part and parcel of the being, personality and you don’t mind. So many things people don’t mind in the west, and I am amazed at it. How can they tolerate these things? Where people neglect you, where people say harsh things, where people do not even offer a cup of tea to you, but people don’t mind in the west.

Another thing is that even if it comes to telling lies, we don’t mind to tell people that you should not hurt them. Like supposing I am in the house and there are many people who come to see me and we don’t want to hurt them, then there is no sin in telling them that mother is not here, you better go away. Because they won’t feel hurt. But if you say she’s here but she will not see you, it will hurt them. So this kind of honesty also is lacking here. That we tell them everything on their faces whether they like it or not. It’s (___inaudible one word___). It jars in human nature. And once you start jarring human nature, all the delicacies and the beauties of their characters disappears. And they become like charged, charred charcoal. They cannot feel anything that is sensitive, that is subtle, that is beautiful. One after another the shocks start coming into the childhood, then they become absolutely immune to it. There is no ‘sankoch’, there is no formality, inner formality, not outside formality. ‘Sankoch’ is not formality but it is an inner formality that you don’t feel like saying things, how can you say it to them. Now supposing a child comes to your house and spills some milk or something on your carpet. Immediately somebody will come and clean it in the presence of the mother. This we will not do. To us, the carpet is not more important. The most important thing is the mother, that she should not feel hurt. These things, material things, should not be normally not be important to western people because they are so much easily developed that they can always get a replacement of their carpets so it doesn’t matter. But they don’t mind hurting another person for something material which is trivial which is absolutely frivolous, is of no value. The culture of the spirit has to be developed and the culture of the spirit lies in this country. It was once upon a time in the West also but you have lost it quite a lot. So today to establish that culture you have to (___inaudible one word___).

But there are so many qualities you have which Indians have to learn. You are very intelligent, you understand Sahaj yoga is the only only way you can save the world. You have so many qualities that I cannot really in one line tell you all those things that the qualities western people have. Only thing what lacks is the inner spiritual culture which one has to learn. When you talk. When you speak. When you have relations with others. Like in India, if an elder brother scolds you, shouts at you, nobody feels bad at all. It is expected. They never talk to children as if they are lords. Children don’t guide the children. Let the parents guide the children. So if somebody, an elder or a leader says something to you, then don’t think he is bossy. It is important. It’s very individualistic culture we have in the west and that’s why we have problems. While the collective culture doesn’t exist there. Now. It might be existing once upon a time. They had wars and things and there are calamities, then they all used to join together and work it out. But nowadays as the situation is that there is no collective culture. Today, I will request you to develop that culture within yourselves. The collective culture. And in that collective culture you will see that you will enjoy each others’ company much more than anything else in the world. Without having any lust or greed any impurity in it, just you will enjoy each other’s company. That collective culture is to be imbibed and to be brought in within yourself. Nobody minds any discomfort when he is in love. But that is carnal, while you have to have spiritual love. And that collective culture slowly if all the Sahaj yogis of the West can imbibe, I tell you, you can give great leadership to the whole world. Because that’s the only thing lacking in the West. That’s the only thing they have to achieve is the collective culture. Complete love and understanding. Complete integration, cohesiveness.

This time the group has been very very nice. I was so surprised that 60% are new people but so good. The quality of people is so very good, they’re not mediocres. And I could feel the oneness with which they are moving. So now we are looking forward to another very important occasion is the weddings of the people. And in that we have to see that there are 51 marriages we’ll have to perform. So everybody should learn to enjoy those 51 marriages. Maybe, there may be some problems, or loopholes or something. May not be not efficient of course though it has always worked out very well. Maybe maybe. But try to enjoy every bit. Open your hearts. Try to enjoy every bit of it. The collective marriages of 51 people. And individually you will find all of them having a very beautiful expression and a very beautiful aspiration and the whole thing will be very beautiful if you have that collective understanding in yourself. Otherwise, you’ll say I didn’t get this, I didn’t get that. Last time the marriages were very beautiful. And it’s in a jungle along the seashore we will be having these marriages. Try to enjoy it. And try to make it a success. And after marriages also you must remember that if you cannot make two persons live together happily how are we going to make the whole world live together. So both must accept the situation, the wife and the husband. Two different personalities of different temperaments have to live together to show to the world that if two persons cannot live together then how can the whole world live. And these two persons make a symbolic expression of that unity about which I am saying. You being all realized souls, you should really have a very nice time after your marriage. But too much of everything is bad. Must keep the control. Should not go too much into it. Must keep a kind of control. And if you can keep the kind of a control then you will enjoy marriage in its fullness. So we are looking forward to that neat occasion of 51 marriages. I hope there’s going to be 51. Just now we have only 49 people. I must say that Warren has done a good job, though everybody tries to...

Actually, he wants to buy me a present for the wedding. I think he should have it instead of me having it. He has really done wonderful things and I shoot off like a star from here to there and I say find a person form Asia Minor another from Timbuctoo and he just accepts it. It works out. It works out. So I hope you will try to cooperate with me. Cooperate with the spirit. Cooperate with this great movement of the whole world. And this to know your responsibility that this marriage you are doing for Sahaj Yoga. For the emancipation of the whole humanity. And that’s how if you understand your responsibility you will understand that marriage is not for yourself or for your own comforts or anything. It is for the comfort of the world. May God bless you!

This is, we have to give a hand to Mr. Modi the one who has arranged all your things. (Applause). Then again Mr Jagtap who’s the executive engineer of this place, the one who has developed this place. Can you imagine such a man, so constructive beautifully he’s done it, and it’s shown by his kindness and love, the way he has done it, each and everything for you. I mean, just think of it. Can you think of any executive engineer in the West doing so much for the visiting saints. He’s done so much for you. I am very thankful to them and to all the other Indian Sahaj yogis who have done so much for us, worked so hard, organized everything for us, looked after so well. So I am thanking them. You please give a hand for Mr Jagtap.

And also to all the Indian Sahaj Yogis. Also.

May God bless you!
