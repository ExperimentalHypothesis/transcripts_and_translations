Public Program. Santa Cruz (USA), 17 October 1981.

(Introduction by Gregor)

I am very fortunate and I am very happy that I could come to Santa Cruz.
I can see what I am facing is the Ocean of Love, the seekers of Love, the people who are seeking the Truth.
Gregor has told you all these things, because he is very earnest, he is very concerned, he knows you are seekers and THAT’S (this is )why he has told you in these words, so don’t be frightened, there is nothing to be frightened about that.
You are seekers and you are a special category. In the eyes of God, seekers are the highest creation that He has created. You are the highest of all. To Him it does not matter who are rich, who are in power, who are (is) leading a life of so-called success; it does not matter to Him at all, He does not understand that, He does not know that.
Christ has said that these people if they want gold let them have; they have bars of gold and LIVE( leave) with it. But “If they seek Me, if they love Me”, then these people who are seekers today are going to enter into the Kindom of God and He will eat with them, they will seat at the same table.
You are respected because you are seekers; you are loved, because you are seekers. And you have survived despite all the attacks (on you), these are all attacks. You are [NAIVE.], you are simple, you were innocent at that time when attacks came.(in)
Now gradually you are discovering that it was an attack. Everything, everything that you did was just to put you down.
And one person who was negative of that kind would come forward and assert and use all the negative forces to push you down.

To Me you are My children. To Me, I doN'T (not) think what you'VE (have) done, because you didN'T (not) meet Me that time. I take the load upon Myself.
I did come to SAN JOSE last time. They said “There are lots of seekers settling down in Santa Cruz”, they did tell.
I wanted to come and see you here that time only, but the experience I had of the people who were there, I thought “They are not just out seeking God, but they are sort of seeking ego or superego”, sort of they are seeking into a new style of life and a new style of understanding, because they found out that material life is of no value, is not going to give them joy.
At that time, when I said that in your thinking of these things how can you pay for it? And nobody could understand these things, it was very difficult to talk to them, that “It is spontaneous, it is your own right that you have to get it. You have been seeking for ages now, not only in this life time. You have been saints in many lives and now you are born here to seek it”.
It is so simple like that, it has to happen, that’s your nature, that’s what you are; you try anything else, you won’t be satisfied till you are found out the Truth.
But that time nobody would listen to Me, it was a very funny situation and I ultimately decided that let them find out for themselves to begin with. When they will find it out, they have to reach the right conclusion. Because there is one problem in the seeking, that you have to seek in your own freedom, in your own glory of your own choice. Because if you are to be liberated, it has to be a free choice. A person is not free – he say – he is enticed or he is hypnotised or he is overpowered by others. He has no freedom at all of any kind, such a person is useless to enter into the Kingdom of God. If you are to become the King, then you have to have that basic freedom in yourself [..]_____(0007/0664-00:05:20)
But freedom doesn’t mean ego by any chance, it never means ego. If you think: “I like it, I love it, I do it”, that’s not the Spirit. You are not seekers of ego, I must tell you very frankly, you are not, you are seekers of Truth, of Love, of Joy. For ages you’ve been seeking that, joy is the result. When you get to that position where you become your Spirit, your Atma, you should be in joy, not… telling about it, talking about it, but enjoying it. And that has to happen to you. It’s a happening for which you are built-in for ages .

Today in general I will tell you what you are really and what you have to expect, to become what, nobody has told you about it. They said “All right, you'll come to us into a new age”; “All right”, people said “Let’s go and join!”. Somebody said that you’ll get this enjoyment.
William Blake – I must say – is one of the greatest prophets of the modern times. For you, western people, he said that “The men of God” that is you people, you are people of God, you are not of this gross level. You people don't understand you that does not mean that I don’t understand, I know you, what you are. I know what it is, I can feel it, I just feel that. He said “Men of God will become prophets, and these prophets will have powers to make others prophets”.
This is what we have to expect within ourselves.
(Don’r worry about her, she has a problem here [Shri Mataji indicates the centre heart]. She will be all right)
So you have to become the prophet and you have to make others prophet. Now this is the point you should judge: have you become a prophet? what is a prophet? Prophet is a person who can feel the all-parveding power around.
Now I said that there is all-pervading power of Love, I say that. Oh you also sing the song, they say “Yes, there is all-pervading power”. Many people also feel that they are feeling it, but it's not true. We have to be honest to ourselves because we are seekers, we should not cheat ourselves; because this is ego that makes you cheat. This intelligence is the worst thing. Gregoire himself told me one day that “I find my intelligence is trying to cheat me”. Very intelligently.
So one has to be very careful to understand that you have to become that. You are the loser, you are the loser. Nobody else.
If you play around with your ego, you are the loser. Or with your superego, your conditionings or mesmerism or hypnosis, or your ideas about having a kind of life… all that, could be a great barrier to be the Spirit, which is a different thing all together is beyond this.

So when you become the Spirit, what happens to you, what should you expect? Of course it's true that there is this power around us, this all-pervading power is there.
Now if I say there are lots of plays going on here, there is music going on here, everything is there, you won’t believe, If I bring the television and say “Now, this is the one which is going to show you”, you will say “Oh”; I mean, you know it, but in India, if I take it to a village who has never seen a television, will you say “This box?”. How can it do it? But you put it to the mains and a fantastic thing can happen, it catches all .
In the same way, when you become that, when you get.. just it is a little breakthrough, is just the plugging to the mains, just that, you are all ready for that, just that. And a fantastic thing happens. First you start feeling it all around, first. Now don’t jump into ego then, that’s not the end of it. You first start feeling it around.
Then you start understanding that your centres are on your fingers 03:32 file 0671 Feel the tips we say. Its a very good.

CONTINUATION… File #TASCAM_0664

“Fingertips" you say. It’s very good, it’s on my fingertips. (03:09) These are the veer are the master of that. Then you start feeling it around and you know that it is there. Then I’m here just to decode it, to tell you, that this is what this finger means, this - you verify it. It is so much surprising when people verify it. There was a gentleman in London, I had 70 [people] in London who worked on that for four years, English people you know are a little difficult to crack. I should say after 4 years they really got their realization in a proper way… and after that now we have thousands of people who are realized in England. Because once they find something, then they get to it. They’re not the people who are shifty. Some of them that — which I always see that balance in them. Like they understand that if you’ve found a little water in a place, then go on digging there alone to have the well. Don’t leave that and go to another place and dig well and dig well and dig well; you see they can know where to stop. So these people they are very,very skeptical in the beginning, extremely. One of them got Realization and he said “Mother, he said, it is all pervading, it has got telecommunication and all everything. What about my Father who has not telephoned to me and who always writes to me, has not written to me. He’s in Scotland. I said:”All right.[00:04:58-UNCLEAR]. I said :”You feel it! Let’s put your hands like that.” And he said:”I am getting a burning here!”. I said:”All right. That means that he must be down with very bad bronchitis. These are the centers of your father and this is the center which denotes this finger. You telephone to him and find out!”. He telephoned to him. Mother said exactly the same centers that he is down with very bad bronchitis. Now this could be a [00:05:31-UNCLEAR-cock and goat] story, you see, the way Gregoire was telling you,It was time to establish my credibility to you, because you see, it is such [UNCLEAR-apologetic] condition, in which i have come. It is a very funny situation that I have coming. I know that. The other day I went to see a very influential indian man, of course he knows me, because of my husband, may be, that he knows that a person of that status may not come to this level of cheating others-whatever it is. But still it all be, that he can’t understand, how people are taking to this horrible gurus and how these gurus came and cheated me also.And I helped them. Now, I would say, that in Sahaja Yoga, it is a spontaneous happening, a living happening. You are a living being and the force of God is also living, just like a fruit comes out of a flower. Just like this living process takes place, you become your Spirit. We never think this thing is around us , every day we see. This is worked out by this all pervading Power. We can’t do even with one flower.We cannot transfer even one flower into a fruit! We take it for granted.We never know that all this living things are there. Now look at it! There is a little bird, which lays the egg-for what? The eggs are kept in the nest. The all pervading Power works it out in such a way that the eggs grow and the bird hatches them and out of these eggs comes out a bird. A bird! We have seen caterpillar turning into butterfly.We never thin how it happens. We just take it for granted! We enjoy their colors, you see, we never see how this transformation has taken place and it starts mutation has taken place. In sanskrit language a realized souls called as [0672-00:01:42-UNCLEAR-VIJAHA-?] is the one who is born twice, of course, this is also another problem. Last time i said you are to be born actually again. It is a living process. The Kundalini has to move throughout the centers and you have to feel the actualization of your Realization, means you must feel the cool breeze coming out of your fontanelle bone area. Realization you have to feel. It is Actualization. It is not w vague believe I told them hundred times. And they were taping me. Some people told me :” Mother, don’t allow them to tape”. I said:”Let them tape! What’s the matter? I am not running any enterprise!-[UNCLEAR-0672-00:02:25]. They said:”No, they will use it for some purpose!”. I said:” Let them use it! For what purpose they use I don’t understand”. I don’t understand which human laws. You know i am very bad at it! and human beings i am also worse. These people met me the other day in Sydney after so many years. They are branded themselves as born again. And they just sell certificate that we are born again, we are born again. I said :"But how?”. But We are born again.But what is the proof that you are born again, my children? What’s the proof? How do you believe you are born again? There must be some proof of it. Oh, we are born again. Finished.Now, you cannot self certify yourself! It you do that, it is Ego-understand that.If you are born again, you should be able to feel the centers of other people, you should be able to feel your own centers, you should be able to judge yourself and cure yourself and you could cure others, not only that, but you could raise their Kundalini and give them Realization. This is the minimum of minimum to that! I am in an egg if it is starting, i am a bird. Does it become? It’s an egg in an egg, isn’t it? If it’s over, I am a bird. It can fly.It have to really fly! If you tell the egg:”You are still the egg, will you please fly?” Some of the nicest rhymes are Humpty Dumpty sat on the wall, you see.That’s what they are! They believe that we are great people, they sat on the wall and when they fell down, all the King’s horses and all the King’s men….[00:04:28_0672 UNCLEAR] .. to them together. Again, this is what it is-is a make believe that we are born again. But what’s the use? What’s the use? You see, It’s of no use to you! You are Seekers out and out you are Seekers! You are nothing, but Seekers of Spirit! Accept that situation! First of all, except Your Self! These all certificates are not going to help you, by any chance! Again you go away, you find another Guru, get after him, get after another, get after another and some of them are just turned them into Lunatic Asylymn, I don’t know what to do with them? When this happens to you, physically you feel all right. I mean cancers can only be cured through your Kundalini awakening, i’ve been saying this for the last ten years! I will so cure cancer automatically off people as a by product.All diseases get cured-that is minimum of minimum that should happen to you! After all Realization is not some sort of a cheap thing you can buy in the market, like a take away food.It is Your Spirit, which is an internal Being, which you achieve!. You achieve your absolute value!You become that! Though it happens so spontaneously, so easily that you can’t believe. Now you have no sensitivity, you can’t believe it that you got it really in the beginning-People just don’t believe it-ask him(?). It is important, but they can’t believe it that this is happened. And when they don’t believe it, they don’t want to practice it any further. It’s so surprising. First,you have to get the sprouting of Kundalini and then you have to allow it to grow and once you grow into it- then you are like a tree.As Gregoire says it’s true. You see, He worked here in Santa Cruz, went to Berkeley, then he met another very good Sahaja Yogi from India and just came down to London. That time i saw him and i said:” Look at that Seeker coming down. I went to receive him at the station and i was surprised, he was so frantic, he was so upset and i was surprised that the centers he[…0168/00:06:57..]….. He is a Seeker, i know that! That’s such love, such feeling. I said: “ Look at this my child, were you lost? What happened to you?” Now, we have to know what we are, what we have to achieve and where we are to? That’s an important thing. As i have told you, you must know-what you have to achieve? what to get? In a very gross way, i tell you, actually, it is so dynamic, it is so dynamic, it is so fantastic that if i tell you any more stories of it, you’d say [……0168/00:07:33….] story. But there is God. He is there, no doubt and He is dynamic and He is All Powerful and that His All Love and He loves you so much that he wants you to enjoy His Kingdom! It’s true, no doubt about it -00:07:51. I am here to prove everything to you.Not to talk and give sermons and all that, but to prove it to you! And his Powers are so fantastic, so fantastic, at every level how they work out is amazing! You have to just become! Becoming is the main thing. Just you become. Now, as far as I am concerned, i am Your Mother. You have every right, every right on me. I should say I am your …[00:08:29..].., because I am here only to connect you to your Self and you become your own Guru, you don’t need Guru any more. Once you are connected to the Mains you become your own Guru.You know Dhis, Dr. Warren Dhis(?). He came to me and I had to stick on to him, because he was all the time running away. He has been to so many Gurus who pampered his ego-this this-oh, you are great chikka, you are great, you are this, you are already a realized soul, you see, all this things chikka went over his head and it was very difficult to sit to get him together and also, do not work in the city. I actually work in the villages of India, where really thousands of people have got Realization and since that six thousand people got their Self Realization at a time. But Indians are wise, wise people and they are the people who do not enter into extremes. In the seeking they are also wise, they know what to expect. So, it is easy for them, for me to work out. They are innocent people still not exposed to these , sort of, what you call, material exposure that you have. Thought you denied it, but to […00:09:43].. your brain is modern. You may like to look like primitive people, the brain is modern-what can you do? Thinks and think and think. Just by changing your brain, you cannot become that-see- this is the point we should know. So, it’s easy there to work it out and in the villages, indian villages, you don’t even get sometimes a car to move up you get a bullock cart and this to go to bathroom, you go to the river. I mean, lots of things are there. It’s all right for a change or holiday, but when you have to be with me three months like that, it was too much for him. But still he managed and now, now you will be amazed , he has established seven centers in Australia in seven cities! If you ask him, how many people he has given Realization, he would say-I don’t remember. SO, one light which has been enlighten, can enlighten another light. But the first light has to be an enlighten light. Now, once you say you are enlightened, everybody’s ego starts coming up. I tell you, it is very common with the western people. Every time i went to some places -why you are for all these things, Mother? I said:” Now, it is all right. You come along-it’s a good idea. I would send to ..[00:10:56]… I said , my husband would pay a man who can do a job, it’s a thankless job to work for this together and day, nights together and he will be very happy to do that for you. Can you come down here?It’s all right, he finds it difficult to sit down, it’s too much, for some people. You have to be comfortable. (Mother addressing Audience):” You can come down, there is a room here”. You must to help. Now, this problem of becoming is not yours, is mine, for the time being. When you become that, then it is yours. Like, one side know how to swim. I can save you, if do not know how to swim-how can i make you swim? When you learn how to swim, you can also save other people-it’s very simple. But even if you say, it is saving, people get affected.Now, it’s becoming, it’s what you are. To get to that is the point. I would like, in general to tell you what we are and what is going to happen to us,when we become realized souls, is a gross manifestation of the powers, i told you. I mean, when you became human beings, you got your awareness in a different way than the animals have, because for the animals, for example, they do not understand the beauty of this room, for example, they won’t. They don’t anything that is filthy or dirty, they have no smell power, somehow they managed, they can live under any circumstances without smelling anything. Now, we don’t have to learn anything from animals. AT the first outset i must tell you, we don’t have to learn, we are on top of all the solution and we have to assume our position. Once we have assumed our position, you become that and once you become that, then you are amazed, how fantastic you are! That is the discovery you have to have!- 00:01:37 Now, within ourselves-I think all of you got this unique discovery so is easy for you to see what i have about to say. Now you will be amazed this lecture i gave about ten years back in India to begin with after there have been many lectures. But if you have this is a good idea, go home and see for yourself. But you also have a little pamphlet. If you can turn hat pamphlet, the back size is the complete picture of the Kundalini. (Mother talks to a Yogi)

Now, this is, we can say is the God, the Primordial Being, who has made you in His own image. But still his reflector, the human being is not complete. Within us lies this settle mechanism, which is called actually the (….0674..00:00:30…) This is the real (…..), holy (….), auspicious thing is, which gives us righteousness. You see, when we think of the Tantrikas, they are the worst ones-they make money, they do all kinds of violence, they teach all kinds of nonsensical things. I mean they are indulging to any kind of sex. They use your women, they use your money, they do all kinds of things.Now, I must say, this is the holy mechanism, this is the pure mechanism, is the purity, is completely pure love, is not biased. This mechanism existed in you and expresses itself outside in he gross also to a great extend. Thus it expresses itself as, on the left hand side as you see is the power of your Desire(UNCLEAR HINDI TERM), this expresses itself within us as our emotions and out phsycho, as they call it. Gregoire rightly said that Freud was quite half baked, because he knew only one part of the human being (UNCLEAR…..00:01:59) Because all the scientists see these things from outside. If you see a tree from outside, you could see there is something wrong with the leaf, you try to (UNCLEAR….) the leaf! But how to treat the whole tree is through the roots. So, you go to the roots of your being! And t And these are the roots.So you go to the roots of your bring.and these are the roots, one side of it is the Power of Desire and it works out after the first center. I’ll be telling you tomorrow morning about these centers. The another power is the power of action, it incas your Desire, which works out your Desire. This yellow color. Now , this gives you your future to enter into your future by your planning, by your thinking or working out. The left side gives you your past. It goes on accumulating on your left hand side and the deeper you move on the left hand side there is a collective subconscious. First the subconscious and the the collective subconscious. Now this is very important to know that when we indulge too much into the left subconscious, that is a very dangerous situation, as well as you move into your right hand side, the supra conscious and then to the collective supraconscius is a very dangerous situation. Moving into the left and the right is the easy thing foreman beings to do. Because if you want to do something, if you try to do something about it and if you are not spontaneous, what happens? that your sympathetic nervous system, which is governed by this subtle energy, goes into action and moves into the left side or into the right side. For example, if you want to run, as many people are just running, just some limit to things also. You can run once in a while, but all the time running-what is the need? Human beings are delicate things, I mean the way we go like a bull in a China shop. That’s not necessary. The way you ruin yourself also, because you think your body is your own[….UNCLEAR…00:04:34..] restrictive. This is the Temple of God! So, when you start overdoing something on the left or the right side, say some people are crying, weeping, singing praise of that and all that, some people say they must suffer, then you suffer […..UNCLEAR…] on the top of your head. If you want more, you can have them, any number. There are already so many coming to make you suffer. There is no need for you to suffer! Somebody has suffered for you, once for all.There is no need for you to suffer any more! You just need to enter into the Kingdom of God.So, if you try to go too much on the lefthand side or too much on the righthand side, you feel that you have got into [….UNCLEAR…] you have not! For example, take a simple things like LSD munity. Now, , what happens when you take LSD? When you take LSD, you move to the right-you start seeing the lights, you start seeing the eyes and all that.Is the movement on the righthand side. Actually, you push your Ego to the righthand side and you start seeing it.And once you see that you do not become anything, you just see it.Seeing it is not becoming, you have to become. And once you start seeing it, you think you have become a higher personality-it is absolutely no. You are under the domain, under the control of something else. You are not yourself. You [UNCLEAR…] the Supraconscious to see ideal, we can say the last work on the collective supra conscious was Hitler. He got lost completely. He didn’t even use, i mean, he was using tantrikas, so called tantrikas in horrible people, those who called themselves tantrikas and then he was using all that knowledge, so called, how to use these forces. The forces come to you through Dead Spirits, who are very, very powerful in the lifetime and those who are not give up that idea of domination and they are on this earth still all around. On the left side are the people who indulge to other kind of things, we can say, other-alcoholics and other things…..[UNCLEAR….] all these things, under which you become absolutely, sort of all the time crying, weeping-this that. In that you see your part-is a good idea in a way,but bad idea also in a way, because you are in the present, not in your past. Past does not exist any more, it’s finished now. What exist is the present. Either you are in the future or in the past and when you go too much into it identifying everything -this is what is the Truth, which is not. I will tell you that it is not.What is the Truth is your Spirit.That is in your evolutionary process has to little bit trigger it and that’s how you become and when you become-what happens to you? You are not start jumping, no you stop, anyone can jump. Is it difficult to jump? Some people who said we went for a flight. They paid 3000 Pounds to fly, i mean why? WhaIt is the need? I mean-you don’t want to become birds or frogs, do you? And they were nothing but frogs jumping. In my presence they were jumping like that. I did not know how to control! And they paid 3000 pounds for that.Yesterday in the plane I had someone from that kind of [UNCLEAR] and he was all the time doing like this because I was sitting there.”I think I better go from there to the back”.

You are not in your own control! You have to be your own Master, now you must know, that you should be able to control yourself is the main point. Like in a car, these two powers , we can just as a symbol, I’ll tell you, can we compare as one is a break and the other is accelerator. First, you have to know how to drive, all right, so you are sitting and first you are going into a ditch then you getting out trying to balance it, then you know how to drive. When do you know, when you know, if you are asking ‘Mother, when do we know how to drive? I mean when we know-it is amazing simple thing. So, now you have managed…[UNCLEAR..]. First, you made accident and all mistakes, then this side….[UNCLEAR…] As long as you know how to drive-finished! So,first you have a driving license, then you start arranging these two things to keep yourself into balance. When you come into balance, still you are not the Master of the car, but you are master as far as the mechanism is concerned.So, where is the Master who is sitting of the car and of you. So, in the beginning you should be Master of your body, Master of your [UNCLEAR….].Then, what happens , that you become the Master of the car as well. So, first you balance yourself in such a way that you will master your body, your mind snd everything .And then you become that by which you are master other people also. But Master does not mean domination. Now, it’s a wrong idea, that Master is a person who dominates, it comes from where i don’t know. Master is one who loves, he really does.He may just sometimes, tell you don’t do this, because it’s wrong, you see, the whole bad thing happening, he may tell you. But she is a Comforter he said. She is a Comforter. Comforter, because you do not have no love in your life. The real love you have not felt…..[_0674_UNCLEAR] at love, he is a comforter is a left side. In our Sahaja Yoga language we call the Comforter as Mahakali. She is the Holy Ghost. From that Comforter other aspects come up. The second aspect is what you call [Interconfinent-?_0674_00:11:10_UNCLEAR]..The one who tells you

what is what ,echoes everything, tells you how to manage, hot to go ahead, like an instructor and you are verifying that and the third..The second one in our Sahaja Yoga, the thing is called Mahasaraswati and the third one is the Redeemer, the one who redeems, who gives Marsha…. [UNCLEAR_00:11:45]…is called as Mahalaxmi. These are the three powers which exist within us, the first keep on manifest the Left Sympathetic, the second one manifest the Right Sympathetic and the third one gives you the Parasympathetic, which controls these two centers which coordinates, cooperates and refills , but it is still a limited amount of energy. Now, some people tell me that we went to a person and we felt energy. What sort of an energy do we feel? Very much like shaking and all that. No, that’s not good. If you are not possessed you should not shake before a person.On the contrary you start feeling the cool breeze in the hands.You feel comfortable relaxed. How do you know, you see what happens through Sahaja Yoga is the way is very good you should see for yourself.Get 3 people-one from lunatic asylum , certified mad, who is a certified. Get another one who is not realized and get the third one who is realized.. They sit down. Now you ask them to put their hands towards you. Now the person who is mad be doing like this. Now if there a cancer patient, he will be emitting tremendous, tremendous heat, so much that you don’t need heater even in London in December or January.If there is someone like that , you don’t need any. But supposing that person is just a normal person {UNCLEAR] person just in the center, he starts feeling the cool breeze and the realized soul starts feeling the whole thing coming on.So, this is what you have to judge with people when they come , you should know what happens to that. Now, if you are seeking reality, you must know that you have to face yourself as you are today. We don’t try to hide anything, because you are sitting in front of your Mother. I don’t care what you have done. I [UNCLEAR_00:14:19] not necessary. The first mantra in Sahaja Yoga is to be said is that Mother, I am not guilty. You have to say that 16 times in your heart that ‘Mother, I am not guilty’. This is the first mantra of Sahaja Yoga, because you in yourself, you see, the whole thing [UNCLEAR…0674…00:14:41..] into a defidence in your life. Even the Ego sometimes gets hurt. When you do mistakes or anything, it gets hurt and when it gets hurt you get diffident, so it is but up within you as diffident. So, when you say ‘Mother, I am not guilty, your self-esteem is established. First, you’d better establish your self-esteem.SO, now I am here to tell you, within you lies Power of Kundalini. I was very happy to know that people have reached the conclusion that it is the Kundalini awakening, which is going to do the job. It is a very good conclusion you have reached. But any big Tom and Harry cannot do it. One should know that. Say it is a sprouting, it is a living process. Now, logically you should approach the subject You are all very intelligent people, I can see that. You are not stupid people, try to understand.Now, living things. like sprouting the seed. If you want to sprout a seed, can you pull it out? or you should stand on your head-will it happen? They are [UNCLEAR..] things. (Mother talks to a child:” Hello!. What is it?. All right, sit down now. Would you sit down for a while? Thanks very much) The y are realized souls. They are born realized. So many children born realized, do you know that? So many children are born realized and if you are not [ UNCLEAR]. You have to know what are they. They know me better than you, people and they are going to come up very spontaneously. They are going to create that beautiful mansion of love for you. All right. So, this Kundalini is the Power within us. What Power is this? This is the Power of Primordial desire within us. This is Primordial Desire within us to be one with the Divine, to be united with the Divine and [UNCLEAR} Yoga and rest of it is not. Yoga is nothing [UNCLEAR] you are to be connected with the Divine , is the york. All right. If that is so, this desire is not yet manifested. So, it is called as a sleeping Kundalini and only the person who has that or Mother Earth can do it, as simple as that. Everyone, who thinks that Kundalini is to be awakened, must know it is spontaneous, living happening, just like a sprouting of a seed-you cannot just pull it out. It cannot be done by any effort, is spontaneous. I mean, if it is evolutionary. Logically , we can find out, we did nothing to become human beings from amoeba stage or from , say,we didn’t cut our tails to become human beings, did we? We din’t do anything. It just happened so spontaneously. But where is the change in us, lets see [UNCLEAR] logically. Not rationality, but logically. Rationality could be quite mad.Logically you should understand, what is the difference we have got is in our awareness. So, something has to happen in awareness, not in a way that you just start jumping or taking out your clothes and nonsensical thing. If you, [UNCLEAR] what so great? I just can’t. But you can see with a naked eye the pulsation of the Kundalini, not in all. If you are a first class instrument, it just happens, like that. Like a jet. It’s a jet Kundalini in a jet age. It is. It has to happen to all of you.Now, why some people said you have to do so much and you have to do like this and you have to do that and you have to cleanse yourself and only you’ll get realization. Why is it so simple to get? The reason is the time has come. In the beginning of tree’s life one or two flowers come in, but now the blossom time has come, so many seekers i see before me, just like flowers, who want to become the fruits. There have been no such seekers before in the West whatever [UNCLEAR] modern time. This is the outcome of that. Without this chaos there would have been no [UNCLEAR…0674_00:20:09…] This is the time that has been predicted that many saints should be born at this time.

[UNCLEAR..} imagine thousands years back it was written. When this Kali Yuga, this modern time, the one who is who creates the Kali, he was caught up by somebody and he said that Nala he said what do mean by torchering me and my wife like this [UNCLEAR…] SO the Kali said :’ Alright, you can tell me, but you have to find out one thing about me. You must know what I am and what i represent. What are you just tell me. He said: When the modern times will come , we call it as Kali Yuga, at this time, these saints who are seeking God in the hIlls of Himmalaya will be born as ordinary householders and they are going to receive the blessings that have been already promised.If so, that happening have to take place. But as soon as people came to know that people are seeking, the market got jammed. and you got into a trap.It is our all enterprises , take it from me. Even holiday is an enterprise. It is very subtle matter of making money out of you. Now, i think , most of them are getting little light, because all their advertising and all that is a little bit fading and they don’t know how to find out who [UNCLEAR] of advertising. These people are not interested in indian villages, they are not!. They are interested in Los Angeles or in Santa Cruz, where they can collect that money. It is an enterprise. You cannot sell God, can you? You cannot organize it. Some lady paid $4000 very recently and i heard somebody told me that she went there, she danced, she took of her clothes,became mad and came back. You pay to go to lunatic assylim only.

[UNCLEAR…] Everybody is going. ‘Oh, i’ve been there to that Guru’. It is so madding! [UNCLEAR] You must understand-you are the new forms of [UNCLEAR] wives. In older days, you see,people who donate towards church were regarded very religious, like, even now i think some of the Jews stay [UNCLEAR] diamond jewels bible [UNCLEAR….0674..00:23:10 ]they show it nicely that they have got one. All these [UNCLEAR] of God you better give up, because you are not followers, you are seekers.Let them [UNCLEAR] with that nonsense. But you are seekers , so you take to the Truth and you become that. I think today, it’s quite a lot for you. I would like you to ask me something, but sensible questions, don’t be aggressive with me. I am very clever , as they told me, ’She is the Masterpiece of camoflouge-it is true! I am, so be careful! If you have any real questions of me , if you are not a true seeker and you just try to show off, you are cheating yourself-don’t try to show off. I read this book, i read that book, this happened, what do you think of this Guru-don’t bring me the controversy, unnecessary. If they would be of any value, you would have been a realized soul! I can make up from you who was your Guru, even that the way they are ruining your Kundalini. Some of the Kundalinis are so ruined, i see them just like wounded, wound, what you should say , wounded [UNCLEAR}. It is so bleedy. [UNCLEAR….]. No doubt about this cruel people. If i start blasting them, you’ll be amazed!, how they are.. I love you very much, but i don’t love them, i am wrathful, very angry with them, because they are devils, satan, if they wanted money, they could have smuggled, so all right,they could have done something like that, but they they should not have ruined Kundalini, they have no business to do it. They will go to hell, no doubt, but they will be caring so many with them, they know that. They are trying to overpower the Anti-Christ. They think they can [UNCLEAR] of God, but they not know that God’s Power are so powerful [UNCLEAR].. in one stroke, the only thing why they are not destroyed, because today they are in your brains![UNCLEAR}.. Krishna have said:'Whenever there is the Fall of Dharma, Fall of Human Values and Virtues, whenever [UNCLEAR] suffer, I come on this Earth to save the Saints and kill the Devils. But the Devils have got into the Saints. It’s a problem [UNCLEAR] for me. I don’t know what to do. These devils have come into your brain. They are to be taken off, first of all.{UNCLEAR}. Do not stick on to one question, if you stick on, you miss the whole point, all right? By questioning, you will not get your Realization. I tell you, it’s not a mental activity, it is beyond. It is triggering beyond the mental activity.This lecture is useless if you do not get your self-realization. In the beginning of the days there have been written that if you do not give them knowledge [UNCLEAR} going mad, all right. Does mean [UNCLEAR], if you do not feel the all pervading Power,then these Vedas are useless, in the same way my lecture and all mental activities are useless, if you do not get your Realization-that’s the main thing you must have. May God bless you! Now, ask me a question.

-What is the best approach we can take to go to Laxmi?

I will tell you tomorrow , Laxmi where she is settled down, all right? That’s what you are going to do, all the Goddess, not one. All in one bundle! [UNCLEAR…0674_00:27:00]

[0675-Beginning] All right, doesn’t matter, we are going to workout out. Now, don’t worry about your personality. It is always working out en masse, as you call it. Don’t worry about your personality, just don’t worry. There is nothing to worry. It is going to work out. It is a working out, i am saying. All right?

Yes (Seeker is asking a question). A Yogi: “She is asking whether you said to say “Mother, I am not guilty”.

Shri Mataji:”Yes, yes, please, within yourself!. Very important.

Shri Mataji: What is it?

A Yogi:”She is liking it!”

Shri Mataji:”Good, good! May God bless you!” Don’t feel guilty at all, all right? Otherwise I would not come here. The ones who have harmed you are guilty.

A question from Seeker and Yogi retells it to Shri Mataji: She is asking this question about your capacity and our capacity to hate the devils.Most religions preached that we should not be angry.

Shri Mataji: You should not be angry, but the Devils? You run away from them. Let me [UNCLEAR] you don’t worry about them. You just don’t worry about them, all right? You are signed off.

What’s the point-to love yourself, have self-esteem, know that you are temple of God,then you love by becoming their light, you become collectively conscious and again the becoming, again the word becoming . Then you start feeling the other within yourself, who is the other? I am not helping you, you are part and parcel of my being, if i am helping my finger, do i am helping you? All right, then we [UNCLEAR] the rest of your team You don’t worry about them.

A seeker asks a question and Yogi retells the question: Many of his people who come to his clinique have activated their Kundalini too early and he is wondering how to help them.

Shri Mataji: I will tell you on that.They do not activate their Kundalini, they do not. What they do, they activate your sympathetic. All these things are to activate the sympathetic and it is very dangerous. You can get blisters, you can get all kinds of problems. You can get , i mean , cancer also. I get so many people like that. I’ll tell you [UNCLEAR]. all right. It cannot harm. It’s your Mother. That’s the only Mother you have and she is, you are the only child. How can your Kundalini trouble you? She is just waiting for the moment to give you Realization.She loves you the most of all.And you can not activate it, it just spontaneously rises. [0166….00:00:03..UNCLEAR] amazed to read some books[UNCLEAR] people don’t know what Kundalini is. [UNCLEAR..}. They are cheach writing such big books about Kundalini, without knowing what, without any authority. You have to have Divine Authority, isn’t it? You cannot get in Theological college or any place you go- you cannot. Its a Divine Authority you must have.

A QUESTION: Should we love our enemies as well?

Shri Mataji: First of all you love yourself and your friends. Then we talk of enemies, all right? You have to know who are your enemies. Actually, you don’t know [UNCLEAR….0681_00:00:23]. First, you have to develop that discretion power and your vibrations you will know who is who, because ones you are connected wit the Mains, you start feeling You can ask a question, you can ask any question, which is[…UNCLEAR].We start feeling a cool breeze coming, like a computer, you become connected with the Mains [UNCLEAR…].Before that you don’t [UNCLEAR]

[UNCLEAR], very few.

Shri Mataji: Should we now get it?

[UNCLEAR]. Just leave one of the doors open, some of the enemies to fly out.

Thank you very much.

Yogi: If anyone has their shoes on, take them off and [UNCLEAR] put your hands towards Mataji and just ask[UNCLEAR]. Be humble about it. [UNCLEAR}

Shri Mataji: Sit comfortably. There is nothing [UNCLEAR]. Your neck should be neither bending nor [UNCLER]. There is no effort has to be put in it. Then sit comfortably. Kundalini will rise by itself and gives you Realization. You don’t have to do anything. Just don’t put your concentration into one point. You cannot control, i mean, some people have a habit of concentrating here and concentrating here. All those people who has done their concentration business or what is that the another one-what’s that other one that puts the tongue back [UNCLEAR]. But they don’t understand. It is some sort of [UNCLEAR] they said. [UNCLEAR] business. All these, whatever you have done, all these things, just keep , all such people should put their attention near not here. That’s all. But rest of the people just keep your attention absolutely loose, that’s all. Just keep your attention loose.

Now, close your eyes. Keep your eyes closed. Don’t open your eyes, because Kundalini has to pass through Agya chakra and if your eyes are not closed, she won’t rise. Put your hands towards me [UNCLEAR], just like this.Just like this. All of you, please, put your hands, because in your hands, you have those centers.I would be [UNCLEAR] take everything heavy in your neck. Please, take off-it is better. Also, if there is anything [UNCLEAR].

Just put your hands towards me.Close your eyes.

Please, put your [UNCLEAR], because Spirit resides in our heart. Right hand on your heart. Sit very comfortably without any strain on your back. That is very important.

[UNCLEAR]

Ask the question:” Mother, am I the Spirit?” Put your right hand on your heart.

I am requesting you to say:” I am not guilty. Mother, I am not guilty. Say before saying anything else. Say at least 8 times.”Mother, i am not guilty”. That is very important, because [UNCLEAR].

Just say that! [0633_00:00:34_UNCLEAR]..
