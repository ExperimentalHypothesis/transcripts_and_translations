(Introduction by Gregor)

I am very fortunate and very happy that I could come to Sant Cruz. 
I can see what I am facing is the Ocean of Love, the seekers of Love, the people who are seeking the Truth. 
Gregor has told you all these things, because he is very earnest, he is very concerned, he knows you are seekers and this is why he has told you in these words, so don't be frightened, there is nothing to be frightened about that.
You are seekers and you are a special category. In the eyes of God, seekers are the highest creation that He has created. You are the highest of all. To Him it does not matter who are rich, who are in power, who is leading a life of so-called success; it does not matter to Him at all, He does not understand that, He does not know that. 
Christ has said that these people if they want gold let them have; they have bars of gold and leave with it. But "If they seek Me, if they love Me", then these people who are seekers today are going to enter into the Kindom of God and He will eat with them, they will seat at the same table. 
You are respected because you are seekers; you are loved, because you are seekers. And you have survived despite all the attacks on you, these are all attacks. You are [..], you are simple, you were innocent at that time when attacks came in.
Now gradually you are discovering that it was an attack. Everything, everything that you did was just to put you down. 
And one person who was negative of that kind would come forward and assert and use all the negative forces to push you down.

To Me you are My children. To Me, I do not think what you have done, because you did not meet Me that time. I take the load upon Myself.
I did come to [..] last time, they said "There are a lot of seekers settling down in Santa Cruz", they did tell.
I wanted to come and see you here that time only, but the experience I had of the people who were there, I thought "They are not just seeking God, but they are seeking ego or superego", sort of seeking into a new style of life, a new style of understanding, because they have found out that material life is of no value, is not going to give them joy.
At that time, when I said that you are thinking all these things how can you pay for it? And nobody could understand these things, it was very difficult to talk to them, that "It is spontaneous, that it is your own right that you have to get it. You have been seeking for ages now, not only in this life time. You have been saints in many lives and now you are born here to seek it". 
It is so simple as that, it has to happen, it is your nature, that's what you are; you try anything else, you won't be satisfied till you found out the Truth.
But that time nobody would listen to Me, it was a very funny situation and I ultimately decided that let them find for themselves to begin with. When they will find it out, they have to reach the right conclusion. Because there is one problem in the seeking, that you have to seek in your own freedom, in your own glory of your own choice. Becaue if you are to be liberated, it has to be a free choice. A person is not free - he says - he isn't [..] or he is hypnotised or he is overpowered by others. He has not freedom at all of any kind, such person is useless to enter into the Kingdom of God. If you are to become the King, then you have to have that basic freedom in yourself [..]
But freedom does not mean ego by any chance, it never means ego. If you think: "I like it, I love it, I do it", that is not the Spirit. You are not seekers of ego, I must tell you very frankly, you are not, you are seekers of Truth, of Love, of Joy. For ages you have been seeking that, joy is the result. When you get to that position where you become your Spirit, your Atma, you should be in joy, not... telling about it, not talking about it, but enjoying it. And that has to happen to you. It is a happening that you are built-in for ages now.

Today in general I will tell you what you are really and what you have to expect, to become what, nobody has told you about it. They said "All right, come to us into a new age"; "All right", people said "Let's go! Join it!". Somebody said that you will get this and you join it.
Willliam Blake - I must say - was one of the greatest prophets of modern times. For you, western people, he said that "The men of God" that is you people, you are people of God, you are not of this [gross] level. If people do not understand you that does not mean that I do not understand, I know you, what you are. I know what it is, I can feel it, I just feel that. He said that "Men of God will become prophets, and these prophets will have powers to make others prophets".
This is what we have to expect within ourselves.
(Don'r worry about her, she has a problem here [Shri Mataji indicates the centre heart]. She will be all right)
So you have to become the prophet and you have to make others prophets. Now this is the point you should judge: have you become the prophet? what is a prophet? Prophet is a person who can feel the all-parveding power around.
Now I said that there is all-pervading power of Love, I say that. Oh you also sing the song, they say "Yes, there is all-pervading power". Many people also feel that they are feeling it, but it is not true. We have to be honest to ourselves because we are seekers, we should not cheat ourselves; because this is ego that makes you cheat. This intelligence is the worse thing. Gregor himself told me one day that "I find my intelligence is trying to cheat me". Very intelligent way.
So one has to be very careful to understand that you have to become that. You are the loser, you are the loser. Nobody else.
If you play around with your ego, you are the loser. Or with your superego, your conditionings, mesmerism, hypnosis, or your ideas of having a kind of life... all that. Could be a great barrier to be the Spirit, which is a different thing... all together is beyond this.

So when you become the Spirit, what happens to you, what should you except? Of corse it is true that there is this power around us, this all-parveding power is there.
Now if I say there are lots of plays going on here, there is music going on here, everything is there, you won't believe, If I bring the television and say "This is the one which is going to show you", you will say "Oh"; I mean, you know it, but in India, if I take to a village who has never seen a television, will say "This box?". How can I do it? But you put it into the mains and a fantastic thing can happen, it catches all that.
In the same way, when you become that, when you get.. just it is little breaktrhough, is just the plugging into the mains, just that, you are all ready for that, just that. And a fantastic thing happens. First you start feeling it all around, first thing. Now not jump into ego then, that's not the end of it. You first start feeling it around.
Then you start understanding that your centres are on your fingers 30:32
