The whole creation of God is Sahaja and the ultimate is the Sahaj Yogs. God has crested man with His Shakti and he has to know Him and recogonise Him through Kunaalini awakening Blossom time has come and many ancient seekers are today getting their self realisation. My heartiest congratulations to all the Sahaja yogis for enlightening the path of self realisation for the seekers of truth.
