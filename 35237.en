Shri Mataji:Hello, This is the raga as called as 'Meeya ki Malhar'.' Meeya' is the person, very well known in the history of India. His name was 'Tansen' Actually I don't know what his real name was but this was a kind of an honour name given to him by Akbar the great Who ruled in our country. And he was a very cosmopolitan man. He had married a Hindu lady also Jodha Bai, and this Akbar also wrote Ainey Akbar which is something like -just like Sahaja Yoga. He tried to integrate all the religions and gives the best principle of the religions. This was the great work Akbar had done. Now he was alls so fond of Indian Music. He had Tansen in his [unclear/fort/court] where he looked after them. Formerly in a country, all the things used to look after the artists, musicians and all that. So this he made this special raga he is known for this raga 'Meeya ki Madhar ' and another one he has made which is the very famous one, ''Deepak' raga for that nowadays nobody plays which is the raga by which lights used to get enlightened like -You play that raga and It will have all the little lamps we use in Diwali... They used to get light up That was said about it. And When it did not rain he used to play this raga "Meeya ki Manhar" by which it used to rain and so It is a....become a seasonal song But very beautiful raga he enjoyed very much...I think you know some music and some of the bhajans are based on this. So I am sure you are going to enjoy this one...( After performance )Hello, I feel Tansen is reborn here again...And this time he surpasses his performances, this time he raised a little ...And we can say this now ...In our language, we say that if somebody is a very great player we say Tantor means absolutely the last word of all this...
