Talk to Brides, Ganapatipule (India), December 26th, 1999

On one [inaudible] is that, if you have accepted this marriage, you’ll have to make it a very successful and beautiful marriage. And as I told you that women are for the preservation, preservation of family, of their country, and preservation of all of the value system of Sahaja Yoga.

For that, you should be prepared. You may have to be [inaudible] sometimes hurt, sometimes people might try to say things to you which you may like, but you have to be very wise about it. Only the wisdom can help you that you are responsible for building up a good married life. And once you know that, you’ll understand the importance of your being married in Sahaja Yoga.

It’s not like any other marriage. It is not just a convenience or it’s not just matching for you. It’s much deeper than that. And if you have that feeling within you, that you have to have a very loving relationship. If you love somebody, you won’t grouch anything, you won’t demand anything, you won’t react for it.6:45You have to have love, you must excuse and forgive, if something is done wrong. After all, men are not that practical as women are, you know that. But you are their support. You are their help. And you have to look at it from a very different angle that you have to build up this married life yourself.

Sahaja Yogis are men who are all right here; they are Sahaja Yogis and they understand what is to be done. But your understanding should be much more, much deeper, then only it will work out. So, I have to tell you very, very frankly that if the marriage would fail, it will be because of you and not because of him. It is how you handle, how you behave, this thread [unsure] and what will support you and what will help you will be the loving attitude. Then you won’t mind anything because you love a person. You want to have a very loving family and loving children and everything is so beautiful. If you want to make yourself miserable, it’s very easy. But if you want to make people really much happier, very much respecting each other, for that you should show much more maturity than the men can do. Because it’s your responsibility. Marriage is mostly your responsibility. And how you make it is your own doing.

So, I have to tell you that at this very beautiful time, this auspicious time, when you are going to enter the married life is the first step and then for your children is the second step. In every way you should try to express your love, in every way possible. And all of you should develop a new technique of sahaj, how to express your love to them and to each other because we are all one family. And we have to show that we are, we are very conscious, aware of our responsibility because Sahaja Yoga is the only way we can resurrect people and save them.

Now, you have become part and parcel of the ocean and in the ocean, whatever is the way, you have to move with that. And this collective understanding should be there. There should be no problem on that thing. You’ll enjoy all the collective, you’ll enjoy all the love that collective wants to give.

I am sure you will make it. You look very promising to Me and I really bless you from my heart that you become a very good wife in Sahaja Yoga.

May God bless you
