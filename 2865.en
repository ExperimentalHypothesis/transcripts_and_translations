Makar Sankranti. Pratishtan (India), 2008.
Today is Sankranti. Sankranti means that today there is something new going to happen. Kundalini has awakened within you and you have become new person compared to what you were before. But on the day of Sankranti, you should know that you have to please the Goddess who is sitting within you. What should you do to make Her happy? You distributed sesame seeds and jaggery. That is for love. To increase the love between each other, we give sesame seeds and jaggery.

Today the Sun left its place and, in its northward movement, came towards us. At this moment we should be very thankful to the Sun. It is by the grace of the Sun that so many things take place in our country. We have to do namaskar to the Sun today and His power and His knowledge should come to us. I would say that all of you have become realized and vibrations are flowing through you. Now you should make use of these vibrations, establish the shakti within you, establish the peace within you and show the world that this power is within us and we have to acquire it. We have to nurture this, improve this with your good qualities and truthful speech.

Today is very special day because the Sun is particularly benevolent towards us on this day. And we should thank Him for all this.  You have received a lot, there is more to come and you will get much more. We should increase it. All of you did so many pujas to me.  I am surprise to know what you want from all these pujas?  I wish you become great Sahajayogis and[not clear] you bring people to good path in this world.  Teach them good living and let they experience the energy which is flowing inside them. I am very happy to see you all. So can we go now?
