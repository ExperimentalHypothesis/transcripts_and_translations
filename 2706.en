Ashtami Puja, Eighth day of Navaratri, Meudon, Paris (France), 30 September 1984.

Today is the eighth day of Navaratri, and it is great day for Sahaja Yogis because it is the most important time, period. That is, the seventh centre, we have crossed, and we are on the eighth centre. We need not think about the Goddess what She did on the eighth day, we have to think today what we have to do within ourselves.

After crossing the seventh day, after crossing the seventh chakra- that is the real ascent in your spiritual ascent. What are we to do on the eighth one?

It’s so Sahaja that today should be the Ashtami, because that is the day the Goddess killed so may evil doers, and devils and Rakshasas. She did it on Her own, alone. Now these evil forces are manifesting in human beings. They have spread out. They are within us. So we all have to fight those forces within us. The war is within ourselves, is not without. First when you ascend the seventh chakra and you are on the eighth step, you have to remember first you have to fight those forces within ourselves.

You are all very intelligent people; bit too intelligent sometimes. So whatever I say you may twist it, and may try to use it in your own intelligence. But it is not in your well-being. It is not for your ‘hita’, for your good. You want to use it because you think you are intelligent, and may be you do not know you are using it that way. And that is what one has to know that these forces are acting within us. They act through our intelligence, they act through our emotions, and they act through our physical being. So we have to be very careful.

When you ascend into Sahaja Yoga, we have to be very careful with our intelligence, because intelligence has capacity to cheat itself. And it will cheat us, nobody else. It is against us, against our own power. So we have to be alert and see for ourselves. So as soon as you enter onto the eighth step you should start seeing at yourself.

Now, for example, when I say the mantra is “I am my own Guru”, immediately the intelligence comes forward to render its services-freely. “Oh! I am my own Guru, why should I listen to anyone? Why should I listen to any leader? Why should I listen to anyone else who is elder, who understands Sahaja Yoga better? I am my own Guru!” It is the other way. Straightforward thing is: I am My own Guru. I have to correct myself. I have to use this instrument of light to correct myself.

Now the intelligence cheats again: “Mother said that if your feel vibrations, then it’s alright; and I am feeling the vibrations, I am alright”. – Again cheating. You are cheating yourself! What is the reason? The reason is very interesting. I’ve seen that ordinary human being - in the West specially - are very much against themselves. Like, I’ll give you an example: You tell somebody that if you have to go to the station, take this road and you’ll go straight to the station. But immediately he’ll say, “But the problem is that how can I go straight? My back is towards the station. If I walk straight I’ll go in the opposite direction”. Such stupid things! But they say it, all the time.

Now if you tell them that you can sell your car better if you go to Germany, for example; but they say, “There’s a problem, may be the Germans may start their war again. May be there is Hitler waiting for me, to kill me” --- Any fantastic problem, that you can’t think of, can come out of this modern brain. And you are amazed how this man is against himself all the time!

The whole built-up is like that because before realization you are absolutely disintegrated. Your heart is against your brain, and your brain is against your liver. This is the reason they have three types of wives; one is a love affair, one is a physical life and one a wife. They are so disintegrated that every cell can have a wife or can have a husband. The nose will want another thing, and the hands will do something else and tongue will say something else.

When I met the western people, I had to consult many dictionaries to understand why they behave in such a funny manner. They are all the time against themselves.

So after realization this habit becomes even subtler. So now they use Sahaja Yoga to act against Sahaja Yoga itself. Sahaja is simple, is straightforward. But they don’t want to have it in that way. They must always do it in such a way that it is absolutely Asahaja.

There was a fellow in my house who was suffering from left side problems. So I told him that you have to light a lamp and then take out all your badhas every night. And we had a big drum of oil in the house. – He did not eat any food, he did not sleep. He burnt all that oil in one week’s time. He made all the blankets black, all the wall black, and burnt all the curtains! When I came back after eight days, I said what have you been doing? –And he looked like a real bhoot! He said “I was driving out the bhoots.” I said now this is the limit! So he said, “Mother you told me”, I said, “thank god you did not take beacon light to burn the whole house!”

So I have to be very careful when I talk with you. Whenever I tell you one thing, I tell you the other side immediately, because I don’t want – if I tell you this side, you go to the other side, to the other extreme. So all this kind of this crazy madness, stupidness I’ve seen.

And today when I’m going to talk to you about discipline, I must tell you “Discipline has to be Sahaja”. Now what does that mean? – That is first of all “face yourself”. What I find, the western mind, because of its ego cannot discipline itself. If you tell them you have to discipline they think I’m creating a military out of you. In a way it ‘is’ a fight. It is a fight with yourself. But how will you fight if you have no discipline?

Now if I say, you have to get up in the morning, take your bath, and sit down for meditation; in a Sahaja way you have to tell yourself plainly, “Come along, now you have to get up in the morning”. In a Sahaja way; the way you turn your wheels in your car.

So what you do, is to, I think, the whole night you don’t sleep. May be this could be one extreme, is not to sleep. And get up at 2 O’clock, disturb the whole house-hold, fill your tub, and fill the whole house with water! And sit down in the water, and you get cold and sick. It is absurd! Why? – Because you want to show-off. Or may be you want to hurt yourself. Both things are wrong. Whatever has to be done has to be done in the most pleasurable way. Either you will not wash the dirt, or you will wash it such that all the cloth will be torn.

But today as I see the people—of France, specially, the French Sahaja Yogis, --I think the discipline is lacking. I’m quite surprised at it. The first thing it hits at is that you cannot manage within a limited amount,--I mean money-wise. It hits you at the money point. Like in the room there’s light, nobody will see that it is put off; there’s also a switch to be put off;--is a practical thing. I mean one must know. And the bill is going up for nothing at all. Is an irresponsibility, complete irresponsibility. That it is the money that will be spent, is just a waste; and for us it is important that we live within sensible means.

First I’ll be dealing with gross discipline. Now what happens, when somebody says why the light is on, immediately they become very abstract, they say “I’m the light”. Then you should not have lights at all, there’s no need to have light! Save all the electricity, all the light. You are the Sun, so you need not have any heating!

That is the way things are funny. One must understand that on the gross points we have to disciplined first....We are living in ‘France, not on Himalayas. So when you live in France, we have to correct ourselves living in France.

Now the second gross point is that there are many who are not working at all. Is a hippy style life. Or they work for two days or three days, and the rest of the time what do they do? They say we meditate. Means what?—they sleep and snore, that’s what. You don’t need 24 hours to meditate. You ‘must’ have jobs, all of you. Regular jobs. So many ladies I’m told don’t take jobs once they marry. They say “let the husband do job”. It’s very wrong. If you have the child, it’s alright, for the time being. You all must work every day. There is no day for when we can rest, really.

God created this world in six days and seventh day He rested. But the eighth day what did He do? –He started giving Realization; relentlessly. Working hard. Could you believe at this age of mine, within last 2 months how much I have traveled? Every night sleeping at about 2 O’clock, getting up at 5 O’clock: I went to America, came back from there, then throughout England, the whole month I was traveling—from north to south, east to west. Next month out to Switzerland, to Zermatt. Then to Austria, Munich. Then back to London. Had a Puja there. Again back to France. Again back to London. I’ve to change my house, pack up all the things, go back to India, go to Hong Kong, go to China, come back. Then look after your Ashrams in India. Six days. Again come back. And then to America...

That’s the thing your Mother is doing at this age. Last night we slept at 3.30. But then they told us it’s one hour earlier. So, we said all right one hour earlier. So, we slept at 2.30! But you have to make your body like that, so that it can stand all kinds of discomforts.

You know in Sahaja Yoga unemployment is not allowed; to take this money from the Government is not allowed. You’ll be surprised; in England we have maximum unemployment in the whole world, but there is no Sahaja Yogi is unemployed. Now you must all earn sufficiently to pay for your stay. Nobody should be parasite.

Now the young people who are no educated, who have no other job than that of a labour class—or we call it as the garbage cleaners—must take some sort of specialization, to some kind of a mastery, otherwise people think that Sahaja Yoga is a group of beggars. Beggars and unemployed and miserable people.

But you see, when you become your own Guru, you think that all the Gurus don’t work; their disciples have to do all the work. The Guru sits down in one place, you see, and the disciples look after. —But not your Guru! Your Guru has to work very hard. So you have to be in the same pattern as your Guru is.

And to hear that “nobody listens, you tell them anything they don’t do any work, they are lazy-lumps”—is very sad. Some people sometimes say that these are the set of lotus-eaters or some sort of a set of beggars or lepers who are suffering from horrible diseases.  Then I feel extremely insulted, you know. You are my children. How people are going to have respect for you, or for me, if you have no discipline?

For French I should say, they should take to “Mauna” means silence. Once they open out their lips, they just go on like a bird, I’ve seen: all the time chuck chuck chuck...You should exchange with English, who never talk, they need a bump on the head to talk. You ask them ten questions, and they would not say anything, they’ll just stare. These two extremes I can’t understand.

Now it’s better to keep quiet, or it is difficult for us to say something pleasant to others. So the first mantra should be, “mother teach us some nice things to say to others”. “what should I say nice tomorrow, or today—let’s say, today—when I get up. What should I say? What would give peace to others?”—But not so. Never. The mind thinks, now, in the morning I’m going to start with a big spoon, hitting everyone, “Get up, get up, get up”.

The discipline has to come from ‘within’ yourself. Nobody has to tell you. And when somebody tells, you feel hurt. So I don’t know how to tell all this that it goes in the heart and doesn’t remain somewhere in the air. The discipline of within is like fragrance of flower. It gives you complete freedom, and it gives complete freedom to others.

See, I would say, I have certain bad habits or good habits. Supposing I have a key, which is very gross thing: key. At any cost I will not put it here and there. I’ll put it at the right place. So, if the key is missing I’m sure it is lost by somebody else and not by me. I’m sure about it, because I know myself very well, I know myself very well, I cannot put it anywhere else. Are you sure about yourself? Because you are not disciplined, you are not sure.

Like I asked somebody “How are you”? .......................Confused. Now, what is that? Are you realized or not? ..................They’ve been very kind, you see, to me, they think.

Now the time is so short and you are going like this. What should I feel? So today is the day when your Mother took out the sword to kill all the enemies, and you have to kill the greatest enemy within yourself—is irresponsibility.

Funny ideas people use to justify their stupidity and their indiscipline. I know of a Sahaja Yogi who would never take a bath, --for a year at least. And he was reported to me. And when I asked him, why don’t you take bath, he said, “I’m detached”. So I said you go and live in Himalayas with this detachment, you see others are feeling attached. Other are feeling impossible to live with you.

You have to be kind to others. You have to neat and clean, is a very simple thing that I have to tell you now. All these are the signs of inner cleanliness.

So we come to the subtler side. And the subtler side of Sahaja Yoga is extremely simple. Is Compassion. Is Forgiveness. Is Love. But the greatest of all is the Service to God. We are doing the work of God. How can we be tired? The dynamic is flowing through us, that Compassion is so fulfilling, that love is so beautifying that how can we not do it?

We should run to do it. But have to know that this love has a “tremendous” urge within itself.

For example, if you love someone, if you have a child, how worried you are about that child, how much you work for that child. If the compassion is manifested, you will see the whole world is created out of that. God has created this universe, this world and you people out of this Compassion only, just His compassion.

Somebody asked me one day, “why did you take this headache upon yourself?” This headache is so nice, is such a beautiful burden, because there are so many possibilities. So one has to be optimistic.

But you will realize when you are optimistic, you give lectures to others but not to yourself that, “ ‘I’ have to optimistic of improving myself. Optimistic in my own love. It’s so rewarding, it’s so joy giving”. Such people come up very fast, their Kundalini rises very fast. They become beautiful people. They do constructive work in Sahaja Yoga. They do not create rifts and groups. They don’t use Sahaja Yoga for fulfilling their ego.............

So today on this day of Ashtami, which is a very powerful day, you assume that power within yourself that I can fight all these horrible diseases within myself. And for others I will have Compassion and Love— I will have not other. This is the point we miss always. They think “Mother is giving lectures to others not to me.”-

And that Compassion will bring forth the beauty of Sahaja Yoga.

There are certain divine laws. And you cannot cross them. If you cross them, I cannot help you at all. Now if you say, “Now I put chillies in my eyes, they should not burn”, I can’t help you. Whatever are divine laws you must follow them.

Like in France, if you drive on the right side, you’ll jump in the river .... You drive right? I see. So here if you drive left, I will be in trouble, I must say! Because I don’t understand human laws so well! Like in England different law, in France another law, in America another law. Funny people.

But in God’s realm, everywhere the same law. Whether you are in France, or England, or India, same law. Whether on this earth or on the moon, or on the Jupiter, same laws. Whether in human beings, animals or nature, same law. But you know the law. You are the driver, so you have to be careful. If the driver does not know driving laws, God save passengers.

So, one must know that these are the laws of the divine, that we have to live with self-respect, that we have to be chaste, that we have to have dignity, that we cannot steal money and steal things and be parasites. That we cannot kill others and we cannot beat others and say harsh things, they are just the same. And that we have respect, the respect for all that is sublime. Respect for all the saints that are Sahaja Yogis. And the respect for the leaders who represent you Mother. With all this, we are very different people. We are different race. We are virtuous, we are righteous and we are proud to be that way. We are sure of everything. We know about every thing. And we are personification of Compassion, of Love of God. That’s what we are. We are not ordinary people.

I asked a child, “Who is our friend?” She said, “Only one”. I said, “Why?” “Because she is a Sahaja Yogini, the rest are all ordinary people”. What about the teacher?  “Very ordinary”. And what about your Headmistress? “She is absolutely ordinary!”

Then I showed her the photograph of the Prime Minister. She looked at it and she was quite surprised. She said, “this one is even more ordinary than my headmistress”. She said with great, you see, disgust, “Mother why do you keep such photographs with you?” That’s what we are. The children understand more than us, is it? Because our brain is against us perhaps, sometime; over developed brain. So, yesterday I saw many people having Ekadasha, I was surprised. So, I told them just say, “Mother You be in my head”. Because I have no intelligence. I’m too simple. You should all become simple like Me. Absolutely simple person. That’s very effective!I must say, yesterday I was a little surprised that there were two ladies that were very emotionally disturbed. And rather dangerously disturbed. I would like to meet them after the program. 

Now I think I have covered most of the points. But if you have any question, you can ask them today.

Sahaja Yogi: Shri Mother, we feel the same chakras, more on legs than on the fingers.Shri Mataji: The integration is not there, that’s why. You have to attend collectively. You have to be more collective; the body has to be collective. The thing is that if you are not a collective person then sometimes you’ll not feel them on the legs, sometimes on the hand, sometimes in the head. That’s not a good thing. You should try to be more collective, you should meet more people, take more interest. You see, the body of yours won't work out efficiently unless and until you use it. Because individually, you see, if you work out, it will not develop collectively, because where are you using it? You are correcting your self to give it to others. And if you don’t give it, if you do not work it out in a collective way, there is no circulation. For example, there’s a, say, a fruit is there and you take it out of a tree, and you mature it outside. But it will decay very soon. But if it is connected with the tree, it will mature by itself giving a proper identity to itself and to the tree. And taste would be better. And those who will come under that tree will receive the fruits of that tree. But a fruit which is separated will be lost after some time. That is how one has to very collective.

Sahaja Yogi: How to develop our discrimination, Mother?

Shri Mataji: Discrimination comes through Hamsa Chakra, more. And Hamsa is a very simple thing, is to put some ghee in the nose -- is the physical thing. On the emotional side, one should not cry too much. Or women specially have too much crying business. I also sometimes feel like crying, but seldom. So sometimes men must cry also.

Now spiritually, to develop discrimination is by vibratory awareness. When your vibrations are developed, then you automatically discriminate. You are such a big computer. It has to work in its full way, and then you’ll be amazed what a computer you are.

I’ll give you an example of Warren now. There was a - Pat’s husband Prole [David], who was measuring my house for certain purpose, while Warren was sleeping. Poor David was working, Warren was sleeping. And in his dream, he dreamt that he had finished with the last measurement. And in his half-sleep he got up and he told him that this house measures, how much?

Warren: Three thousand nine hundred and sixteen square feet.Shri Mataji: Three thousand nine hundred and sixteen square feet. And ‘exactly’ that’s what David Prole had written! Poor David had worked so hard measuring everything! He actually fell from his chair, you see, he couldn't sit![Laughter]

Like today I told Guido that I think I spent three hundred and eighty pounds. And he said, no it was three hundred. I never calculated, nothing. I just said it. And by calculation, it was 379, according to him - but I gave him one pound more! So it was 380.

It’s a fact! And that’s how you become a computer. All mathematics comes through your brain. It’s so dynamic. But first of all you have to have concentration of your devotion. Such a person achieves that. There are so many blessings waiting for all of you, to be manifested. Just you have to concentrate your efforts in devotion and dedication.

May God Bless You.

[Puja starts]

Shri Mataji: Now, who will do the puja? Now, take the things. Already the vibrations are so much, I don’t know after puja what will happen to Me. Already the flowers have started growing in size. You know, they are becoming big!All right.[A Sahaja Yogini gives a glass of water to Shri Mataji]That’s a wine glass, is it? Make Me really suck in all the wines of the world, that’s good idea.Shri Ganesha Atharva Shirsha you say and somebody has to wash. Somebody from France?

Thank you very much for sucking so many vibrations.So clear now.And today is the day, you see we said the eight things that came out Ahstami, amrut manthan, you see there was [inaudible] the eight things that came out. It is the eight jewel that came out of the Amrut Manthan because of the churning.[NO SOUND][Shri Mataji speaks about the churning of the Ocean, the mount Mandara was supported by Shri Visgnu as Kurma.]Shri Mataji: Lakshmi came out, many things came out. But the eight jewel that came out [no sound] the French Sahaja Yogis have decided to give Me because one of my weapons. I thank them for that. [A wip] With that, make the sound, somewhere, make the sound, go out.[Alexandre whips the air, applause]Now you must know this is a new style. 

May God bless.

Please, be seated. Somebody could tie this to the hands of people.Alexandre: Mother, could we tell them the signification of this signs here now?Shri Mataji: Yes, yes. It is now, it’s a bandhan, you see, on the Vishuddhi of the puja. But it should be taken out after 5, 6 days. [It’s a] protection, protection.Alexandre: Left or right Mother?Shri Mataji: Left.

[Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi] Now this one I ‘ll keep the water fulling vibrated with my own hands, you see, this one.

Shri Mataji: [Shri Mataji is cleansing her hands full of kumkum] This water should be used for the garden and things.Alexandre: Not drinking.Shri Mataji: Also, very good for the skin, the skin.Alexandre: Not drinking.Shri Mataji: For drinking there’s another water that I gave.Alexandre: Another water, Mother?Shri Mataji: This also can be used for drinking, but I would say because everybody put hands, they have put everything. I would say. Best thing would be to use it for the garden or for the skin. For the skin it’s very good.Alexandre: For skin problems.Shri Mataji: Skin. Anything, everybody’s skin you can give it.Alexandre: All right.Shri Mataji: For the skin, it’s very good.And I’ve given another water which is - that’s another one - which can be used for the garden.Alexandre: This one.Shri Mataji: No, another one.Alexandre: So, we can drink this one.Shri Mataji: This one is for the skin.That one can be used for the hair. This read one can be used for the hair. Hair and skin this one and that one for the garden. And the other one for drinking, for medicine. You all should take to your centers.Sahaja Yogi: For drinking, you want to rub it?Shri Mataji: For drinking, I’ve given, no?Sahaja Yogi: No.Shri Mataji: [Hindi] That is all! All right, you can have this one.Shri Mataji: Relax, relax.

Conversation after Puja [on the same spot]

Shri Mataji: Now, my idea was, as long as we have this place in Rouen, we all should try to have one seminar per month. At least, before going to India. So that you really discipline yourself. First of all, disciplining is necessary before you start any centre, or you start doing anything. If you are not disciplined, you can go into problems. You can create problems for others also.All right, then the second thing is, those who have to go to India must decide. French are the last to decide, you see, in this indecisiveness they lost Waterloo battle.[Laughter]Sahaja Yogi: [Inaudible] So you’d better hurry.Shri Mataji: Already? It’s already full the - and now you’d better do it. I mean that’s what I was wondering.Within this weeks’ time, you must put 100 pounds,100 dollars with you. 100 dollars. Now there is a very cheap flight, may be arranged, from Rome for 250 pounds. But you must decide now. [Shri Mataji laughs].

Americans have already decided, Australians have decided, English of course have decided, only the Italians have not given a full number and Austrians, not the full number. And the also, the full number is not given to us by the Swiss here.

But nobody has decided in France. I mean, that is a limit. At least in other places, there is no final but here nobody is decided. Ultimately nobody will have place there. And I want French to come in, I mean let’s see how many are coming from France. Lets look at that. You like to... alright such a big ....[Sahaj Yogis laugh] Already so many. One, two, three, four,five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, Oh my god, thirteen, forteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty, twenty one, twenty two, twenty three, (Sahaj Yogis laugh), twenty four. Twenty four. (A Sahaj Yogi remarks that we are too many and everybody laughs).

We have to manage some how. Give your names to Guido. Swiss people, Matiaz (SWISS YOGI’S NAME). Twenty four. We have got twenty four fast. (MOTHER SAYS SOMETHING THAT IS LOST BEHIND THE TRANSLATION.). This time is going to be rather spartan. But I am going to arrange it along the riverside now,all your tents. (SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT SOMETHING LOOSE).

[Mother] – You have to bring some loos here, some loos automatic ones ...

It’s a good idea, get ten”.[Sahaj Yogi] – “Get some ten”.[Mother] – “Make it twelve. We will leave them in India. Leave in India. Plastic? They are made out plastic and you have some sort of canvas around it?”[YOGIS CONVERSE AMONG THEMSELVES AND WITH MOTHER]

[Mother]- “We have to have some thing to hang otherwise how are you going to cover yourselves.(Laughs) Just find out how much it will cost, we would go buy it.”[Sahaj Yogi] – “French are the best in the world in portable loos”. [Every body laughs][Mother] – [INAUDIBLE][Sahaj Yogi] – “Shri Mataji, I have a gift as present to You. It is from Mary because she is leaving France now and we want her to establish the first contact.”[Mother] – “Where, where is she going?”[Sahaj Yogi] – “She is going to Switzerland.”

[Mother] – “Mary! Ah. Oh, I have to open it. Oh Beautiful, beautiful.[Sahaj Yogi] – “This is another one for our leader Alexander who is moving to Paris ashram”.[Mother] – “Thank you. Beautiful”.[Sahaj Yogi] – “Everybody from France has gathered money to make it.”

[Sahaj Yogi] – “Its very nice of my brothers and sisters to...[WORDS GET LOST IN CLAPS AGAIN][MOTHER DIRECTS SOME ONE TO GIVE ALL THE THREE TO PRAT INCLUDING A SARI.][Sahaj Yogi] – “Mother, can people come in and give you presents?”

[Mother] – “Alright, I mean my birthday is not there. Thank you very much, thank you. Oh beautiful flowers. Can you keep this some where? You have finished with the photographs or..”[Sahaj Yogi] – “Yes Mother.”[Mother] – “Ah, today Gustav have come. Clever. What a photo, I tell you Ashtami Puja...[ INAUDIBLE..] I mean just see the face , just like a goddess! Absolutely round and looking younger and younger, I must. I tell you, this one is too much, nobody will believe my age.”[Sahaj Yogi] – “That’s good.”[Mother] – “What happens, I don’t know.”

[Sahaj Yogi ]– “This camera is a special camera.”[Mother] – “Its too much... you see, just see this one.”[SOME INAUDIBLE CONVERSATION.][Mother] – “We better write down the dates. Even my hands have come out so small here. Surprising......Tremendous. From where it has come?”[Sahaj Yogi]- “Something with the chemical.”[Mother] – “For what? Beautiful photos. I must... Its tremendous. Just see the face. It seem like a moonlight face. It doesn’t look like human, it looks like a dog’s face.”[Sahaj Yogi]-[ INAUDIBLE]

[Mother] – “What is this? “[Sahaj Yogi]- [INAUDIBLE][Mother] – “Beautiful photographs, I must say. What have you got? You have to tell your name.”[Child] – [INAUDIBLE][Mother] – “Ah, thank you. Even in America also. So many presents, I have no place now, you will have to make a house for them.”

[A YOGI SHOWS MOTHER SOME INCREDIBLE PRESENT.][Mother]-“Who has got this one? Ah this is called “Dhanush” (Bow), in Sanskrit its called “Indra Dhanush”. This is the arrow of Indra”.[YOGI ALSO TELLS MOTHER THAT IT WAS HANDMADE BY A YOGI FROM KAZAKHSTAN.][SY] – “Mother, What did you say?”[SOME ONE PLAYS A MUSICAL INSTRUMENT AND MOTHER PRAISES HIM/HER.][SOME CONVERSATION.]

[Mother] – “Just call the girls who yesterday were very emotional. The girls, one girls’ heart” .... [INAUDIBLE]..“The girl who caught her heart yesterday , you and him. Who has given you the realization?[INAUDIBLE CONVERSATION]Who looks after you? Put your hands towards me.What do you do, it’s a serious thing. Let me see. Are you getting cool breeze? No, lets see this on side, left, right catching too, agyna, have you seen? Its catching very badly. Be careful. You dominate them too much, you discipline them too much. Is it? See these two children were very much on the left. Be careful, you see I was quite frightened because the girl could have got the heart attack yesterday. The another one could not bear it.”

You see what these vibrations are like. Just see. Put your left towards me, I think left is shaking. See now. Better bring lemon and chillies for him. In the evening. Better sit there with the light. Be careful, serious things you know. It can be very dangerous for Sahaj Yoga.

Let the girls also put their left towards me and right to that side. See, heart left heart, agyna very bad. See all of you feeling it? Put your left hand, right hand there. Come here, come this side. All of those who are with you. All of those who are with him. You are better of ....[.INAUDIBLE]...

What do you in your meditation? Ah, how do you do your meditation? All these girls are shaking, isn’t it. Their right side is shaking. That means the push of the left, on right is very big. Yesterday only, I noticed it first time. That’s why you see, you must have discipline otherwise it can be dangerous.[INAUDIBLE CONVERSATION]She is shaking too. That’s the reason, she could not bear yesterday. May be she has a defect, all of them have.

Let me see Martin. Where is Martin. ...Ego, too much.... Must try to be alright first of all, you see when you try to do something for others, you must know, you should be alright, otherwise you might put bhoots into other people. And I was so shocked because this girl could have fainted yesterday. All of your family must come to Sahaj Yoga.[Sahaj Yogi] –“5th May 1982... he came Mother.”[Mother] – “I am surprised. What’s the matter with him? He came to India? Better get alright first. Left void.”[INAUDIBLE CONVERSATION]

[Mother] – “Haven’t have My dinner. All those who are doing Sahaj Yoga with anyone, I didn’t know about him. Never told Me. Why?... You must know using your vibrations.[.....INAUDIBLE... ]... bring into Sahaj Yoga, and see this. You must write to her. Is he better now? Put your right hand towards her now. Mostly, the left is very bad, put your left hand towards me, open your palm. Shaking? Alright you put it to the light. She is better now. She is better. Just watch me, don’t watch him.

Martin, what’s the matter with you? See, she is very dominating, is she? Agyna, terrible agyna you have. You believe in Christ? Yes, then how humble you are? He was the greatest Sahaj Yogi, how humble He (Lord Jesus) was.Terrible, don’t get the pain there. I think she ....[ INAUDIBLE].... Is she married?Alright, I don’t want to spoil your mood today but lead the charge of the place without my permission and people should inform me. Yesterday this child have, such a thing would have happened. She is so weak....better now.How long you have been in Sahaj Yoga?[Sahaj Yogi] – “One year tomorrow.”

[Mother] – Alright pull your ears, all of you, pull your ears, pull your ears. That’s good. Now see, they are better, your vibrations? You send somebody ...[INAUDIBLE]... not alright. You need some meditation.

You have to put the left hand towards the photograph and right hand on the Mother Earth. And on the left hand, you should have the light. Alright, clear out, this shaking must go. You will get it even from the photograph. You must clear out, you see. First of first, you should be alright, isn’t it? You should have your own powers fully established, isn’t it? So that [... INAUDIBLE...] isn’t it? Otherwise you will cause more harm, it goes against the work. See yesterday, this girl would have been lost, I was worried.

She told me she does ...[. INAUDIBLE]....But I know something must be different. So a Sahaj Yogi could be sort of a medium unless and until you perfect yourself.You see, Sahaj Yoga makes you go along [PLEASE CHECK THIS], even one hole in a ship can drown the ship. We all have to be very alert.

[Sahaj Yogi] – Mother, I come from Spain.[Mother ]- So may God bless you all, look after these two. How far you live?[Sahaj Yogi] – Mother, about 800 km away.[Mother] – What about that girl? We shall send her to America.[Sahaj yogi] – Natalie?

[Mother] – No, she is alright. She is alright, alright. She is better, I mean her right heart, left heart. Natalie, You should look after now; Others for time being, he is alright. Now ...[INAUDIBLE].. don’t be disappointed, you will be alright. But you must know, first of all if you are not alright, you can harm others. Now this is a sign, now you can see yourself. Try to help.[Sahaj Yogi] – I am not doing anything.

[Mother] – No, you are! You don’t meditate. Why see, otherwise I am not doing anything, why is this shaking? Try to face it. You know, this child could have been dead yesterday. Try to understand otherwise I would not be panicked like that, you see. Try to understand, alright.This is God’s work. We have to be careful. It may react from you all. Be careful. It becomes serious; we had one of the persons in India.[INAUDIBLE CONVERSATION]

[Mother] – The one who dies recently, can’t remember his name. He went out of Sahaj Yoga. I mean we couldn’t bear him as he would not correct himself, he died. Suddenly he died, very young.What’s the meaning of such life?[Sahaj Yogi] – Mother I sit down.[Mother] – You better sit down on the other side. .... Usha, come here.[Sahaj Yogi] – Mother I am not doing anything. .... [INAUDIBLE.]

[Mother] – No you don’t teach anything now, alright? Just keep out for a while, for the time being. But you do now, you understand, left hand towards the photograph, right hand towards the Mother Earth, clear every day. First of all you must clear yourself. I am worried about you first because you have been such a ... [INAUDIBLE]..Alright? It happens, doesn’t matter.I mean if he can bring in from somewhere, if he can correct himself, better we must save him.[MOTHER CONVERSE WITH AN INDIAN YOGINI WHO TOLD MOTHER ABOUT HER ILL HEALTH. MOTHER SUGGESTED HER TO GO TO INDIA.]

[A YOGINI PRESENTS A COVER FOR SOME INSTRUMENT TO MOTHER AND MOTHER REALLY APPRECIATES.]I hope they keep to this, otherwise they loose all their art. Beautiful.Give him a bandhan so he will not have a pain.What is this with men, women names, everyone has same name?[SAHAJ YOGI EXPLAINS TO MOTHER THAT EVERY NAME HAS A FEMININE AND MASCULINE FORM BY MENTIONING SOME EXAMPLES. MOTHER ENJOYS THE DIFFERENCE AND COMPARES WITH THE URDU LANGUAGE.]

Oh! how my children are there, all of them, to organize.I was very much touched, I was very much happy to see you there, really. I mean the way you are holding the phone I was wondering whose going to translate, and there she is. She knows the one who knows both the languages, the best. Very much touched.Hello Ganesh how are you? No no no no, you got...[Sahaj Yogi] – Its just to vibrate Mother.

[Mother] – I thought again she has brought something for me. She has given me for five years now. Put him right to the left.[Sahaj Yogini] – This is from Cecil.[Mother] – Cecil is also little bit.... Haan![CONVERSATION AMONGST THE YOGIS.]

Let me see Cecil’s husband. What’s the matter with you? Are you alright. Ah! No no not that. Beacause Your wife is catching very badly, on the husband’s side. So that’s why, that’s all. That’s all.That’s all. That’s all.What other ones you have?[Sahaj Yogi] – ..INAUDIBLE..[Mother] – Why, why, what problems?

Come, left hand, left hand towards the light.[Sahaj Yogi] – Mother she did astrology and other things..[Mother] – Who? He?[Sahaj Yogi] – No Mother, Cecil.[Mother] – And he too did?

[Sahaj Yogi] – No no. She has got left Swadishthan problem. May she has always had left Swadishthan problem also. May she has not fully worked, and also she tends to feel because she has more discipline than the others. She has this, she gets up in the morning 4:30 no problems.[Mother] – She’s right heart that’s why.[Sahaj Yogi ] – Maybe she has this discipline she does not see that there are some other problems to be worked out. She told me last time, and I was very surprised about it. She told me collective life is not what she expected, but I have to suffer to get something like that...

[Mother] – What happened? No, no, no, don’t come for sufferings.[Sahaj Yogi ] – With ego also.[Mother] – How long have you been in Sahaj Yoga?[Sahaj Yogi ]- One year.[Mother] – Then you must come up. You cannot afford to go on like that. What is not this, what is, don’t worry about ohoooooooo. Must say, now left side. Left Vishuddhi, don’t, first of all, don’t have guilty, first of all.[MOTHER CONVERSES WITH AND INDIAN YOGI IN HINDI.]

[Sahaj Yogini] – This is the present for the ashram at [LOAAN?] street.[Mother] – He is here! Is he?[Sahaj Yogi] – He is in that ashram.[Mother] – It is a very good ashram. What’s the matter? There must be some bhootish there. Life is so enjoyable. Just think of it, is a very good ashram compared to some of the ashrams in London. I was so happy, so you don’t see, when you are a happy person you don’t see all these things.I saw your letter written to Gregiore. What I have to say, in money matters, anything you want to do you must consult others before hand. You should have written to Gregiore, taken his permission and then done it. Or it should be consulted, it should not be done off hand. Then everybody will start doing that way. You see, then there will be a big problem. You know Me, if I can take away all your money, makes no difference to me.It’s so simple. Alright, you don’t know how meticulous that I am sitting there. I am very meticulous. Very meticulous.

[Sahaj Yogi] – That’s nice Mother.Very interesting things happened with Richard just. Richard from Holland![Mother] – What happened?[Sahaj Yogi] – His sister is really trying to turn his mother and father against Sahaj Yoga and against him. His sister![Mother] – How? I think it is a very serious thing to talk against Sahaj Yoga. It is becoming like that. And be careful. When did she die? Did you hear that?

[Mother] – What is her age? What was her age? I tell you another thing about money. Important. There is a gentleman in Bombay. There’s a gentleman in Bombay, who tried to embezzle little bit of money, tried to in the sense, misplace the money here and there, without asking Me or others.And his son-in-law is a realized soul, and a very good person. And they had such a funny accident that all of them; the car completely went upside down. But because of the son-in-law everybody was alright. But the father-in-law, after the accident he was the only one who got diabetes of a serious nature.Nobody knew he had done something about money. I knew of course. Then he telephoned to Me and I told him what have you done about the money.

(MOTHER LAUGHS)And he was shocked. I said you pull your ears now. Don’t repeat it again. And he’s alright. Alright. Better... See better. How is he?

[Mother] – Mariam in there? Where is she? I think the, who came to see me, your mother was that? Very nice, she is looking so much better.She is looking so much better, I couldn’t recognize her. When she first met me, she was very haggard, very pulled down, she couldn’t talk properly.Where is Mariam? Parents are coming as well. I was just saying, is he fast asleep? Very disturbed child. Lets see his vibrations. He was born in America, isn’t it?[Sahaj Yogini] – ....INAUDIBLE ..

[Mother] – Your parents, family. I think you better, you would like to tell about your brothers to these people. What happened to them, your brother. Would you like to tell them?[Sahaj Yogini] – Now?[Mother:] Yes, alright take the things. French, in French. Loudly. Right to the left. Right to the left. Better now. Much better. To your right.[SAHAJ YOGINI NARRATES IN FRENCH.]

[Mother] – So we are protected people, you must know that. So how is your mother in .....(church I think), she is better now? She has some sense? Good.[Sahaj yogi] – ..INAUDIBLE...[Mother] – Where is Cecil? Also with her left nabhi, something wrong with her, could be paternal. Hers is a hurt ego, ego is a hurt one, hurt ego.Cecil, thank you for the present, but you have to know that you have to be alright. Now see you forehead. Can you see in the mirror? Just show her the mirror. Just see. Put your hands, just see your forehead. Can you see the tow bumps. Two big ones. What are they?Beginning of Ekadasha! You dominate your husband too much, do you? Don’t be like French women. You have to be a Sahaj Yogini. Alright. Its very badly catching. May God bless you.

If you are not kind to your husband I will not take your presents. Put your hands down under my foot. Put your both the hands towards me. Now, Vishal see her vibrations. Martin see her vibrations. Put your hands towards me.See your hands are so red. Just put your hands, both of them. Put like this. See now, yourself. See now. Ego, ego is glimmering here. Ego, ego, ego. Put your right hand towards photograph, left hand up and both the feet in the bottom. Forehead on the ground.

[Mother] – What sort of a man you are? You must control her. Should I give you that? Where is that? What is this, you see Frenchmen are, become like some dainty darlings. They are more, they are more feminine than the women are. That’s what they are bending themselves, for ladies, for this that. Having a, having a small little waist like that. Don’t try to please your women. Of course not. You have to please your Mother, you have to please your Mother, not your women.

We Indian women are very clever. You must learn from us how we control our husbands. No. I don’t mind. We make, we make ourselves indispensable. We make beautiful food. We know all their tricks, what they like what they don’t like, and also we know what they don’t know. They can’t exist without us.

One man told Me, a foreigner, westerners said that: “English, Indian men are cowards, cowards, they can’t divorce their wives. (MOTHER LAUGHS)Because they cannot cook, so they cannot divorce their wives. That’s not the point. Those who divorce are cowards, they are escapists. They try to escape you see. They want to run away. (CHECK IF THIS SENTENCE IS CORRECT.) But somehow here the women , the shoe is on the other leg. Somehow, other foot.

I don’t know how they manage. But so. You have to topple them down little more. The women have to please the men, not the men have to please the women. In pleasing the men you control them. This is the trick. No.

[Sahaj Yogi] – Shall we resist?[Mother] – No there is no resistance. It’s a mutual understanding. It’s a mutual love, you know. And that oneness only develops when you understand that you can’t do without each other. It’s a very simple to understand.For example, I don’t understand anything about human love, so I give in. My husband is an expert. I say, “You look after them”. I know Divine laws and I look after that. And I help by Divine laws. But if it comes to human laws, then he helps me. But for him I would have been in jail long time back.

Mother – Oh! Of course! Because I do all kind of things, you know. Like giving realization, all illegal things.[MOTHER LAUGHS]
