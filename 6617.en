Advice on marriage on the occasion of Tony (Cooly) Paniotou's  wedding at Hesta Spiro's mother's house, Abbey Lodge, London (England), 4 July 1980.

For today, specially I am very happy with Cooly (Tony Paniotou), Cooly  is such an ardent Sahaja Yogi, and Dawn has done so much spreading of Sahaja Yoga, brought so many people from Brighton. Both of them are great Sahaja Yogis. You all have to be really thankful for all these great occasions. Because of her people have Sahaja Yoga and because of him many have stayed in Sahaja Yoga and consolidated it. So it's a very great day for us to feel very proud.

Moreover, I think this marriages seldom have been performed before, where so many realised souls have attended a wedding! So the grace of God has descended on this earth in such a beautiful way. It has many dimensions of beauty and joy [that is] very hard to express beyond this feeling, understanding. It's really great.

My only advice is that, we must learn to enjoy, this capacity we have lost. That's the only thing we have lost is the method of enjoyment, everything [else] is there. Just you have to try to find out ways and methods of enjoyment so you will not get into arguments, will not try to criticise, will not try to find faults with each other. Just try to enjoy each other.

Enjoyment comes out of whatever is good. Say, if a fruit has got some part which is sour and some part which is rotten, you take out that part of the fruit which is alright and enjoy it. In the same way when you are dealing with your partners and friends, then other Sahaja Yogis you must put your attention to the good points of other Sahaja Yogis and then you will imbibe those good points within you. But your attention should be on good points because that is what is enjoyable in the other person. By seeing the bad points you become a miserable creature and make the other fellow also miserable. By that you do not help yourself neither you help the other person. So the best thing to do is to enjoy the best part in others, and you'll be amazed [that], by that enjoyment, the other feels very secured, happy, joyous and that goodness starts spreading to other parts of the body, to other parts of the being, other parts of the mind and the whole can be made very beautiful.

And enjoyment can give you the real insight into the understanding of others. If you cannot enjoy another person that means something wrong with you, not with that person. After realisation, specially, it should be very easy. Before realisation of course I don't say - that could be very difficult. But after realisation one should try to see the good points. Like, in a room there is light, in another room there is no light so we take the light from one room to another, to another, and another. We cannot bring light from the dark room. In the same way we have to go, move, from the part that is enjoyable to other parts and this has very subtle effect, extremely subtle. When you start enjoying another person he develops self-esteem and he tries to be enjoyable also.

But the relationship between husband and wife is very, very intimate, and the enjoyment should be maximum between them when they are Sahaja Yogis. But they should give up the old patterns of married lives as there are, like: husband can do whatever he likes and he's free. And the wife is free to do whatever she likes, she's on her own and he's on his own and nobody should object and that sort of a nonsensical life. Because you're not on your own. You are part of the Whole. You're all joined together. You all have to work in such a way that you feel that unity within yourself. This is what one does not realise that we cannot be on our own.

Your freedom is in enjoying the freedom of others, not abandonment. After realisation the freedom lies in understanding the freedom of others not your own freedom, the so-called. That is how you'll get over your aggressiveness. And for small, small things, for petty things, for useless things a Sahaja Yogi is not going to argue because he's found out something so high, so absolute.

I'll give you an example, how a Sahaja Yogi can behave and a non-sahaja yogi. For example, a non-sahaja yogi comes to a room which is decorated say by a wife and now, he comes says, "Oh I don't like this colour, I, I don't like that colour." You see, "Why did you put that? And this could have been cheaper," some sort of thing like that. ‘I’. Or the wife can do the same. But when a Sahaja Yogi marries a non-sahaja yogi he says, "Do you like it? Then I like it. Did you like it? Really you liked it, then I like it. If you have liked it, I would like. Whatever you believe, I will believe into it." This “I believe”, “I believe, I like" - these words go away.

Third is, “I think”. We do not think. Sahaja Yogis do not think, we are beyond thinking (laughing), so you should say, “I enjoy being with you.” “I enjoy being your wife, or your husband.” Our terminology has to change because now we have become the suckers of joy, not of misery. The whole priorities must be changed in life. How to please others should be the priority. How to make the other person feel the trust. How much can you give, not take. Who out beats the other in giving, who is more generous between the two.

For example, say, one Sahaja Yogi has a friend and another is her husband or wife, whatever it is, then [if] the friend is coming, then the husband or wife who is not the friend must go all out to help the wife or the husband to make the friendship stronger, purer, beautiful, just to please your companion but not to pamper the ego. This is a very subtle thing one should understand for which one should ask for wisdom, that you are not pampering the ego of the person, because you know what is ego. But if you think by saying something it hurts another person better not say.

Sahaja Yoga takes its own course and works out all those corrections; you don't have to worry about correcting others but just enjoying others. That you leave it to Me, that's My job. If you just enjoy each other and love each other, you have really returned all My love. That's all I want that, as I have loved you have to love each other, with all your heart with all your soul. Without expecting any return except that, the feeling that you have loved.

May God bless this marriage and all other marriages that are going to come forward.

As a Mother it is so fulfilling. Now I can retire gradually, I think I can. The great souls are going to be born, so we must await their coming. That's why it is necessary that establish good relationship and harmony because we all have to work together not separately on our own. Try to be harmonious as far as possible. We are thankful to Hesta (Spiro) for inviting us to this place, she was very kind. Really she's been always very, very kind, extremely kind. Very sweet of you to have invited us here, all of us, and we are going to have a very nice time now, very nice time. You wanted me to be here in the night and we're all going to enjoy ourselves the whole night and it's going to be wonderful.

So what are you going to sing to the bride and the bridegroom? I would like them to sit on some chair at least. Ah, this is good for Cooly (Tony Paniotou) and both of them can sit together, come along. He's feeling more shy than the bride now give him a veil! Is better that he has a veil on him (laughing).

Hesta is looking so sweet in that saree , very sweet (laughing).

I'm missing Malcom (Murdoch) very much, he wrote such a sweet letter today, he’s very sweet. I'm happy Alan is here, you have to arrange also Alan's marriage one day, alright?

Here sit down, yes, sit down, sit down there. Sit down, sit down. First the bride has to sit you see, after marriage bride is important. Sit down. So how did the ceremony went off? Good? So what is the program?

Yogini: "We had tea Mother"

Shri Mataji: "Tea, alright."

Yogini: "Not very original suggestion."

Shri Mataji:Whatever I think let's finish the dinner alright? Would be a good idea. All Harley Street is now looking out for patients because Arabs are going away! Who's going to pay them? They are spoilt really, poor things.

What beautiful flowers uh? Beautiful.

About the petrol?

Yogini: Well we went shopping today in Houndsditch (a market road in the City of London near Petticoat Lane where there are many Indian/Bangladeshi shops) today to buy some sweets and things and when Hari was driving and when we went to start the car to come back it wouldn’t start, we couldn’t do a thing. So first we thought it was the petrol so we went looking for petrol. So we walked and walked then we got to the petrol station and they didn’t do diesel so we stood around for ages waiting for a taxi and nothing came, then Hari said we better pray to Mother. And just that minute, somebody called him over and asked him to start their car, to push it. And they ended up taking us to some place where we got diesel, taking us all the way back, and the car still wouldn’t start (laughter)

Shri Mataji: No, but tell the,  then the petrol was brought but still the car would not start. Then they had to go and get the oil, so they went and bought the oil. Then it would not open the bonnet you see so poor Hari was to learn everything about, so he learnt everything about the car and I was sitting quietly, sitting and watching everybody passing and coming down. Still it would not start. So then they said, "It's automatic it cannot start." So I said, "Then it's alright." I was sitting at that point, at that place throughout, you see, and then we had to take a train and both of us came by train, still I was enjoying Myself thoroughly. So then what I said you should say, because Christine said, "Mother aren't you tired, sitting in one place and sitting just there doing nothing, aren't you tired." And it was such a negative, I mean there was negative forces and I had to sit there. But what I told her was the thing, you just listen. So what did I say?

Yogini: "That you had to be there."

Shri Mataji: I had to be there, that's all. What is there to be tired, I mean that's My job? I enjoyed every minute of it, and I had to come by train, that was also so, everything has to be, so you have to do it.

Linda Williams: And then Peter (Pierce) went there and just started the car just like that!

Shri Mataji: Whole thing was like a drama. But you can make it very laborious, horrible, boring stuff you see. Whole thing was such a beautiful drama and I saw all kinds of people coming, walking. Most of them I think had either a limb missing, or a hand missing or a finger missing. All sorts of faces coming up that road and all kinds of women, all types I think all funny also and very, very, very adharmic women were passing that way and I had to do something about them. I think that is the spot I had to go. Which Marcus has said that, "Mother I know why you had to go to Houndsditch now, it's a hound's ditch!” You see.

Yogini presents Mother with something.

"Oh, thank you very much. Oh My God, how many things!"

Yogini: Everybody has brought something.

Shri Mataji: Except for Me, I brought Myself (laughter). Thank you.

Yogini: You brought everything Mother!

Shri Mataji: Can you push this in a little so that I can put it alright? Such a nice idea, you know, to have a foot, rest. Very good, thank you. What about these Maharastrian ladies were coming, they said they were going to come

Yoginis: They were going to come we don’t know where they are.

Shri Mataji: She has been asking Me to.... Now Chaya (Camille) is going to tell another story. Chaya, come along get up and say. First of all tell how I got it so cheap for them.

(Chaya Camille tells a story about a buying a saree at a very cheap price and getting a border stitched and needing red thread and having to go to an unwell yogis place to get the red thread).

Shri Mataji: See because of the red thread. Now there are three or four sarees selected out of which Cooly selected the red one and the red thread was with Patricia (Proenza), who was sick. If these people had not gone there she would not have been here and I would have missed her. Because they had to go and get the red thread from her and that's why she got cured and she's here. All these stories must be written down, isn't it?  Just imagine what a small thing it is. But the saree's a miracle, absolutely because we had a big fight. I said, "I'll not take any sarees nothing, you’re not going to waste your money, all that." Then ultimately I think Peter was on my back all the time. "Mother please, please you must accept, you must accept." I said, "Alright." Then Maureen (Rossi) followed Me up to My house, she said, "Fifteen pounds is not, we have put twenty one between both of us, not much. Twenty one is good, twenty one You must accept, twenty one." Big fight was on. I told her, "In twenty one you'll get a nylon saree, I don't wear nylon. So what's the use of giving Me a nylon? You can't get cotton here, nothing, so forget it." And there it is £22, I gave in, really this is the miracle of your love, absolutely. This is not My miracle, you’re going to out beat Me I can tell you, in miracles! Because I was arguing and I thought this argument is going to hit the point but that also you have managed.

Now, and for Guru Puja also same thing, I told him that, "I will not take a saree," and I said, "Don't give Me any shawl, because shawls I have many." But he found a shawl which I do not have for Guru Puja. Just because of his love, after all I don't need really anything. But just out of love things work out, just to suggest, you see, all these small things. How do you suggest. Red thread. That's why material things are just expressions of the movement of love, how the love works it out, how it puts it. Everything has that love pulsating.

It happened also once in Bombay: I had a big quarrel on this saree business. I said, "I'll take only khaadi sarees, you see, khaadi sarees. Don't give Me anything expensive, I won't take anything." So I said, "The price should not be more that five pounds, that's the limit. Five pounds now is about hundred rupees, and a cotton khaadi saree is alright." But they had discovered that all cotton sarees are lying in Bombay, they don't go with Me to London.

So Modi came to Me and he gave me a saree, silk saree. I said, "I've told you not to give me a silk saree, why did you give Me a silk saree?" He said, "Now Mother you really tell me, You won't believe the price of this is less than hundred rupees." I said, "How can that be, is an impossible." He said, "Just I was wondering now what to do, I have to again get this cotton saree, is Mother's instruction." A man knocked at my door and he said, "There are some saree's for sale would you like to see." He brought in these saree's and he said, "I have a very nice silk saree for you, if you want you can take it and I'll give it you very cheaply" And it was less than hundred, which you cannot get. And he said then, "I was so amazed that it fits into Mothers price and how is it, you see,  won't believe, you ask my wife, you ask my children they were all there. But the fellow disappeared after that.” I don't know if it's a made up story (laughter).

But it has happened with Me a many a times, small, small things like that. I went to Delhi once and I saw a very beautiful Ganesha made of stone, we call it serpentine, I don't know your serpentine is different from ours. It's a very expensive stone and I enquired in the shop I said, "How much for a Ganesha?" I thought I'll give to someone, some Sahaja Yogis I can give one. And he said it was five hundred rupees. I said, "If I give it to one then what will the others say, then I'll have to buy all of these and there aren't enough." When I came to Bombay, Gavin and all that is not here, you were there, I was amazed Modi gave you presents of serpentine stone, this Ganesha. I just started looking at it. I said, "How did he get that?" He said he had gone to Rajasthan last year, he got them very cheap from there and he had kept them for the Sahaja Yogis from the England, coming from England. You know I was so much enamoured by the beauty of Sahaja that I just desired that I would like, and to each and every person he gave, he gave you also, you were there. He gave you, you've got that one with you, you should show them. And I just watched him, you know. If I wanted this is five hundred rupees worth, and to one person if I give I have to give to all of them what will happen. And here he is, all of them got. So the working of love is so clearly seen, how it works out.

That's why little bit giving to others and taking from others is important in Sahaja Yoga. There's nothing wrong if you give to someone and you take from. For example, you know that I also give lots of things. Because it's not the money that is important, it's not how much you have spent but how you expressed your love through little things like giving flowers or anything that you give with love. It has such a meaning, it is such a great thing. Otherwise what is all this matter, is useless. But it has a meaning when it has that feeling behind it, then it becomes great. It's like a mirror which is ah, that you you put the mercury behind [the glass], then it becomes a mirror, it starts reflecting. In the same way anything which has that feeling it acts like a mirror and then it starts reflecting, the love and the beauty of that person, you see.

There are two nice stories about giving, and one [is] about Rama and one about Krishna but I don't know if I've told you about Rama stories and the Shabari an old aboriginal woman who was there and she gave the kind of a fruit (called ber - Ziziphus mauritiana) [that is]  like berries, after testing them with her teeth, to Rama. Every fruit she took out, tested it nicely, I mean ate them in the sense that she pierced them with her teeth, to see they were sour or not and then they kept them collected in a bunch, I mean in a basket. And when He came, you see, she took them to Rama and she said to him, you see, I mean first she talked to all the leaves and all the trees and everyone that, "Give me the best fruits alright, He's coming now and I've adored Him, I have prayed for Him, now He's coming so you give me the best fruit." And then she collected all those things and she was waiting for Him to come and when He came she washed His feet and made Him sit down and then she offered this fruit. She said, "Every piece I have tested, so you can eat all of them because they're not at all sour.”  Oh Rama took that immediately, started eating it, "What a nice thing! Really I've never eaten such fruits, never in My life I have had such good fruits. What taste! Immensely delicious!" and Lakshman the brother was getting very angry with her that, “what is this?” In India what is regarded [as] uttishtha (forbidden). You see, if somebody has eaten something except for [when] that person is a saint, you’re not suppose to eat that, and this lady had done all that, eating and he was enjoying it.

So He told His wife, Sita, he said, "Oh, I cannot give you anything out of this, if you want to have more you should ask her to get some more. But I will never share anything!" So Sita says, "No, no, no, no. Little bit let me also enjoy. What is this? You’re going to enjoy everything. It's no good after all I am your ardhani, I'm your half personality so you cannot eat the whole, You have to give Me little bit." Then she took some, and she started eating, then She tells Her brother-in-law, She says,  you see , “I’ve never eaten really such nice fruits, so I'm not going to give You anything even if You ask for it, I'm not going to give You can ask Your brother." His brother said, "No I've shared with You but why should I share with Him, You can share with Him why should I share, this is so great,”  you see, and She was praising and praising, then Lakshman said, "Alright, let me also have a little." so She says, "Alright I will give you only few." Rama said, "Alright first you give, then I will see how much I can give." So She counted and gave Him, He ate. He said, “Really, there’s something, something I don't know, it's like amrutfal,” Amrutfal is the fruit of nectar, you see, “I just cannot imagine what a taste it is.” He asked Rama, "After all You cannot be that selfish You are My elder brother You have to share Your things with Me. Better give me some,” and they started, you see, quarreling about it. Such a beautiful description in the Ramayana, of Shabari ke ber, the bers of Shabari.  This is one of the things (stories).

The second is when Krishna became the king He had a friend who was a, when He was a student, When Krishna was studying, this friend Sudama was studying with Him. You see, they both were great friends. Then Krishna became a great king and Sudama became a poor brahmin living in Dwarika. And so he said, "I must go and see the king, and though He's my friend He won't recognise me. So, doesn't matter, but I must go and meet him after so many years I'm going to meet Him, so I must go and meet Him. Somehow I'll find ways of meeting the king." So he said now he asked his wife, "Is there anything in the house that I can take for him to eat." She said, "We are so poor what do we have to give to a king, we don't have anything." He said, "Alright, if you don't have anything at least he'll be having” that we eat as called as something, “chiwda”. That is made from the rice, pounded rice, and you see, he must have eaten that sort of a thing, it’s very cheap stuff.

So he said, "Alright give me a little bit of that and I'll take this to him." She said, "Aren’t you ashamed of yourself? You are going to see a king and here you are, you haven't got proper clothes and you are taking this chiwda for him which even you wouldn't take to a poor friend and to a king are you supposed to take this chiwda?" He said, "Whatever it is now then I must take something. I can't go like this after all I’m meeting My friend. For so many years I have not met him, after all I'm going as a friend and as children we used to enjoy everything. So I will take it."

So he tied it up in a small little bundle and put it in his covering cloth that we use. And he was a very poor man with all his bones and very thin body wearing a dhoti and little covering cloth, and he just hid it under that covering cloth and went to see Him.

And Krishna knew that he was going to come. He had told his wives, He had five wives that time, these were the five elements, you see. So He said, "My great friend is coming, you all have to make all the preparations for his bath, for his food and he's to be treated like the greatest VIP and there should be not mistake at all! And you plan it out properly, if there’s any mistake and you have to wash his feet and wipe his feet with your hair, so clean you hair first of all." - To the Queens! Can you imagine? All these orders were on. And He had told all the people that, "There's a friend of mine who's going to come." So, all the people were informed, guards were informed that a friend of Shri Krishna is coming, everybody should be on his best behaviour(?). And they thought he'll come on a elephant, you see, with a big trumpet blowing in front, His friend [was] coming, after all, Sudama.

So here Sudama walks, you see, with his little thing hiding here. A thin, lean, short gentleman and knocks at the door. So the guard asked, "Who are you? Why are you coming here just now keep away, because Shri Krishna friend is coming and we are all waiting for Him and where are you going you look like a beggar?" He said, "Alright which friend is coming?" He said, "There’s somebody coming so you don't worry now." He said, "Alright but please go and tell Shri Krishna that your friend Sudama has come, will you have some time to see me tomorrow?" He said, "Are you Sudama?" He Said, "Oh God, we are sorry!” You see, they all prostrated themselves before him. They opened the door, “Oh God you are Sudama why didn't you say, we are sorry sir, we are very sorry." And they all prostrated [before him]. They said, "We never knew you are Sudama." And then the news went that, "Sudama has come." Shri Krishna has gone for his retirement and there were, His wives were pressing His feet. He heard it is true. He ran, "Oh my friend has come." He ran all the way, He ran from the staircases, He ran, running with His whole this...He was wearing, that dhoti, as we call it. You see, it was all falling out and He was running and holding it and running that His friend has come and He went and embraced him, and the tears started flowing from His face. And He said, "Oh my friend, how many years you have not even remembered me? Now you come down. and He took him inside and He made him sit in his own place and sat next to him. And this fellow was feeling very shy with his torn clothes and all that, you know. So he said that, “Right now you have to tell me one thing first of all, my sister in law,” is Sudama's wife, “must have give you something for Me?” He said, "No, no, you see, what can we bring for you are a king." He said, "No, no, that's not possible! Must be,  there must be something.

(somebody gives some wedding cake to Shri Mataji)

Great! It’s nice. Beautiful. Very well done. Very soft.

So Krishna got after him, he said, "No, no, you have tell me what has she sent for Me?" "No she has not given anything." He said, " Now what are you hiding under that cloth of yours?" He said, "You know nothing, nothing." So he pulled it out. He said, "Oh this is what she sent for Me," and he opened it, He said, “This I'm not going to give to anyone,” and He started eating like a glutton, you see, whole thing started with both the hands. So Sudama said, “Still you are just the same the same, the same child.” I said, "What do you mean, you want it? I'm not going to give you." So he looked at Him. Then He told his wife, “You don't look at him, don't feel jealous, I'm not going to give her anything out of it even a drop.”  So the Queen says, “Don't you think we deserve a little at least?” “Alright if something falls down you can have it, but not from my hand I will not give. It is such a precious thing, is soooo tasty, it is so beautifully done. You cannot get it in the whole world like this."

So the Queen knew what it was. She said. “Little bit if you give us as a prasad it will be good,” So Sudama said, "Don't be so selfish, after all it's not that good you are just bluffing, why don't you give?” He said, “I am not bluffing.” And then he gave it to them and they said, “Really? We have never had such a thing! What is this precious? What is this beautiful thing?” And they really all enjoyed. And then he said, "Now you have had a bath you had a nice sleep now I want to show everyone my friend, so we are going to take you out in a procession.

So he made good clothes for him and He said, "Now we are all going to go out, celebrate." He said' "No Babaa, my cloths are alright." He said, "No, but, for my sake, it won't look nice you see. I'll wear your clothes, you wear mine." So he took his clothes and he made him wear His own clothes. He said, "Oh, no, no, no, now you wear your clothes and I can wear these,” and they got into the procession.

Now there's a question in India that, when a procession is taken out, of a bride or a bridegroom, they put money or something just to take out the bad eyes, you see. That’s called vicharo (?). They just start throwing on people like that. Coins and things and all kinds. So Krishna was throwing jewels and pearls just to take out his bad eye you see (laughing), there should not be any bad eye on His friend! So He had asked them to put. Now the poor brahmin, Sudama, was thinking, “Not even one has fallen into my lap and He's taking out my bad eye!” (Mother is laughing) “Look at Him, why doesn't he understand that at least one should fall in my lap and the rest He's throwing it to others taking out my bad eye, and that people should not have bad eyes on me. So He’s distributing this to the poor, but I'm the poorest of poor I can't even get one out of that!!

And Krishna was smiling! Then after the whole procession was over and the meeting was over and then they had food and everything and next morning he said, "Now I must go back to my wife."

So when he went back he went in the same dress the he had come. And he couldn’t recognise, his house was missing, everything was missing, he said, “What has happened?” There was a very, very beautiful palace there. He just stood there and they, all people started saluting him. He  said, "You are our master. Please come in this is your own house, and his wife all decked up in jewellery and all that comes out. He started looking at it, "How is it that this is my house and you are my wife is it? And these are my children?” She said “This is all yours, Krishna Himself came here and did all this when you were sleeping there.”

So you can imagine the love of God. For that. And then he was eating he said, "I cannot compensate this taste, this joy that I'm getting, even if I could give you palaces after palaces” So this is what is giving and taking. See the beauty and the joy.

So you see the people living in this country, they said, "It's all right sir we don't mind but

as Cypriots, as called as from Cyprus, Cypriots, may be called as something else! (laughter) we are not prepared for that (laughing). For (?) the idiots you see. For he really is a real idiot I think!  There’s another one [Colonel] Gaddafi! Gadha means, in Hindi language means a donkey! (laughter) Really, it is. Gaddafi! (laughing)

Yogini: ...we were looking round and buying flowers and it was really nice.

Shri Mataji: There's another market which is of flowers, which is that called as?

Yogi: Covent Garden

Shri Mataji: Covent Garden, is the same thing, is a continuation, Covent Garden yes. Alright so?

(Yogini tells story about going to a market to buy flowers for the wedding and how they got a cheaper price for that and how sweet the flower sellers were.)

Shri Mataji: See now, they live with flowers you see, they live with flowers and they are so nice. But I knew something would happen even in the flower garden when you would go there, you see it works out. They are very simple people and it will work out there much faster than anywhere else. I have to go one day. What beautiful flowers actually, they are really, I mean.

Ray Harris: I’ll read the Hebrew first, read the chorus I’ll just read it through because it’s just such a beautiful poem.

Shri Mataji: Read loudly. Everybody should hear it

Ray Harris: (Reads out a poem in Hebrew from the Torah presumably)

Shri Mataji: Beautiful. It’s like mantras. All these scriptures are nothing but mantras. Clears your left nabhi. That is Gruha Lakshmi.

(break in recording)

Who are not Sahaja Yogis and ones who are Sahaja Yogis, can you find any third (type)? I mean the second category includes all bhoots, everything put together, from rakshasas to anything. So all of them on one side, Sahaja Yogis on the other side. So any, any thing, which is so great as a scripture is debased because they're not authorised! If this is understood, you see,  everybody’s opening out, can you imagine what silence?

So to claim that you're a Sahaja Yogi as just now read out, to be awakened, to arise, and not be ashamed to say that. So go out, all out and say that you are realised souls. Like Pat (Anslow) told me, that they said if you are a realised soul you should be able to build a pyramid, are they mad? Why should we have pyramids now we have to build human beings. We have had enough of these nonsensical things. You have to build human beings now. Once it is understood that we have to build the human beings, and when you start talking like that then they will know that you are realised souls. Your faces show that, anybody can see that you are flowers of the Creation. On a tree people know where are the flowers; that the leaves are leaves and flowers are flowers. You look  [like] flowers. Nobody has to doubt on that. You all looks flowers but you have to tell them what to do now, these blind people, that we are flowers now, see our fragrance, they are blind.

Very good, come here.

Yogini: She’s shy

Bhavasagara can be engulfed by these horrible crocodiles which are around so we feel sorry for that and we have to pull him back, because he’s so precious. I know his greatness very much that’s why he’s so precious. We never did this for Mr. Sharma who wrote a very, what you call? Treatise, you see. Nobody bothered about him. [Dr.] Rustom of course we are bothered. I know him too well.

You are actually giving him strength to come out of that crocodile. (must be giving bandhan) Ha! You see better?

You see, here there is no such judgment you know? Like somebody is very nice, somebody's bad - that's not the point! Today, where are the vibrations just now at this moment? All that is past. At this moment if the vibrations are alright, not alright you must help him. Next moment he'll be helping you. It's the present point,  at this point. Better now?

Shri Mataji: Left is. Huh? Put it in the centre.
