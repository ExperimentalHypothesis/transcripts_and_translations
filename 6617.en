Public Program. Abbey Lodge, London (England), 4 July 1980.


(Sounds like "Birthday") first day, I am very happy because you're here.  It means that your such an ardent Sahaja Yogi, and bound with that the (inaudible) to Sahaja Yoga who brought so many people from that.  Both of them are great Sahaja Yogis and you all have to be really thankful to them for (inaudible) on this great occasion.  Because of us so many people have come to Sahaja Yoga, (inaudible) many have stayed in Sahaja Yoga and consolidated.  It's a really great day for us to feel very proud and to talk to each other.  More over I think this marriage ceremony have been performed before where so many realized souls have attended a wedding, so the grace of God has descended on it, in such a beautiful way. 


It has many dimensions of purity and joy, very hard explain, beyond this feeling, understanding, it's really great.  My only advice is that, we must learn to enjoy, this capacity we have lost that's the only thing we have left is the method of enjoyment, everything is there.  Just try to find out ways and methods of enjoyment so you will not get into arguments, will not try to critize, will not try to find faults with each other, just try to enjoy each other.  Enjoyment comes out of whatever is good.  Say if a fruit has got some part which is sour and some part it is rotten, you take out that part of the fruit which is all right and enjoy it.  In the same way when you are dealing with your partners and friends and other Sahaja Yogis you must put your attention to the good points of other Sahaja Yogis and then you will imbibe those good points within you, but your attention should be on good points because that is what is enjoyable in the other person.  By seeing the bad points you become a miserable creature and make the other fellow also miserable.  By that you do not help yourself neither you help the other person.  So the best thing to do is to enjoy the best part with the others.


You'll be amazed by that enjoyment the other feels very secure, happy, joyous and with that goodness starts spreading to other parts of the body, to other parts of the being, to other parts of the mind and the whole can be made very beautiful.  An enjoyment can give you the real insight into the understanding of others.  If you cannot enjoy another person that means something wrong with you not with that person.  After realization especially it should be very easy.  Before realization of course I don't say that could be very difficult.  But after realization one should try to see the good points.  Like in a room there is light, in the other room there is no light so we take the light from one room to another, to other, and other.  We cannot bring light from the dark room.  In the same way we have to go, move from the part that is enjoyable to other parts and this has very subtle effect, extremely subtle.  When you start enjoying another person he develops self-esteem and he tries to be enjoyable also.


But the relationship between husband and wife is very, very intimate.  And the enjoyment should be maximum between them when they're Sahaja Yogis.  But they should give up the old patterns of married life as there are, like husband can do what ever he likes and he's free and the wife is free to do what ever she likes. She's on her own and he's on her own and nobody should object and that sort of a nonsensical life, because you're not on your own.  You are part of the whole, you're all joined together you all have to work in such a way that you feel that unity within yourself.  You see what one does not realize that we cannot be on our own, your freedom is in enjoying the freedom of others not abandonment.  After realization the freedom lies in understanding the freedom of others not your own freedom, so called.  That is how you'll get over your aggressiveness.  And for small, small things, for petty things, for useless things a Sahaja Yogi is not going to argue because he's found out something so high, so absolute.  


I'll give you an example how a Sahaja Yogi has behave and a non Sahaja Yogi.  For example a non Sahaja Yogi comes to a room which is decorated say by a wife.  Now, he comes says, "Oh I don't like this color, I, I don't like that color." You see?  "Why did you put that?  And this could have been cheaper," some sort of thing like that, I.  Or a wife can do the same.  But when a Sahaja Yogi marries a non Sahaja Yogi he says, "Do you like it?  Then I like it.  Did you like it?  Really you liked it, then I like it.  If you have liked it, I would like.  Whatever you believe, I will believe into it."  "This I believe, I believe, I like" - these words go away.


Third is I think, we do not think, Sahaja Yogis do not think we are beyond thinking.  So you should say I enjoy being with you.  I enjoy being you wife or your husband.  Our terminology has to change because now we have become the suckers of joy, not of misery.  Whole priorities must be changed in life.  How to please others should be the priority, how to make the other person feel the trust.  How much can you give, not take?  Who out beats the other in giving, who is more generous between the two?  For example say one Sahaja Yogi has a friend and another is her husband or wife whatever it is.  Then the friend is coming, then the husband or wife who is not the friend must go all out to help the wife or the husband to make the friendship stronger, purer, beautiful, just to please your companion, but not to pamper the ego.  This is a very subtle thing one should understand for which one should ask for wisdom, that you are not pampering the ego of the person, because you know what is ego.  But if you think by saying something it hurts another person better not say.  Sahaja Yoga takes its own course and works out all those corrections; you don't have to worry about correcting others but just enjoying others.  That you leave it to Me, that's My job.  If you just enjoy each other and love each other, see how really return all My love that's all I want, that as I have loved you have to love each other, with all your heart will all your soul.  Without expecting any return except that, the feeling that you have loved.  May God bless this marriage and all other marriages that are going to come forward.


As a Mother it is so fulfilling now I can retire gradually, I think I can.  The great souls are going to be born, so we must await their coming.  That's why it is necessary that establish good relationship and harmony because we have to all work together not separately on our own.  Try to be harmonious as far as possible.  We're thankful to Hesta for inviting us to this place, she was very kind.  Really she's been always very, very kind, extremely kind.  Very sweet of you to have invited us here, all of us and we are going to have a very nice time now, very nice time.  You wanted me to be here in the night and we're all going to enjoy ourselves the whole night and it's going to be wonderful.  So what are you going to sing to the bride and bridegroom?  I would like them to sit on some chair at least.  Ah, this is good for (sounds like - Tullie) and both of them can sit together, come along.  He's feeling more shy than the bride now give him a veil.  Is better that he has a veil on him.  Still he's looking so sweet in that (inaudible), very sweet.


(Delete-I'm missing Malcom very much, he wrote such a sweet letter.  Seems to be just some personal chat between Shri Mother and the yogis- I'm happy Alan is here, we have to arrange also Alan's marriage one day, all right.  Here sit down, yes, sit down, sit down there (inaudible).  Sit down, sit down.  First the bride has to sit you see, after marriage bride is important.  Sit down, so how did the ceremony went off?  Good?  So what is the program?  "We had tea Mother"  "Tea, all right."  "Not very original suggestion."  What ever it's very nice all right, let's finish the dinner all right, would be a good idea.  All Harley Street is now looking out our (sounds like - patients) because Arabs are going away, who's going to pay them, they are spoilt really,  poor thing.  What beautiful flowers, beautiful.  Chatter with the yogis, yogi is asked to tell a story about shopping and how the car ran out of petrol and how the had to try and get petrol.)


But then the petrol was brought but still the car would not start.  Then they had to go and get the oil, so they went and brought the oil.  Then it would not open the bonnet you see so poor Harry was to learn everything about, so he learnt everything about the car and I was sitting quietly, sitting watching everybody passing and coming down till it would not start.  So then they said, "It's automatic it cannot start."  So I said, "Then it's all right."  I was sitting at that point, at that place two hours you see, and then we had to take a train and both of us came by train, still I was enjoying Myself thoroughly.  So then what I said you should say, because Christine said, "Mother aren't you tired, sitting in one place and sitting just there and doing nothing, aren't you tired."  And it was such a negative, I mean there was negative forces and I had to sit there.  But what I told her was the thing, you just listen.  "So what did I say?"  "That you had to be there."  I had to be there, that's all.  What is there to be tired, I mean that's My job?  I enjoyed every minuet of it, and I had to come by train, that was also so, everything has to be, so you have to do it.  


(Delete-Yogins talks more about the drama )  


Whole thing was like a drama but you can make it very laborious, horrible, boring stuff you see.  Whole thing was such a beautiful drama and I saw all kinds of people coming, walking.  Most of them I think had either a limb missing, or a hand missing or a finger missing.  All sorts of faces coming up that road and all kinds of women, all types I think all funny also and very, very, very adharmic women were passing that way and I had to so something about them.  I think that is the spot I had to go.  Which Markas has said that, "Mother I know why you had to go to Houndsditch now, it's a hound's ditch, you see."


(Delete - Yogini presents Mother with something.  "Oh, thank you very much.  Oh My God, how many things!"  Yogini speaks again.  Except for Me, I brought Myself, Thank you."  Can you push this in a little so that I can put it all right, it's a nice idea you know to have our food, rest.  Very good thank you.  What about these Maharastran ladies were coming, they said.  She has been asking Me to (inaudible)  You all have some ham?  Now Chayya is going to tell another story, Chayya.  Come along get up and say.  First of all tell how I got it so cheap for them.  Yogi tells a story about a buying a sari at a very cheap price and getting a boarder stitched and needing red thread and having to go to an unwell yogis place to get the red thread).  


See because of the red thread.  Now there are three or four saris selected out of which Tullie selected the red one and the red thread was with Patricia, who was sick.  If these people had not gone there she would not have been here and I would have missed her.  So they had to go and get the red thread from her and that's how she got cured and she's here.  All these stories must be written down, isn't it.  Just imagine what a small thing it is.  Sari's a miracle, absolutely because we had a big fight.  


I said, "I'll not take any saris nothing, your not going to waste your money, all that."  


Then ultimately I think Peter was on my back all the time.  "Mother please, please you must accept, you must accept."  


I said, "All right."  Then Maurine followed Me up to My house, she said, "Fifteen pounds is not we have put twenty one between both of us, not much.  Twenty one is good, twenty one You must accept, twenty one."  Big fight was on.  


I told her, "In twenty one you'll get a nylon sari, I don't wear nylon.  So what's the use of giving Me nylon?  You can't get cotton here, nothing, so forget it."  And there it is twenty two, I gave in, really this is the miracle of your love, absolutely.  This is not My miracle, your going to out beat Me I can tell you, in miracles.  Because I was arguing and I thought this argument is going to hit the point but that also you have managed.  


And for Guru Puja also same thing, I told him that, "I'll not take a sari," and I said, "Don't give Me any shawl, because shawls I've many."  But he found a shawl which I do not have for Guru Puja, just because of his love, after all I don't need really anything.  But just out of love things work out, just to send shawl these small things.  How do you suggest, red thread.  That's why material things are just expressions of the movement of love, how the love works it out, how it persists.  Everything has that love pulsating.  


It happened also once in Bombay I had a big quarrel on this sari business.  I said, "I'll take only khardi sari see, khardi sari.  Don't give Me anything expensive.  I won't take anything."  So I said, "The price should not be more that five pounds, that's the limit.  Five pounds now about hundred rupees, and a cotton khardi sari is all right."  But they had discovered that all cotton sari's are lying in Bombay, they don't go with Me to London.  So Modhi came to Me and he said, he gave me a sari, silk sari.  I said, "I've told you not to give me a silk sari, why did you give Me a silk sari?"  He said, "Now Mother you really tell me, You won't believe the price of this is less than a hundred rupees."  I said, "How can that be, is an impossible."  He said, "Just I was wondering now what to do, I have to again get this cotton sari, Mother's instruction."  A man knocked at my door and he said, "There are some sari's for sale would you like to see."  He brought in these sari's and he said, "I have a very nice silk sari for you, if you want you can take it and I'll give it very cheap."  And it was less than hundred, which you cannot get.  And he said then, "I was so amazed that it fits into Mothers price and how is it, you won't believe, you ask my wife, you ask my children they were all there."  But the fellow disappeared after that.  I don't know if it's a made up story.


But it has happened with Me a many a times, small, small things like that.  I went to Delhi once and I saw very beautiful Ganesha made of stone we call it serpentine, I don't know your serpentine is different from ours.  It's a very expensive stone and I enquired in the shop I said, "How much for a Ganesha?"  I thought I'll give to someone, some Sahaja Yogis I can give one.  And he said, "It was five hundred rupees."  I said, "If I give it to one then what will the others say, I'll have to buy all of these and there aren't enough."  When I came to Bombay, Gavin and all that is not here, you were there, I was amazed Modhi gave you presents of serpentines stone, this Ganesha.  I just started looking at it.  I said, "How did he get that."  He said he had gone to Rajasthan last year, he got them very cheap from there and he had kept them for the Sahaja Yogis from the England, coming from England.  You know I was so much enamored by the beauty of Sahaja that I just desired that I would like, and to each and every person he gave, he gave you also, you were there.  He gave you, you've got that one with you, you should show them.  And I just watched him you know, if I wanted this is five hundred rupees worth, and to one person if I give I have to give to all of them what will happen.  And he arranged which all of them got.  So the working of love is so clearly seen how it works out.  


(Delete - Yogini speaks to Shri Mataji.)


That's why little bit giving to others and taking from others is important in Sahaja Yoga.  There's nothing wrong if you give to someone and you take from.  For example, you know that I also give lots of things because it's not the money that is important, it's not how much is spent but how you express your love through little things like giving flowers or anything that you give with love, it has such a meaning, it's a great thing otherwise what is all this matter, is useless.  But it has a meaning when it has that feeling behind it, then it becomes great.  It's like a mirror which is a, (Break in tape restarts) if you put the mercury behind then it becomes a mirror, it starts reflecting.  In the same way anything which has that feeling it acts like a mirror and then it starts reflecting, the love and the beauty of that person, you see.  


There're two nice stories about giving and one about Rama and one about Krishna but I don't know if I've told you about Rama stories and the Shabari and all the aboriginal women who were there and she gave the kind of a fruit like berries after testing them with her teeth, to Ram.  Every fruit she took out tested in nicely, I mean ate them in the sense that she pierced them with her teeth, to see they were sour or not and then they kept them collected in a bunch, I mean in a basket.  And when He came you see, she took them to Rama and she said to him, "Please," I mean first she talked to all the leaves and all the trees and everyone that, "Give me the best fruit all right, He's coming now and I've adored Him, I've praised for Him and now He's coming so give me the best fruits."  


Then she collected all those things and she was waiting for Him and when He came she washed His feet and made Him sit down and then she offered it.  She said, "Every piece I've tasted so you can eat all of them because they're not at all sour.  So Rama sat down and started eating, "Oh what a nice thing, really I've never eaten such fruits, never in My life I've had such good fruits.  What taste, it is very immensely delicious," and Lakshman the brother was getting very angry with her that what is this.  In India what is regarded as uttishth you see if somebody has eaten something it's just for that person (inaudible), your not suppose to eat that and this lady had done all that (inaudible ) and he was enjoying it.  


So He told His wife, Sita, he said "Oh, I cannot give you anything out of this, if You want to have more You should ask her to get more.  But I will never share any."  So Sita says, "No, no, no little bit less. You also enjoy, what is this, Your going to enjoy everything.  It's no good after all I am Your ardhangani, I'm Your half personality so You cannot eat the whole, You have to give Me little bit."  (inaudible) she tells Her brother-in-law, She says, "You see (inaudible).  Said, "I'm not going to give You anything even if You ask for it, I'm not going to give You can ask Your brother."  His brother said, "No I've shared with You but why should I share with Him, You can share with Him why should I share, this is so great you see."  And She was praising and praising, then Lakshman said, "(inaudible)."  She says, "All right I will give you only few."  Rama says, "All right first you eat then I will see how much I can eat."  Then She counted and gave Him, completely (inaudible), something I don't know, it's like amrut, amrut is the fruit of nectar.  I just cannot imagine such a thing.  He asked Rama, "After all You cannot be that selfish You are My elder brother You have to share Your things with Me.  (Inaudible) and they started you see, quarreling about it.  Such a beautiful description in the Ramayana of shabari, shabari Prem(love)the base of shabari, this is one of the things.


The second is when Shri Krishna became the king. He had a friend who was a something of a (inaudible) when Krishna was studding this friend, Sudama was studying with Him, you see both were great friends.  Then Krishna became a great king and Sudama became a poor Brahmin living in Dwarika.  And a, so he said, "I must go and see the king, and though He's my friend He won't recognize me, so doesn't matter but I must go and meet him after so many years I'm going to meet Him, so I must go and some how I'll find ways of meeting the king."  


So he said now he asked his wife, "Is there anything in the house that I can take for him to eat."  She said, "We are so poor what do we have to give to a king, we don't have anything."  He said, "All right, if we don't have anything at least he'll be having," that we eat as called as something chuda that is made from the rice, pounded rice the, you see, he must have eaten that sort of a thing, very cheap stuff.  


So he said, "All right give me a little bit of that and I'll take it."  She said, "I'm so ashamed of your self, your going to see a king and here your are you haven't got proper cloths and your taking this chuda for him, this a, even you wouldn't take to your poor friend and a king are you supposed to take this chuda?"  He said, "What ever it is now then I must take something.  I can't go like this after all I meeting My friend for so many years, I have not meet him, after all I'm going as a friend and as children he used to enjoy everything so I will take."  So he tied it up in a small little bundle put it in his shirt, with covering cloth that he used.  And he was a very poor man with all his bones and his thin body wearing a dhoti and little covering cloth, and he rested it under that covering cloth and went to see Him.  Sudama knew Krishna and Krishna knew that he was going to come.  


He had told his wife, He had five wives that time, these were the five elements you see.  He said, "My great friend is coming, you all have to make all the preparations for his bath, for his food and he's to be treated like the greatest VIP and there's to be not mistake at all, you plan it out properly."  He says, "Any mistake and you have to wash his feet and wipe his feet with you hair, so clean you hair first of all."  To the Queen can you imagine?  All these orders were on and He had told all the people that, "There's a friend of mine who's going to come."  All the people were informed, guards were informed that a friend of Shri Krishna (inaudible)  They thought he'll come on a elephant you see, with a big trumpet blowing in style (inaudible) coming, after all, Sudama.  So here Sudama walks you see with his little thing hiding here.  A thin, lean, short gentleman and knocks at the door.  So the guard asks, "Who are you?  Why are you coming here just now (inaudible ) arranged because Shri Krishna friend  is coming and we are all waiting for Him and where are you going you look like a beggar?"  He said, "All right which friend is coming?"  He said, "Somebody is coming so you don't worry now."  He said, "All right but please go and tell Shri Krishna that your friend Sudama has come, will you have sometime to see Me tomorrow."  He said, "Are you Sudama?"  He Said, "Oh God, we are sorry (inaudible)  They opened the door, Oh God you are Sudama why didn't you, we are sorry sir, we are very sorry."  They said, "We never knew you are(sounds like- Sudama."  And then the news went up, "Sudama has come."  Shri Krishna has gone for his retirement and (inaudible) heard is it true, or this is a fact.  He ran, "Oh my friend has come."  


He ran all the way, He ran from the staircases, He ran, you see, so this thing was wearing, that dhoti as we call it was all falling out and He was running and holding it and running that His friend has come and He went and embraced the pure (inaudible).  And He said, "After many years you have not even remembered me  (inaudible) in his own place (inaudible, sounds like - he sat next to him).  And this fellow was feeling very shy you see, with his torn cloths and all that.  So he said that, "Now you have to tell me one thing first of all, my sister in law, is Sudama's wife, must have give you something for Me.  He said, "No, no, you see, what can we bring for you are a king."  He said, "No that's not possible, what (inaudible), there must be, must be something.  (inaudible - now how do you eat it? )


(Delete  Yogi interrupts Shri Mataji.  Mother asks "Is it a present?"  "No it a plate."  It's a plate.  Shri Mother speaks to yogini. Thanks her for the present. ) 


So Krishna was after him, he said, "No, no you have tell me what has she sent for Me."  "No she has not given anything."  He said, " Now  what are you hiding under that cloth of yours?"  He said, "You know nothing, nothing."  So he pulled it out.  He said, "Oh this is what she sent for Me," and he opened it, "This I'm not going to give to anyone," and He started eating like a glutton, whole thing started with both the hands.  So Sudama said, "(inaudible) are just the same the same size (inaudible)."  I said, "What do You mean, You want it, I'm not going to give you."  So he looks at her (inaudible).  He told his wife, "You don't look at him, don't feel jealous, I'm not going to give her anything out of it even a drop.  So the (inaudible) says, "Don't you think you deserve a little of this."  "All right if something falls down you can have it, but not from my hand I will not give.  It is such a precious thing, is so tasty, is so beautifully done you cannot get it in the whole world like this."  


So the (inaudible) knew what it was.  He said. "Little bit if you give us as a prasad into (inaudible)  So Sudama said, "Don't be so selfish, after all it's not that good your just bluffing, why don't you give."  He said, "I'm not bluffing."  And then he gave it to them and they (inaudible) what is this(inaudible) what is this (inaudible) and they really all enjoyed.  And then he said, "Now you have had a bath you had a nice sleep now don't (inaudible) every one might tell so we are going to take you out in a procession.  So he made good cloths for him and he said, "Now we are all going to go out, celebrate."  He said' "No (inaudible) my cloths are all right."  He said, "No for my sake, it won't look nice if, I'll wear your cloths you wear mine."  So he took his cloths and he made him wear his own cloths.  He said, "No, no, no, now you wear your cloths and I can wear these,' and he got into the procession.  Now there's a person in India that, when a procession is take out, of a bride or a bridegroom, they put money or something just to take out the bad eye, you see.  (inaudible) calling as (sounds like-minsarie) they just start throwing on people like, coins and things and, like that.  So Krishna was throwing jewels and pearls just to take out his bad eye you see, just could not be any bad eye on His friend.  So He had asked them to put.  Now the poor Brahmin, Shudama was thinking not even one has fallen into my lap and He's chasing off my bad eye.  Look at Him, why doesn't he (inaudible) like that, that at least one should fall in my lap and the rest He's throwing it to others taking out my bad eyes, and that people should not have bad eyes on me.  So he distributed this to the poor, but I'm the poorest of poor I can't.

...one out of that and Sita was smiling.  Then after the whole procession was over and then eating was over and then they had food and everything then next morning he said, "Now I must go back to my wife."  So when he went back he went in the same dress the he had come.  (inaudible) nice his house was (sounds like-waiting) everything was (sounds like -looking) what has happened.  There was a very very beautiful (sounds like - salad) there.  He just stood there and all people started coming.  He/They said, "You are our master please come in this is your own house, and his wife also excepted (inaudible) and all that.  He started looking at, "How is it that this is my house and you are my wife (inaudible) and these are my children.  Krishna himself came here and did all this when you were sleeping.  You can imagine the love of (inaudible) there for that.  And then he was eating he said, "I cannot compensate this thing, this joy that I'm getting, even if I could give these palaces up, (inaudible) this feeling.  See the beauty and the joy.  (inaudible)  So you see the people living in this is something.  They said, "It's all right sir we don't mind but (inaudible- very poor sound quality) 


There's another one (sounds like - gadarfi) gadaha means, in hindi language gadha means a donkey.  Really, gadarfi.  



((DELETE Some one asks a question - (inaudible)



Shri Mataji (inaudible)


Someone continues to speak 


There's another market which is of flowers, which is that called as.  (sounds like - Covent) garden.  Is the same thing is a continuation Covent Garden, all right so.  


Someone speaks to Shri Mataji.)


See now, send it with flowers you see.  Send it with flowers it was so nice, but I knew something would happen (inaudible) in the flower garden even when you go there, you see (inaudible).  They are pretty things and it will work out much faster than anywhere else.  I'll have to go there one day.  What beautiful flowers, really I mean.  


(Delete- Some one speaks to Shri Mataji, then reads out verse/poetry -deleted from your copy to fit transcription on tape.)

(Delete - Shri Mataji speaks -mostly inaudible- not part of talk, seems to be personal comments to yogis)
Very, very poor sound quality on tape at this point.


You are not Sahaja Yogis and one who are Sahaja Yogis, can you find any (sounds like third).  I mean the second category which is all useful/ useless to put together, from rakshasas to (sounds like- elite), so all of them on one side, Sahaja Yogis on the other.  So anything, you see both ways (sounds like - as a scripture) is the (inaudible) because they're not authorized, if this is understood everybody (inaudible).  Can you imagine what (inaudible,) so to claim that you're a Sahaja Yogi as just now they've found to be awakened, to arise, and not be ashamed to say that.  Go out, all out to say that we are realized souls.  Like that only, that they said if you're a realized soul you should be able to build a pyramid, are they mad?
