Conversation with Yogis, Roissy Airport, Paris (France), 19 June 1983.

[Cut in the audio]
...You see, this is the time when I’m facing people who are [Cut in the audio]
So I have to tackle those problems so I’m paying attention, it goes to drug.
Somebody might say that: “Why didn’t Muhammad say about drugs?” You see, at the time of Muhammad, there were no smoking. So, he didn’t talk about smoking. So, the Muslims smoke like that, you see. When Nanaka came, he told that: “Don’t smoke and don’t drink.” Precisely.

"Samayatcha". "Samaya" means "time" and "achar" means "behaving". And Muhammad clearly said about the Resurrection time many years. He has talked about Resurrection much more than he talked Doomsday and he said: “At the time of Resurrection, your hands will speak clearly. And next the feet will start to speak.”

Sahaja Yogi: And your feet also.
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Sahaja Yogi: He said: "[Arabic words]". This is in the Koran: your feet and your hands will talk.
Shri Mataji: And, hands and feet will talk, speak.

Translator [in French]: And your hands will speak. The feet, the feet!
[Laughter]
Shri Mataji [to the translator]: That’s it?
Translator: Yes, yes.

Shri Mataji: Now. But, you see, these Muslims are using more the Doomsday and same thing with Christians. They don’t want to talk about the Counsellor but they want to talk about the last Kalki so just to frighten the people. If you frighten the people, then they will stick onto this. It’s a business proposition. That’s why it happened like that. And moreover, you see, now, at the time when all these Incarnations came in, they came on one centre, on one area, like all the Prophets came only on the Void.
But while, in this case [in Shri Mataji’s case] there are seven chakras, so all the permutations and combinations are there because Adi Shakti is the master of all the chakras, you see. So, She is the One who can really give Realization otherwise, others can’t. And they did what was worth needed at that time, on that chakra.

Like the five books of the Bible that you have, Torah, all the five books are common to three of them: Christians, Jews and Muslims. So, the Muslims accept the five books and out of that, they accepted the sharias, that is all in the Bible, whether Jew or Christian or anyone. And it was whatever was said, just to establish with fear the dharma.
But later on, you see that all the other people added their own like Torah has got additions from the Jews, then the Christians had the New Testament, then also the Muslims add the Koran about Muhammad. But you see, Muhammad definitely accepted Christ. Only thing they said that Muhammad had said that: “I am the last to come here as the Prophet.” He accepted all the Prophets of the world.
4:55

But, you see, he must have found out that the world is so hectic [unsure], [Shri Mataji laughs] he has been so much misused so he came back again as Guru Nanak. It’s the fanatism, you see, which makes you so upset. Last time, as I told to Americans, I’ll never come to America. But I’m going back. [Laughter]
Maire-Laure: Maybe because also the seekers are calling you.
Shri Mataji: Yes, they are calling Me, but they don’t know whom they are calling.
It’s a problem. Let’s see. Their Agnya is a problem, you see. Really disappointing, because they have no roots, thy have no roots. Very shameless. Even the old people are so stupid, I don’t know what to do, very stupid.

Arnaut was telling Me that even very old women will wear such sharp heels [Laughter] But I once saw a program arranged for the old people from Hollywood, very old, all shaking like this. All above eighty, ninety years with all the ripples you could count one by one. And they were having a dance you could as “shaky”, absolutely stupid! And Dany, you see, agrees because he has been there.
[Shri Mataji laughs] And you all have to give the vibrations. And we have some nice people now, Allan- Nick you have met Allan here.
Nick: Yes Mother.
Shri Mataji: Allan is American.
Marie-Laure: Mother
Shri Mataji: Hum.
Marie-Laure: You know that Tracy is pregnant now.
Shri Mataji: No, I didn’t know.
Marie-Laure: She’s pregnant, yes.
Shri Mataji: Ho, very good.
Marie-Laure: Just about three months.
Shri Mataji: Ho, that’s good. When I’ll be there, she’ll be busy.

Sahaja Yogi: Yes, we may be busy when we go back moving, cause, I think the first, they’re selling the house that we live in. So, when we get back, we may live somewhere else I don’t know.
Shri Mataji: What?
Sahaja Yogi: When we get back we may move.
Sahaja Yogini: Maybe they are selling the house that we are renting. It’s now sold, we think. We’ll find out when we get back. So, we’ll move maybe into a [?] house.
Shri Mataji: It’s better.
Sahaja Yogi: Hopefully.
Sahaja Yogini: It would be better.

Sahaja Yogi: Mother? Maybe what could be good is that each country can afford to send maybe one people from their country to America.
Shri Mataji: It’s quite problematical, you see, but there are some people coming, you see, because I wish some people could come, but last time, you see, we had to take a hotel and this and that. But now of course we have some people who can accommodate you.

They too have very large apartments. Let’s see what happens because Modi is coming. He wants to take a house in New York.
Sahaja Yogini: So he wants to come into New York?
Shri Mataji: Of course, he’s going to settle down in New York.
Sahaja Yogi: Rajesh Modi Mother?
Shri Mataji: Radja bhaya. For some times, for Americans. Indians are also sending their own representatives. He’s very powerful.
Now, we should not miss the plane after coming for one hour earlier.
They all push Me out absolutely!
How much time?
Sahaja Yogi: Thirty minutes.
Shri Mataji: Ten minutes we can.
When you are here, I’m quite safe.
[Laughter]
Sahaja Yogini: It’s the other way round Mother.
Shri Mataji: Now we have people in customs, we have people everywhere. Even in the police.
Last time one gentleman, you remember, who was in India, started quarrelling with Me that –he was from TM- and he said: “You’d better return all my money.” I said: ‘Suddenly, I can’t give you money, even if I give you, you can’t exchange it, you see.” So, he couldn’t believe Me and everybody was against it, they said: “Mother, we have already paid for him. You see, suddenly, in between, if he wants to go, why should you pay him money back?” And they told him that: “Why don’t you get your money from TM now?”
You see, actually, I’ve sent the money and -to Delhi - so, I was really in a fix, I didn’t know what to do. I said: “All right, baba, I’ll pay you from my own.” But they were all against it.

Because only I lend fifty pounds. But I said: “If I give you cash money now, you can’t carry it, Indian money, you can’t, because Indian money cannot be converted.”

He wouldn’t believe. So, I said: “You can go ahead if you want to go then I’ll see it in England.” So, he went to the airport – no, he gave away all my photographs, books, everything. And he also demanded money for that also, for the photographs. But negativity, you see, works the other way round also. So, just to test Me, he went to the airport and then he tried to exchange his seven hundred rupees and they became very suspicious. So, they asked him: “Where will you stay?” So, he said: “I was staying in such and such place.” They said: “It’s not possible, it’s for marriages, how can you come for a marriage place? How can you stay there? It’s not full Moon. Then all the customs got after him then. They thought he was a smuggler. And then all the police came in.
So, then he told that: “I was with Mataji Nirmala Devi, I’ve been travelling and all that.” So, we have an inspector of police also, a Sahaja Yogi very strong, Kulkani. He told me the whole story he said; “About two o’clock [a.m.] a telephone call came to me that there is some Mataji’s disciple, please come and verify.” So, Kulkani went to the airport and he said: “If it is a Mataji’s disciple, he must be wearing a ring or a necklace or must be a photograph maybe with him or one flyer. [Big Laughter] on him. It must be there something has to be there. And without a photograph, nobody travels, no Sahaja Yogi travels.” And he said:” I don’t have any.” Then Kulkani said: “I don’t know this man.” So, poor fellow missed his plane. And next day he had to go through lots of various inquiries, this, that. And then he came out of it. Because they thought he is a very uncertain person. So, this is how it works out.

So, I was talking about that security, you see, that the customs people are there, now he [Dany] is in the airport and in Bombay, most of the customs officers are Realised souls. You just have my photograph on top of your luggage. You can pass through. Suzanne told Me that in Delhi she was coming, you see, and they suspected her. So, they wanted to open her bag.
Translator: Linda.
Shri Mataji: No, no, no, Suzanne. Yes. And I think silver is not allowed to carry in from India or something. So, they opened her box. And on top of the box there was a big picture of mine kept. So, the custom officer said: “Namaste.” And he said: “I’m sorry.” [Big laughter.]
He said namaste to the photograph. And he closed the thing and he said: “I’m I did not know you where there.”
[Big laughter.]

Shri Majaji: How are you Dany? All right. Now, your place is Chelsea? [Unsure.]
Dany: Yes, yes, Mother.
Shri Majaji: Absolutely strained.
It’s all fun.
She was very much [inaudible] Poor thing, you know she was put in too much strain and then suddenly you start feeling that way.
Better go now.
....

Shri Mataji: You play very well your violin. Once, you have to see some Indian playing their violin, you know, they sit on the ground and play their violin. Have you seen any Indian playing violin?
Seeker: No.
Shri Mataji: They sit on the ground and put the violin, from here, on the feet there. And it’s very spontaneous, like jazz.
Marie-Laure: Beautiful when we had a concert in Nagpur Mother.
Shri Mataji: Ho! The blind?
Marie-Laure: Yes.
Shri Mataji: He’s absolutely blind.
Marie-Laure: Yes.
Shri Mataji: He’s a Sahaja Yogi.
Absolutely blind but he is a Sahaja Yogi.
Seeker: Do you think I can start Indian music?
Shri Mataji: Yes, you can start Indian music, it’s a good idea.
[inaudible]
Seeker: He lives in India
Shri Mataji: Yes, he lives in India this one. But I tell you the name of the one who has played.
[inaudible] You can get the records of this gentleman. P B J. P and J. Jo, means John.
You know, you can get the records of this gentleman. PB Jo with somebody else.
[People are chatting]

[Shri Mataji is leaving now]

Thank you very much, all of you, thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.
Now, be nice and sweet? All right?
Sahaja Yogi: All right.
Shri Mataji: All right. Bye, bye.

[Inaudible conversation]
Sahaja Yogis: Namaste Mother.
