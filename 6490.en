Shri Mataji: It’s all right, it’s ? I don’t need, I don’t need. It’s all right.

Shri Mataji: You can ask them, all of them, to sit; I think there are chairs here and there. Standing, what you can see here also? On the, on the? They can come on the stage. It’s a big stage, you know. They can come here, on the stage. Please come.

I bow to all the seekers of truth. At the very outset, at the very outset, we have to know that truth is what it is. We cannot think about it, we cannot read about it and we cannot conceptualize it. And also unfortunately at this human awareness we cannot feel it; we cannot know it. One has to rise above your physical, emotional and mental side. We have reached a stage of this human awareness through our evolution, but we do not know the absolute truth. This is the reason why there are so many theories coming up, so many dogmas, and there are fights, wars, all kinds of problems in this world.

Thanks to Mr. Gorbachev that the political wars may not take place. But fundamentalism is the biggest problem today. And we do not know how they work out their fundamentalism on our minds. It is very important now to understand because this is going to be the greatest problem for us and for our children. To get over the fundamentalism, the only way is your ascent. Then you will realise that all these great incarnations and these prophets all were born on the same tree of spirituality. They were born at different times but teaching the same principles of a universal religion. But the fundamentalists do not like to have, accept, the religion which is one in the whole world, which is a religion which is innate, which is within us. You may be a Christian, Hindu, Muslim, anything; you can commit any sin. What have people achieved by following a particular religion, I don’t understand.

Let us take the case of Christianity. I was Myself born in the Christian religion and I was surprised to see Mr. Paul in the Bible. He was not the apostle of Christ. He had nothing to do with Christ and he is occupying such an important position. He had killed a disciple of Christ stealing and also he was epileptic. We can show that epilepsy comes only through possessions. But when he saw such a good platform for him, he decided to use it for his own fame. So he wanted to find out somebody who would be weak enough to join him in doing all kinds of wrong things. The weakest disciple of Christ was Peter. Christ hadtold him that a Satan will take over, and it did happen that this Paul took over him. And he made such an ado out of him, saying that Christ gave him the keys to build the church. He made a big ado out of him to say that the Christ told Peter that, “You build your church and I give you the key.” Now see the logic: how can Christ ask the weakest disciple whom he had said that Satan will take over, appoint him as the head of a church? Between these two persons, they decided to re-edit Bible. Of course, they had done lot of wrong but despite that there are lots of truths also in the Bible. They opposed matters for Immaculate Conception.

Thomas had to run away to India because he could not bear it. He wrote his treatise and put them in Cairo which are now found out, and you’ll be surprised to see that Bible that he had written is very, very different. He has talked about the Primordial Mother. Also he has talked about Sahaja Yoga in a way that this has to be a spontaneous experience. Then poor John, he wouldn’t write the treatise. So they made somebody else to write. They made somebody else write, but also there is lot of truth in what he has written.

So now when these fundamentalists say that there is no place for women, they are absolutely wrong. In the Bible they showed no respect for Mary, for Mother Mary. She was born Madonna, by the religions which were before that, like pagan religions. They, too, were describing a Goddess, and that is why they called Her Madonna. And She was a Goddess, much higher than all these popes put together. But it was denied. They had God the Father and God the Son. No Mother. They couldn’t accept a feminine, who could be a divine personality, who could be God.

Another nonsense they wrote was about, was the original sin. Christ went to attend a wedding, in that short period. Was he there to support a original sin? And He did not make the wine; he touched the water and it became grape juice. It can be done. And you know very well that wine means it has to ferment and rot for some time. A very great poet and a great divine personality in London, who was very well-regarded as a mad person in those days, is William Blake. He said, “A priest has cursed me on my fontanel.”

Same about Hindu scriptures. In the Hindu scriptures it is described that everybody has the Spirit in their heart. If everybody has the Spirit, how can you have caste system? Even Shri Krishna has said very clearly that this, they write it, did that, you see, it’s such a, that it is prenatal, the caste is prenatal, means you are born with the caste. How can it be? Because the one who wrote “Gita” himself was an illegitimate child of a fisherwoman. She was not a Brahmin. He was not a Brahmin. Same with “Ramayana”. Rama’s episode was written by Valmiki, who was another dacoit who became a good man, transformed himself and wrote “Ramayana”. He was a dacoit. So, even Koran was not written by Mohamed Sahib. For forty years it was remembered by his friends in their brains and afterwards they couldn’t, again, they couldn’t put it down because they did not know how to write. So they told their children to write it down, after forty years. Still Mohammed Sahib was a great incarnation.

They all have talked of second birth, of Self-Realisation. When Christ has said, “You have to be born again,” clearly He said it. So some people take a brand, “We are born again”, “We are Christians”, “We are Hindus”. It’s just a brand. It has nothing to do with that.

In Sanskrit, there is a word for “twice born”; is ‘dvijaha’, means “twice born”. A bird is called dvijaha, also a person who is a realised soul, because bird is born as an egg, then it becomes a bird; actually becomes a bird. Also a human being is born with a limited awareness. Then he becomes unlimited. That is the second birth. But you are satisfied with some kind of a brand on your heads. Go ahead. That is not going to give you peace, contentment and the joy of the Divine. One has to achieve that state of Self-Realisation.

Sahaja Yoga is a very simple method of attaining that state, by which you become the Spirit. Before realisation, your Spirit is a witness of your behaviour. And after realisation, then your Spirit comes into, manifestsinto your attention. When it manifests in your attention, then your attention itself becomes active. For example, a person who is a realised soul, his eyes become pure and innocent. Christ has said, “Thou shall not have adulterous eyes.” It’s very difficult to find a Christian with a, not adulterous eyes, it’s difficult. So, these eyes which are all the time filled with lust and greed, suddenly quieten and they become pure, innocent and powerful. This is the Power of divine love. When such a person even glances at someone, he can raise the Kundalini of that person. He can give satisfaction to that person. He can give the meaning of life to that person.

So the truth is, you are not this body, this mind, these thoughts, these emotions, these conditionings, but you are pure Spirit. And another truth is that there is an All-pervading Power of divine love, which does all divine work, all living work. See now we have beautiful flowers here. We take them for granted. It’s a miracle. We don’t even think. Look at our eyes. What a camera! Look at our brain. What a computer! But we just take it for granted. For us these are not miracles. Who does this work? Doctors say that our heart is run by autonomous nervous system. Who is this auto? Who is the one who does all this living work? All genes, who produces? There must be some power. After realisation, the Kundalini connects you to that power. Like this instrument, if it is not connected to the mains, has no meaning. We have no meaning unless and until we feel that All-pervading Power.

It is not a mental thing, but it’s a happening and it is also becoming. And that becoming, if takes place, then you all have the power to raise the Kundalini, to cure the people, to do so many things, that I think I cannot describe in this short lecture. Those people who have now ascended have solved all their problems. We have three doctors in India who have got MD showing how some of the incurable diseases are cured by them. Sahaja Yoga definitely can cure cancer and many other diseases which cannot be cured. You’ll know on your fingertips all the problems that you have in your centres. All the world problems are because of human beings, and all the human problems are because of these centres. If you can know, if you can find out how to cure these centres, you have solved your problem and you can solve the problem of others. Sometimes it acts very fast. I’ve seen people getting rid of their drugs and other habits overnight, overnight. And for all this we don’t have to pay. You can’t pay it. God doesn’t send money to Swiss Bank. He doesn’t know banks. You don’t have to pay for it because it is a living process. How much do we pay to Mother Earth for creating these flowers? It is built-in, in Her nature, built-in in the seeds that you get the results. Why all the religions have failed? Because they became money-orientated or power-orientated. They were never, never spirit-orientated. With this kind of an approach, how can you reach the state of Spirit? You may have money, you may mint money, you may counterfeit money, but you cannot counterfeit the Spirit.

So the interest of people who are thinking that there must be something beyond is to seek the truth. There are many seekers of truth; in Russia especially I was surprised, thousands. They know their main problem is now because they have now no faith in communism. So they think they will fall into fundamentalism. And also many communist Arabs have approached Me that, “Now we have lost faith in communism and we don’t want to fall into fundamentalism to fight with this Saddam Hussein.”

We have had the freedom, so-called, in the democracies. Freedom without wisdom is very dangerous. I’ve met a lady in a very elite personality, in one of the parties, and I asked her, “Why are you now taking to drugs?” So she said that, “It is new. That is why I am taking drugs and I’m free to take it.” Same with Freud; people took to Freud headlong. He was the greatest fraud ever born. There’s an organization called ADFI, which is a fundamentalist organization, that is, they are Catholic Church, but they consult Freudian, what you call, psychologist – is Freudian. And the Freudian believe in freedom which is anti-Christ.

So what a contradiction it is. Where there is Christianity they accepted Freud, and it became way of life. It became the style of life and it has created such a malignant effect on the culture. I’ve never ever thought. There is a very nice book, after so many years, that has come out about fraudulent Freud. Can you believe that this kind of a theory that he started and had psychoanalyses has no scientific bases at all? He himself was a possessed man and he was possessed by someone that he had relations with his own mother. One gentleman said, ‘Thank God that he did not come to India. Otherwise we would have made pieces out of his body and thrown him in the sea.” How dare he say about the holy relationships between the son and the mother? There is no wisdom in this kind of nonsense, that we accept everything that comes. It is complete slavery. Like in Paris they have six inches now of skirts. So in the cold weather also they’re wearing six inches of skirts to get varicose veins. You can’t get long skirts, even in winter. They say you are Turkish if you wear long skirts, can you imagine? All kinds of nonsense that starts, people just accept it.

Perhaps daily I think too much of television and bombardment on our heads. Our heads are becoming absolutely empty. Not only in this, but also in so many respects our freedom has been ruined our society. Also I think the effect of Hollywood.

Translator: Hollywood?

Shri Mataji: I mean, they’re all right for acting, but as far as brains are concerned, they are stupid people. Ninety-year-old people going for a dance from Hollywood, shake dance. They’re already shaking.

Even art, so vulgar, because they have no artistic talent, so vulgar. In Russia I met so many foreigners who came from Europe to see Rembrandt, because there are twenty-six Rembrandts in the Hermitage, twenty-six. Just to see Rembrandt which is bigger. Even today Mona Lisa is so popular. But what about these modern artists who are doing all vulgarity? Where will it take you tomorrow?

So one has to understand that there’ssomething weare missing even inour own personality. How could we accept all this nonsense, all these? The only way we can now really have our wisdom is by ascent. We can get out of all kinds of ignorance only by our ascent. Firstly, you know absolute truth. Now here there are many Sahaja Yogis. You ask them about one person, what is he suffering from, they’ll all say the same thing, same thing. No question of dispute or argument. They have been all, in these, all these problems, but they have become like angels. It’s not Me; it’s they. Their own power has made them. All of you have this dignity and this innocence in you, absolutely intact.

If you are really seeking the truth from your heart you will find it. It is not a sermon, it is not a lecture but it is a promise to you, that today you will find it. Then you just jump into the ocean of joy. You become extremely dynamic and extremely compassionate and very powerful. Now I am seventy years of age and I am travelling every day. So that’s what happens. You feel that you have now no problems, no worries, nothing. And you start looking after others. It’s like one candle can enlighten another candle. You can enlighten thousands of them.

I’ll say that Geneva is like the sternum bone where the centre heart is, where the immunity system is built in and where there are all the anti-bodies created. Surprisingly, from Geneva people have gone even to South America, like Argentina, Peru, Colombia, Brazil, from Geneva. Even to Russia and to all the places, people have come from Geneva. They got their realisation here and they went. They were mostly foreigners. Swiss were less, I must say also. But now I see lots of Swiss and I hope they will understand their responsibility living in Geneva and it will work out.

In this little time I can’t tell you everything about Sahaja Yoga. Only in English language I must be having about four to five thousand tapes. I’ve not yet written any book because book means again you become book-worm.

So, one has to just get the enlightenment. See these lights on top of your head: you have to just switch on. One switch and they all come, because it is all built in. But if I have to tell you everything about electricity, how it has come till you are, it will be very boring. So the best thing is to ask for your enlightenment. I said “ask” because I cannot cross over your freedom of choice, because I respect your freedom. If you have to have the ultimate freedom about everything, then your human freedom has to be respected. So it will take about ten to fifteen minutes for you to get your Self-Realisation, but after that you must remember that this is a collective happening. That means it’s like you become part and parcel of the whole. The microcosm becomes the macrocosm. You have to come to the collective and work it out, your connection, in such a way that it is established. And then you’ll be amazed how many things you know and how deeply you can understand this subtle subject.

At the very outset I have to tell you that those who do not want to have their Self-Realisation should please leave this hall and not to disturb others. I was told that there are some people who came outside just to disturb our way. They can take a hall and talk. We don’t do that. We don’t go to this cheap type of obstructions. This is, this is hooliganism. If you want to talk about yourself or to propagate your ideas, you can take a hall and do it and see how many people come. But what’s the use of coming like football hooligans and disturbing people who want to have their realisation? So those who want to have their Self-Realisation should be here, because I respect your freedom. But during the time of realisation, please don’t disturb others. And all of you have to do this process. At least you will yourself nourish your own centres. You have to nourish your own centres and that can be done very easily.

The difference between Russians and Europeans is so great that I am really shocked at that. I mean, they would not have those gurus. They would not have these fake gurus? None of them. No guru and they, you will be surprised that they have never heard My name, nothing, first time I went to Leningrad. And the hall was for four thousand; it was all full and outside there were five thousand waiting. And they all got realisation. But the outside ones still sitting out. I said, they said, “What about us, Mother?” I said, “All right, come tomorrow in the morning and we’ll have it in the grounds here.” And those five thousand sitting outside and four thousand sitting inside, all of them came with more. And they all sat on the ground and got their realisation and they are all there. I was quite surprised because I said, “How is it you have accepted Me so fast?” They said, “We have, we have sensitivity to spirituality.” Also, they’re very introspective, very introspective. And in Russia also there is freedom, but it is not a lifestyle. Freedom is allowed, but it is not a lifestyle at all. The whole of Eastern bloc and Russia, you won’t believe, the people are so sensitive. In one small place called Togliatti there are twenty-two thousand Sahaja Yogis practicing. I’ve been only there thrice and Geneva, I don’t know, sixteen times I must have been or maybe more. A day may come that this Eastern bloc will take over. It looks like that. They have a very good divine discretion. It’s very remarkable.

All right. So now, first, I must tell you there are three conditions. First is that you all should be confident that you will all get your Self-Realisation and that too, tonight. Now do not have any melancholic ideas about yourself. Now do not feel guilty. This is a Catholic Church blessings, that you feel guilty. Nobody has to feel guilty just now, because this All-pervading Power is the ocean of forgiveness. Whatever mistakes you might have committed can be easily dissolved by this ocean. Do you know, when you feel guilty the centre here on the left side catches and you get diseases like angina, spondylitis and also lethargic organs. Also Kundalini won’t rise because the chakra will become completely constricted. To feel guilty, it’s just mental. When you think you have committed mistake just face it and finish down. Don’t put it here. Also is a fashion to indulge or to enjoy, indulge into sort of a tragedy or what you call the Greek tragedy. Now we are entering into the Kingdom of God. So please I request you not to feel guilty at all. After all, you are human beings; you are not gods. If you have done mistakes, it’s all right. So just forgive yourself, and have full confidence in yourself.

The third condition is even simpler, that you have to forgive each and every person, without thinking about them, in general. Actually, logically whether you forgive or don’t forgive, you don’t do anything. But when you don’t forgive, then you play into wrong hands. You torture yourself for nothing at all. Those who have troubled you are very happy and you are torturing yourself uselessly]. Logically it is nonsense. It is just a mental, mental thing we are torturing. And also don’t think about them; it’s a headache. Moreover, if you do not forgive, this centre of the optic chiasma is like that, on the optic chiasma in the brain, is like this, is very constricted, very constricted. But when you forgive it opens like this, opens like this, and also you will feel very light, when you forgive all of them. If this centre doesn’t open the Kundalini will not piece through the fontanel. As soon as She pierces through this Agnya Chakra, then you become thoughtlessly aware. And then the air comes out of your head and you can feel the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost coming. Because Holy Ghost is not a dogma; it’s a Primordial Mother, and She’s reflected in us as Kundalini. Is the pure desire, which once awakened, you become one with this All-pervading Power. This Kundalini is your individual, your own Mother. She knows everything about you and She is very anxious to give you realisation.

So these are three conditions. If you follow, then it will take hardly any time for you to get realisation, and your life-long search will be over. You have to have pure desire. It is not meant for arrogant people but for humble people. Christ has said that earth will be owned by the people who are humble in heart.

All right. So now we have to take out our shoes. It helps a lot. This Mother Earth helps us a lot. Now you have to be comfortable. Don’t have to go to Himalayas, don’t have to fast, don’t have to do anything. It’s just within you.

Now we have, I don’t know if you have been told that we have three, three channels, right and left. The left channel is the one that is the power of desire, of ordinary desire, and the right one is the power of action. So our left and right foot we keep apart from each other. We sit comfortably, straight, neither slouching on behind. Put your left hand towards Me; that symbolically means that you want to have realisation. Please put your left hand left hand towards Me like this, comfortably on your lap. If you like you can put it on these benches or you can, on the bench is all right. And the right hand is to be used for nourishing your centres.

First we put our right hand on the heart, because in the heart is reflected God Almighty as Spirit . If you become the Spirit you become your own guide, your own master, your own guru. So now we put our hand, we work only on the left hand side on the upper portion of our abdominal on the left hand side. This is the centre of your mastery. Now you move your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. This is the centre of divine knowledge, of pure knowledge.

All right. Again we take our right hand in the upper portion of our abdomen. Then we take our right hand to our heart. Now in the corner of our neck and shoulder, as I told you, and we turn our head to our right. Now we take our hand on top of our forehead across like this and put down our head. Put it down. This is the centre to forgive everyone. We do it later fully. Just now I will tell you how to do it. Then we take our right hand on the back side of the head and push back our head as far as possible. This is the centre where, without feeling guilty, without counting mistakes, just for your satisfaction, you have to ask for forgiveness from the Divine Power.

Now stretch your hand fully, all of you. Please do it. Why don’t you do it? Stretch your hand. Put the centre of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area. Right hand, right hand, not left, right one. Now push back your fingers, nicely. And please put down your head. Now here you have to move the scalp with the pressure, clockwise, slowly, seven times. Please move it. Push back your fingers; push back. Put down your head; put down your head. Seven times, move it, one, two, like that. Not the hand, as the scalp, more. That’s all you have to do.

Now we have to close our eyes, and please don’t open them till I tell you. You can take out your spectacles. Now, please put your left hand towards Me and both the feet apart from each other. And now put right hand on your heart and please close your eyes. Here, I’ve already told you, resides the Spirit. You can call Me Mother, or you can call Me Shri Mataji, and ask Me a very fundamental question about yourself, three times. So ask a question, “Mother, am I the Spirit ?” Ask three times this question, in your heart.

I’ve told you that when you become the Spirit , you become your own master. So now, please take your right hand in the upper portion of your abdominal on the left hand side and press it. Here again you have to ask a question three times, in your heart, “Mother, am I my own master?”

Now I cannot force pure knowledge on you. You have to ask for it, because I respect your freedom. Now please take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdominal and push it, put your fingers inside. Here you have to say six times, because this centre has got six petals, “Mother, please give me pure divine knowledge.” As soon as you ask for pure knowledge, the Kundalini starts rising upward.

So we have to nourish our upper centres with our full confidence. So now raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. Here you have to say with full confidence, ten times, “Mother, I am my own master.”

I’ve already told you that the truth is, you are not this body, this mind, these conditionings, this ego, but you are the pure Spirit. So now raise your right hand on your heart and with full confidence, please say, twelve times, “Mother, I am the pure Spirit.”

This All-pervading Power is the ocean of compassion, love and blessings, it is the ocean of knowledge and joy, but above all it is the ocean of forgiveness. So whatever mistakes you might have committed, it can be easily dissolved in this power of, ocean of forgiveness. So forgive yourself and raise your right hand to the corner of your neck and turn your head to your right. Here you have to say sixteen times with full confidence, “Mother, I am not guilty at all.”

I have already told you logically, whether you forgive or you don’t forgive, you don’t do anything. But if you don’t forgive then you play into wrong hands and you torture yourself. So now please raise your right hand on your forehead across and put down your head. Here you have to say from your heart, not how many times, “Mother, I forgive everyone in general.” If you don’t say and if you don’t forgive, then this centre won’t open. The Kundalini won’t enter into your brain.

Now take your right hand on the back side of your head and push back your head. Here, without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, just for your satisfaction, you have to say, “Oh, Divine Power, if I have done any mistakes, please forgive me.” Say it from your heart, not how many times.

Now take your right hand and stretch it and put the centre of your right hand, right palm, on top of your fontanel bone area. Now put down your head. Please put down your head. Push back your fingers, very, very important. Now move your hands seven times, clockwise, but here again I cannot cross over your freedom. You have to ask for your Self-Realisation. So while moving your hand please say seven times, “Mother, please give me Self-Realisation.” [Mother blows seven times into the microphone].

Now please take down your hands. Now put your right hand and left hand, like this, towards Me. Open your eyes and now put your right hand and left hand like this and watch Me without thinking. Like this, not like this, like this, not like this, this way. Now please put down your head and see with your left hand if there is a cool or a hot breeze, like waves, coming out of your fontanel bone area, and right hand towards Me. And also the right hand towards Me. Now please put the left hand towards Me. And now bend your head again and see with your right hand. Sometimes you get quite close to your head and sometimes far away.

If it is hot coming out, that means, if it is coming out hot, that means you have not yet forgiven. So please forgive. Now again, once more, right hand towards Me and bend your head and see for yourself with left hand. Bend your head is important. Now, good, now please put both your hands towards the sky, push back your head and please ask a question, any one of these questions, three times, any one, “Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?” or “Mother, is this the All-pervading Power of Divine Love?” or “Mother, is this the Paramchaitanya?” Any one of these you can ask, three times.

Now bring down your hands, just put like that. All those who have felt cool breeze on their fingers or hot breeze on their fingers or on their palm or through the fontanel bone area, please raise both your hands. That’s Geneva. I bow to you. Your saintly life has started. Please come to the collective and know all about it. I will come after one year now. But I’m sure you will all grow like big trees of spirituality. You don’t have to pay for anything, whatsoever, but you have to respect your Self-Realisation.

May God Bless you! It’s your own. May God Bless you all!

[Mother speaks aside: So many people, I must say....already eleven o’ clock...There were so many, I can’t still imagine].

If you have any questions, you can write down the questions and bring it to the collective. But please go to the collective, I am telling you. Otherwise you will lose your vibrations. You’ll lose this feeling. This is the first time you have felt this All-pervading Power.
