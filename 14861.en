Ganesha Puja
Mumbai (India)
Talk Language: Hindi | Translation (Hindi to English) - VERIFIED

The vibratory sound which was produced when God Almighty began to create this universe is called Brahmnaad  (ब्रह्मनाद), or Omkar. This vibratory sound, which got spread in the world, was a sound of purity. First of all, God transmitted purity in this universe – purified the whole atmosphere. First, He purified. This purity is called chaitanya, which you know today. You can know and can feel it and can also get the experience. The same Omkar today in the form of chaitanya, is making you pure.

We worship Shri Ganesh in every puja, and today you have very nicely organized to worship Him only! But when we worship something, we have many different forms of desires. Some people are desirous: some ask for money, some ask for their work to be done properly, some say to have recognition, some ask for fame and to get honour, some ask for good jobs, some for business, some ask their house should be built. These are all desirous attitudes. So, people worship Ganesh for such things. Siddhi Vinayak  here was awakened by Me many years ago. People now go to the Siddhi Vinayak and ask for different things. But He is the Siddhi Vinayak. He is not giver of ‘things’. For that, there are many others sitting in this world doing miracles, who will give you diamonds, give you emeralds, and take away everything from you.

Omkar itself is formless; it has no shape. So to begin with, the form of Shri Ganesh was formless. Today we worship Him in a form, but Sahaja Yogis should know what the ultimate goal of our life is. What do we want? Have we accomplished that? Have we fulfilled our destiny? Why did we come to Sahaja Yoga? Did we come to get good health or get good business or get the honour or win in the election? Everyone asks for this; what is so special about it?

But Sahaja Yogis should think that today we have risen to a new level, we stand on a new height, so what are we expecting from this? And what is our wish? So now we have to come to this: the Ganesha whom you worship today in the form, you have to achieve Him in a formless manner. You have to attain Him within yourselves, He has to be settled within ourselves. It is not that you go to offer Him flowers; everyone does that. You offer Him flowers, His puja is offered, Mother’s puja is also offered; Gauri puja is also offered! But you can accumulate His power within you. You can manifest its result. You can purify your attention, your mind, your intellect, your speech, and you can also purify others. I made you like this Ganesh only. By making you self-realized the same way I made Ganesha. There's no difference. Exactly in the same way, made in the same way. But how high is Ganesha !

So, when you worship Ganesha, you should think that we have to rise towards the formless. One has to be one with the formless. We just run after the form only.

Recently, one Sahaja Yogi came to Pune from Borivali. He said to Me, “I missed Krishna Puja as I couldn’t come to Pune and I missed this puja too.” I asked, “Why did this get missed?” He said, “I bring Ganapati to my brother’s place and we have three days of festival, so I came here and my puja there is missed.” Means ignorance is still there. –  By missing the puja here, and you buy Ganapati for some 10-15 Rupees and go there. So it means, you can buy Ganapati! You can’t purchase Me, but you can purchase Ganapati! And on top of this, there are so many things are done here in the name of Ganapati. That is why it is raining in Pune these days, so that all the paths of Ganapati (procession) would be closed and it should rain until Ganapati is immersed (the statue immersed in the water). There would be no need for immersion as it is, He would be immersed by Himself in the rainwater!

The tales I heard about Ganapati festival there, I was completely speechless that they make Shri Ganapati sit there and they drink alcohol in front of Him. They sit there and drink alcohol; sing dirty songs; perform dirty dances in front of Him. And all dirty types of women stay there and do all kinds of (dirty) business. This becomes humiliation of Ganapati.

Lokmanya Tilak had suggested to make Ganapati festival as a social event where people would get a platform to organize a grand type music performances, or series of lectures or such programmes to bring awareness in the society. But the way it is organised now, it would turn a good person to bad. The bigger the statue of Ganapati, greater is the sin there! Doing sinful things in front of Ganapati, will He spare them? He will not spare these people. Till I am sitting here, it is going to be okay, but then these people won’t find a place to hide because He knows where the work is to be done and where the efforts are needed.

I am afraid what is going to happen. This place is called Punyapathanam (पुण्यपठणम) and already there is a demon sitting in this city of Pune.  Many more are assembled there. Besides, there are so many misconducts in the name of Ganapati, what to say to this? Because they are not connected to God Almighty. They do puja to Ganapati and request, “Ganapati, please be seated here! You are sitting (here) because we have purchased You and brought You here. So, You are in our hands now! (so we can do what we want with you)!”   So you are allowed do anything in front of Him because it is just made of clay and that you have bought Him, and (do ‘visarjan’ विसर्जन) immerse Him in water whenever we want. Man's arrogance has brought him down to such a level that he commits all kinds of sins in the name of God—in such a way that you are seeing that any temple you go to, there they make bhoots dance in the temples of the goddesses. It is done shamelessly. They don't know what calamity they would face.

Today we talk a lot about religions, but no one cares about the condition of religion. Now what is the use of bringing religion into the politics when the religion didn’t remain a religion at all? It is the same in every religion. If it is about one religion, one can say that: it is bad or that is bad. But every religion is moving in the same direction. So when you worship Ganapati, you should know that you are Sahaja Yogis. You are yogis. What the sages and great people did not get, you have got it easily today. Everyone's got it, brought you on the right way, got everything. But when I say something, you never look at yourself. You think that I am telling this to someone else. You do not think that we are one of them, and where is our vision? What do we think? “Mother, I am buying this house, and please bless it.” Well, if you are there, and you are blessed, then what more? Then: “Mother, please bless the key of my vehicle.” So they are standing with a key. I will give such a blessing that your vehicle will not run at all. And then, forcing Me, that: “You come to my house. If you do not come to my home then this will happen.” And then there, what we will hear is: “My business is like this, my this thing is like this, my that thing is like that.” These are not the characteristics of Sahaja Yogis.

Those who do Sahaja Yoga should remember that we have to enter into the formless. That is, you are not going to be formless; but you are fully going to become an instrument of the formless while being in the form. Radio is better than you. Say, when someone makes a radio with his own hands and connects it up, then music can be played on it. The radio doesn’t throw dust, does it? So first of all, we have to awaken Ganesha within us. Not just worshipping, but if we have to awaken it, then first of all we need to see if we are pure. There should be purity within us. So the first thing for purity is to pay more attention to our fundamental values.

Nowadays because of the cinema and other new things, even our eyes have been spoiled. And that innocence, that constant unconditional love has disappeared from this world. No one can even think that someone can love like this. And among all this, people think how to do so that both Sahaja Yoga and our (dirty) business can be managed side by side. Like yesterday, one lady came to Me and said, “My husband is madly in love with another lady.” I said, “Leave him.” “But no,” she said. Her husband says: “I am a very good Sahaja Yogi. I have got kaivalya (कैवल्य - ultimate realisation/liberation); my relation with Mother is a separate thing, and my relation with this lady is a separate thing.”

You cannot get into the boat by climbing over the crocodile. And those who are still engaged in such activities and these things, it is appropriate for them to leave Sahaja Yoga and free us. And to take a break from us. Whatever will happen to them, will happen, but Sahaja Yoga will be defamed for no fault of its own.   If your attention still gets entangled in such things, then it should be understood that you have not found the basics of Ganeshji. The very basics !

In Maharashtra, this is not appreciated – they don’t understand the tendency of men going behind women. This is considered to be some weird thing. Just get married to someone right here, and accept her as your wife: this is how it is. There is no madness of (running after) women here. But I have heard that it is a lot in South India, too. There was a king, and it is heard that he had twelve thousand wives. It is surprising! And among them, some used to walk, some used to go in palanquins, and some on horses and some on elephants. Then he had desire to get one more wife. So he tried to get a woman, and when he tried for her, she refused, saying, “I don't want to to be with you.” So he attacked her kingdom. At that time, a Muslim king ‘Tughalaq’ was there, who gave a befitting reply to that attack and this king was defeated and his twelve thousand wives also ran away. So he was destroyed because of one woman !

So, our Sahaja Yoginis should also understand how we should keep our energy fully alive within us. And how we should be very proud of our virginity, of our virgin state, of our Gauri state. Because this is the power of a woman. If this power of a woman is taken away, then such a woman is of no use. And that is why no one even respects such a woman and does not even accept her. However nowadays, we see in the world that the majority of people, the majority, – people believe in such women who are famous this way, must say, full of filth, in whom purity is not even touched. So these who are the majority, they are going on the same path towards their hell. The majority will go there, and I can see today only that what would be the condition of this majority. However, you are not a majority, you are a minority, and your situation is different.

So you should know that engaging in such kind of work does not suit you at all. And even now I see some people having their attention wandering here and there. This is the first thing we should know, that the morality we have, at least our morality should be right. Now the second thing, which is especially in Indians, which is lacking in foreign countries is morality. But the materialism is strong there. But they are not interested in material things. They do not find material things interesting. But the eyes of Indians can not rest until they read all advertisements in every shop. They will read every advertisement even by turning back their heads again and again, what is available here, what is available there, what to buy here, what to buy there. And also when they go abroad, they are in the mood of shopping! It is very shameful thing and also when they go to foreign countries from here after getting married, they become so materialistic people, that no one can understand, what their materialistic mentality is.

It is also seen in Ganpatipule  that people there are like, “see, we have got one thing but we have not got this other thing till now, so please give it too.” How frivolous it is! Everything should be at your feet / not important. Then as soon as you put your attention on the formless, all materiality becomes worthless. How can you be a Sahaja Yogi unless this honourable state comes within you?

Look at Tukaram, it is okay to stay according to the position you are in. Just as King Janak was. As he was a king, he used to live like a king. But he knew the worth of everything, he did not give importance to material things. And as long as you are bound by this materialism within, then your very first step cannot enter into the temple of Shri Ganesh. All right, this is Mother, She wants to give; because in this way I can show that I love you. But that doesn't mean it's a big thing for Me. Many times things / feelings can't be said with words; you don't understand My glance. Then through (giving) things only I want to show that I am with you and you are with Me. You are My children. But it doesn't mean that you stick to materialism like mad. And sometimes it is extreme, that even if you give something to someone, that person says, “Sir, I do not wear this thing, I do not want this thing, I want another thing, I wear like that.” You are really great!

We have such great people, who (Shri Ram) ate the berries tasted by  Shabari (a tribal woman) and who (Shri Krishna) dined with Vidur (son of maid)  . Such people are (examples) for all of us. They are not hidden from you. So it is cheapish to behave like this. If the Mother has given even a small thing (gift), consider it very high and keep it on the head. If you don’t come to this point, then all your fashion and all other things are useless.

Among all the qualities of Shri Ganesh, the main thing one has to do is to purify one’s attention. The method of purifying your attention is to watch where your attention is. If your attention is on God Almighty, it is pure because vibrations are flowing in you. What is the use of that attention if it is roaming here and there? Unless your attention is pure, you cannot attain the knowledge, because only in the attention all your vibrations are flowing. You know everything through attention only. The one who has a pure attention can work only by thinking about it. Work can be done only by paying attention, and sometimes even that is not needed. The power you want to attain, whatever you may call it as ultimate goal, you may you call it your aim, is this chaitanya, which you want to settle within yourself, which has this power. When you have this power, you can do many things. But neglecting that, why are you after these useless things?

If all your attention is indulged in how much money we can get by following Sahaja Yoga; otherwise,  what things we can get? If the attention rises a little higher, then it starts thinking how to cure our sickness. After that, if the attention rises more, then at the most it starts thinking how to get to see [darshan] Mother. Now people come from everywhere – sometimes from Aurangabad, sometimes from Sangamner – and from anywhere. People come and settle from Delhi, or from Calcutta. We came deliberately, muddamun (मुद्दामून) is a word in Marathi – there is no synonym for it – muddamun  (very very deliberately). Why did you come? I do not have time. Why did you come deliberately? Then you fight that we came to see Mother! You can see Me in the heart itself. You have been given such power; it’s more than enough to see to that power.

I am also that power [shakti] only, right? You have not got Me in formless; that is why you need to see Me. But you waste My time by sitting for hours and talking about all sorts of things. What is the need? In being the embodiment of power, you can become the power yourself. But when will these hindrances go away and when will we understand that we ourselves can become the embodiment of that power? And we have so many powers within us, we should be absorbed in them, due to which all the work gets done without doing anything! But this thought does not come into mind easily. Not only ignorance is there; if only ignorance, then I would say it is okay, there is ignorance. It is not only ignorance, but it is greed that is holding us, and another is, attachment -maya – this is my boy, this is my son, this is my daughter. And when you think like this, you should think that we are also sons of Mother, daughters of Mother, and now we are Her children only.

After coming to Sahaja Yoga, your life has changed. You have moved to another lineage, your home has changed, your gotra (usually each human is the descendent of some specific Rishi’s family) has changed, your caste has changed, your religion has changed, you have completely changed to a new person, new human. Why is it so? Because your Mother has given you the awakening. So all of you have completely changed. Like by establishing one Ganeshji (within us), our thousands, millions of works are done because He has complete faith in Mother and He is completely surrendered to Mother. So until that purity will not come in our heart, till we do not achieve that purity in our mind, that surrender will not come. It is like this: that unless you go to the Ganges and don't immerse the pitcher in it, and if there is no space inside the pitcher, how will it be filled with water? This is a simple logic.

So it is necessary that we purify our attention, and after purifying it, only that pure attention we can offer it to our Mother. Impure things will only hurt Me. And when attention is pure, then you are surprised to see that you become fragrant like a flower, and seeing you I also feel cheerful, that: Aha! That’s My son standing, that’s My daughter standing! All other things do not make Me happy; like you are standing with very nice clothes or a suit, or with haircut, or with lipstick, etc. That doesn't make Me happy at all. On the contrary, I feel that they are leaving now, now they are moving away from the path. To achieve this kind of modernisation is going away from Ganesha. What is the need? He is ancient, and I am also very ancient. So if you are My sons and daughters, then you have to follow and live with the culture we consider to be ancient.

And the picture looks very bad outside (India) - people themselves tell Me that. Those who are foreigners, for whom it is necessary (to dress properly) in their society, they tell Me if I give them permission, they would roam around wearing saris and, will roam around wearing kurtas and pyjamas. But here we have the opposite. So the culture of Ganesha, the culture of which the innermost abiding quality is beauty. Now you see that He is so fat, His belly is so big, He is huge, Ganesha looks so fat. But what is His beauty? What is that attraction (towards Him)?

Why did Lokmanya Tilak (freedom fighter) chose the idol of Ganesha? Actually, people in Maharashtra keep doing “Vitthal, Vitthal” from early morning till evening. Vitthal also left from there! Here all have this attraction towards ‘Vitthal' and all consume tobacco! But why did Lokmanya Tilak choose Shri Ganesha only, and why only Ganesha creates all the beauty in the whole creation? After all what is His unchanging characteristic, that without it, Shri Rama, Shri Krishna, Jesus Christ or Buddha, or any other person couldn’t have formed this beauty. What was that essence in Him? He has the childlike nature in Him; the nature of a child in which innocence is there, which is full of innocence– he is filled with complete innocence. This is the thing that is most attractive and beautiful! It is not your cleverness or your make-up; this is not attractive, it lasts only for few moments.  In front of you people will say good, behind they would speak ill. But the innocence which is essense of Shri Ganesha is the beauty of this creation, in the whole world.

The aesthetics of the world is the work of Shri Ganesh. His childlike behaviour, similar description of Shri Krishna, also, which is very pleasant. Surdas has described how He used to dance, how His anklets used to make melodious sound, how He used to fall, and surprisingly how He used to be very happy to see Himself in the mirror, whereas He is the doer of the world. How He made His mother see the whole world by opening His mouth and, He was behaving like a child! The same has been said about Shri Ram. People did not tell about the childhood of Jesus Christ, but you can know about His childhood in the form of Shri Ganesh. And that is why it is big mistake of people where they did not talk about the childhood, as such people do not have joy and happiness; weeping and sobbing became the (their) religion.

As you see that Jains religion, there is crying and weeping, Buddhists are of crying type, Muslims are also of crying type: so much so that only God can save them! And Christians, too, do a lot of crying and weeping. Jesus Christ crucified Himself on the for all and asked for forgiveness for all the sins of the people at once. Now you will be surprised that there is such a place where they cannot dramatize the crucifixion of Jesus,  so they hang someone else and take round that hanged person in a big procession. Tell Me, can you get Jesus Christ by doing such a spectacle?

So that joy, in order to get that joy, first of all you should become like Shri Ganesha. But who pays attention towards it? Even after this puja today, you will think that Mother told us that we should become innocent like Ganeshji, even if someone deceives you. Many people tell Me that, “Mother, You are very simple, You are very naive, people cheat you.” The one who can cheat Me is not yet born, but I am.. (inaudible)

Let me see what kind of swindler you are, otherwise how I will know what swindle is? Because I don't even know what is ‘swindling’! When they deceive Me, then I know that those are deceits and this is swindling. Then by putting attention there, the swindler finishes and cheating also ends. So it is necessary that man accepts the innocence. It is said also for Shankara (Shri Shiva), that He is naive, He has innocence. Which gods do not have innocence? It is said for the Goddess, that when She got furious and thought of destroying the whole creation – She was completely fed up – then there was an outcry in all the people, as the Mother got upset, what would happen to us now? And everyone felt that the world would collapse and will not be created again. At that time, Shankarji (Shri Shiva) got an idea, to put Her own child under Her feet, saying “if You want to start destroying it, then destroy this child”. And such a big tongue came out of Her mouth: “Oh my God!  I am destroying My own child!”

So, actually the children make us feel the love, joy, unity, and what we call concentration as well as integrity. Everyone has said that the world becomes one because of children. When a child is in trouble, all the parents have attention on that child to save the child. Because we are universal in a way. The biggest thing that is universal, that children should be allowed to flourish. It is a universal power and its awareness, its experience, is within all of us. That's why Jesus Christ has said that if you want to enter into the kingdom of God, then you should become like little children. This is the real worship of Ganesha, when you have that innocence.

And their actions like spontaneous dance, the effortless fight, and their spontaneous talk, how beautiful they are! Everywhere you get His Darshan and you see. But here you get attached. In children there is absolutely no attachment. They make everything like a game. You take them to the airport, they will find something as running, jumping, making a game of something. Everything is a play for them and they leave it immediately, too. They have no attachment. There is no falsehood with them, that: “this game is mine.” When this happens, then one should know that the child is no more that childlike. If you ask for something, a child would bring you three times. If playing a game, he would leave and run away, to play another game. He does not know if he should stick to it or be happy.

That innocence, in that innocence there is a deficiency of one thing that they have no knowledge, which is fulfilled in you; there is innocence without knowledge. But you have found the knowledge, and its crown is your innocence. Even after acquiring such a great knowledge, if we cannot achieve that thing, if we cannot get the reverence of Ganesha and His surrendering power, then it is useless to do everything else. In My opinion, this is like a machine in a way: you come, chant Ganesh mantras, and then do this. I think that in every puja, so many times we worship and say His mantra. It is okay to say His mantra, but I think worshipping Gauri will be good. She guides, She is Kundalini, She lifts you up.

You can see Ganesha only in His form. Right now, you are unable to see Him in the formless because till now you have not operated Kundalini (Gauri) and have not taken shelter under Her (Gauri). You want to see only Ganesha.

Today is the day of Gauri; it is such a coincidence that in Sahaja Yoga, puja is always done with convenience, not on muhurat (मुहूरत - the particular precise time to start any auspicious thing according to the astrology). It should be convenient: it should be Sunday, otherwise, not everyone can attend, and the time on Sunday should be such that there is no movie . Till today I have never seen any movie on Sunday and I do not know whether there is movie or not. But there is movie on Sundays, so it is good to do the puja in the morning: “Mother, you should finish soon because then it will be the movie time.” If this is our attitude, then what is the use of doing Ganesh Puja? If our attention is engaged in such things, then please understand that we cannot cure it. There is no cure for this.

So, you should keep watching your attention at all times what thoughts are arising in it. As Namdev has described, it should be like a small child holding the kite string in one hand and same time, he is talking, playing, laughing, joking—but his attention is completely towards the kite. Similarly, a yogi should keep his whole attention on the kite, towards your spirit. Otherwise, all these powers which are given to you cannot be fulfilled. There cannot be any development or eruption of it. Many people ask, “Mother, why does this happen?” As you know, any Sputnik-like things which are sent into the space, their mechanism is like this that they are put one inside the other, and when the first one reaches certain limit, it explodes and pushes the next one further. Then the second one explodes and the next one inside is pushed further, it accelerates its powers, it gets a boost immediately. Why doesn't such an explosion take place within us? Because still we are like Ganapati (statues) which can be bought for 10 paise. That is the reason.

If there is a real Ganapati, then it should explode and people should know that each and every person is so great! That doesn't happen. We indulge in our own things. (we are involved) In our own matters, we think about ourselves and all the time we think that: “What is our benefit in this by coming to Sahaja Yoga?” In fact, it is total gain, totally beneficial. Because the moment you sit on your throne, the whole kingdom is yours, but instead of sitting on the throne, you go to every door and beg, then you are only a beggar. What is the use of offering you to sit on the throne? And even after sitting on the throne you ask Mother if She can give a little more money, then what is the meaning of this thing?

If we want to awaken the power of Ganesha within ourselves, then first of all we should know that we should focus our attention towards the formless, towards Chaitanya, and see the chaitanya which is flowing from inside us. Those whose chaitanya is impure will say that “I have got a bhoot [evil].” How come? Ganesha can never get any bhoot.

I have given you a place in My body. No one would have done this. And I take the trouble for your cleansing. But why can't you people cleanse yourself? And people will come and say, “Mother, my Agnya has been caught, I have got ego.” Why did it happen? Why do you have ego when the doer is God Almighty? It is because we do not see our faults, put it in others and say that this is your work, and it is because of you. Shri Ganesh is opposite of this! If He comes to know that I do not have attention on Him, He puts everyone right. I'm telling you He is such an expert, smart, alert, skilled. He knows who is sitting where. And how (is that person)? I also know everything; not that I do not know. But I want to keep you safe – but not Him. He says: why let such useless people follow Mother? He himself would settle them.

But the biggest thing that I still don't understand is that after all this, your speech is not pure. Many people use abusive words, still in Sahaja Yoga. They scream, shout, speak loudly. There is no love or sweetness in it. It means even your speech is not pure. And on the top there is pompous show, one can say like showing off that we are smiling a lot, we are laughing a lot, we are feeling very happy, and from inside I can see that their hearts are not clean. That gravity of the real joy has totally different glow. And that cannot be hidden from Me. Whatever makeup you put on and come, I will know how deep you are in the water. But why is that needed? Why do I even test you? What is the reason that I test? Why do I work so hard? The reason is that I want all of you to shine. But as long as you do not have your own benevolence in your mind, until you do not pay attention to the fulfilment of your ultimate goal, you will be indulged in useless things and will continue to trouble Me with that; people argue with Me, “Mother, we worship you so much, how did it happen like this?” Why, don’t you have any flaws? Are you complete? Do you say that you have got your Self-Realization? When we think of such things, then our attention goes upwards, and our hands outstretch towards Chaitanya; at that time chaitanya starts flowing in us and it is so happy to find its place there. Just like a flood comes, the whole body gets illuminated.

It is a very easy thing to illuminate one or two people, but I want that we should become like this collectively. Because it is the need of today, otherwise just think [of] where this society is going. Fraudulent people are coming up. People are in trouble from all sorts, and apart from this, there is so much immorality which indicates the dark Kali Yug. What do you want your children to do in this? Or you want that you have come to this world for some special great work and you should do that work. All done; you had money problem that got solved, job problem was solved, and many other problems were solved; what next? The greed is not getting over yet. And for that, too, bothering Me all the time. Is not at all appropriate. Only questions related to Sahaja Yoga should be asked to Me, and asking any other question is wrong. And there is no need to talk a lot to know that question in the end. Asking calmly will automatically give you the answer. Otherwise you will have to install My loudspeaker every time: “What did the Mother say in this?” So what is the difference between you and others?

A gentleman came to Me, started saying that “God speaks to me.” I said, “How?” He said, “I have Gita, I open it, whichever page that opens, I consider God is saying whatever is written in it.” I said, “Very good.” The same situation looks with Me. Open the page: what did Mother say? Said like this. Now this. You have creative power within yourself, you have reflecting power within yourself. You have that power within you which can make the world shine. Then why do you want again and again that Mother says something on this matter? You yourself can answer the question. I have seen that I am the only one to answer. People only bring problems in front of Me; “There is such a problem in this,” “There is such a problem in that.” But (I) find no one saying, “No, there is a solution for this Mother, we shall do it, You don't worry.” We also need such people who can say that we shall do it, it is not a difficult task.

Every man should know that whatever we are saying today – materiality, objectified, or whatever is being said – as soon as energy is transmitted in it, that thing becomes something else. As this thing [mic] is useless [without power transmission]; as soon as the power is transmitted in it, you are listening to Me. Similarly, anything which we say that is useless, as soon as power is transmitted in it, it becomes amazing. You love your children. Well, infuse power into them and those children will become wonderful. It will happen. If you love your home, let's infuse power in it, it will become a temple. If there is any defect in your intellect or you bring many questions to your mind all the time, you infuse power in it, the answer to everything will come in front of you. What is the need to ask Me? Above all, Dnyaneshwaji, While reading his books I am surprised, he never saw Me in physical form, but he realised the power that had been given to him and in the form of that power he took things to such new heights.

If you are still satisfied with the physical form, then you cannot move forward. You have to achieve Me in the formless so that the creative powers within you increase. This is what we believe, as people say, Shri Ganesha as our Mahaguru. The reason is, by the transmission of His powers, we ourselves become gurus. How many times do we say that we are our own gurus, but I don't see how many people who can stand on their own feet and say, “Yes, Mother, this the thing, for which we have answers.” “Only we know its answer!” And when they start giving the answers, they are such answers that the whole world becomes silent in front of them! But those who actually give answers are so egoistic, so stupid and so low that I don't understand if they are Sahaja Yogis or where they are going.

People without devotion suffer losses, that is one thing. There are losses also, and they have to learn. They have to take many lessons; understand that. But even after that, after going through all, if you continue to study in schools all your life, how will you get a job? If you keep failing every year then you cannot get a job. Why should God Almighty make you His servant? Because you say, “Lord, make me your instrument.” See, He also thinks who should be made instrument! What is the need to make such “defective” people His instruments, who create disaster every time? His car just can't move like this. (He can’t make things work like this).

We have all the power within us to become His instrument, we have the awakening within us. No one knew about Him as us. No one has even written about Sahasrara; that too we know. The whole thing is like an open book in front of us. But that doesn't mean it is enough just to read a book or that you become powerful just by saying mantra. The permanent base of the mantra is purity ; and its “reach” : as is said that “where is the glance?” Until there is harmony between the two things (the base and the reach) – as if there is a kite in hand and its flight is upwards. Similarly, unless in your life, you see where is your flight! Many people say that, “Mother, when we will have God’s Realization?” Can I give such a guarantee in writing? And second time, went there and started backbiting to someone. A person who cannot even control simple anger, how will he do Sahaja Yoga? Krishna condemned the anger first of all. Said it is the worst. “Krodhadhavati sammoha” (क्रोधधवती सम्मोह): Anger is the worst thing. It brings hypnosis.

So to awaken the power of Ganesha within us, we should think that we have to be pure and in that purity we should take His beautiful form which is innocent form. No! Otherwise, they would say, “Okay, we are Ganesha. We take parasha (a battle-axe, one of the weapons of Shri Ganesha) in our hands and go around hitting.” You don't have that power. That parasha is not in your hand. The day that power comes in your hand, then the parasha will be given in your hand. Right now the one you are hitting is (actually)your own ghost is hitting you. You are the ghost, if you are screaming, shouting and getting angry, hitting others – it can never be Ganesh power. Because you )don't even know who you're yelling at. Why are you screaming? What are you doing? The person who is mad like this should leave Sahaja Yoga and go to lunatic asylum. His place is not here.

Today's speech has the (sharp) edge of that same parasha. You understand, it is My right, you do not have the right to go about using this parasha around the world. – Cut off your nose, cut off your ears. You can't cut anyone else. In Sahaja Yoga, the person who does this, the world spits on a such person; laughs at him, jokes about him, condemns him behind his back. And such people get away very quickly from Sahaja Yoga.

Your speech should be very beautiful and clean. Must be good, must be sweet. But there should not be deceit behind it. Like businessmen: “Brother, you are very good, please have paan (betel leaf), eat this and that, and empty your pocket before leaving!” From the heart, (whatever you say) it should be said from the heart. And when the thing is spoken from the heart, it is very beneficial because the heart absorbs everything. The same thing becomes eternal forever. The rest of the things are superficial, the thing of the intellect remains superficial. But whatever touches the heart, that which is heart-touching, it settles in the heart.  Always remember this thing, that though the place of Shri Ganesha is on the Mooladhara, but when He comes in your heart, then in the form of the spirit He becomes chaitanya [full of vibrations]. The spirit is Shri Ganesha, and when the same Shri Ganesha gives light through our heart, then He only is the chaitanya. There is no need to worry at all for the one who has placed Shri Ganesh in his heart. He is said to be immersed in niranand all the time. He doesn't know about any other thing neither does he care. And Riddhi-Siddhi, all are there at His feet. Without his knowledge or even thinking about it; all the work is done automatically. This experience is proven. I am not saying this like that. This experience is proven. You know it, you know about Me; why shouldn't it be about you? Right now, I am only walking behind you, becoming Riddhi-Siddhi for you, but everyone has their own time of reckoning. You should also not leave your destination and turn to the other side. Keep your eyes elevated on where you want to go and what you want to achieve. This had never happened till today, and if you forget what is happening then it is not My fault. And there is no need for Me to punish for this: Shri Ganesh is sitting there with a parsha.

So look towards yourself, match that seriousness within you, with that depth which is the power of Shri Ganesha. That depth of bliss, as deep as an ocean of joy. Just on seeing such a deep soul a person becomes elated, filled with joy. Then your vision only will work. My troubles will be greatly reduced. This state will have to come, and today you should worship with this one determination, that: we are going to bring this state. And today especially Gauri is worshipped, Kundalini is worshipped, who gives us power and drive, who gives that power to Ganesha, due to which He is ongoing. And now by coming into the form from the formless state and from the physical form of you people, it can bring you into the formless, that is the Gauri shakti.

So we are the worshippers of shakti, and who is not powerful, is weak. The person who does not worship his power and who does not awaken that power in himself and does not get engrossed in it, and does not give its light, for him it's pointless to call himself a Sahaja Yogi. This way many monkeys and donkeys can be found on which I should label Sahaja Yogi, Sahaja Yogi. Sahaja this, Sahaja that. (By doing that) Will they become that? So it's not a matter of labelling; it's about the inside. It is a matter of the innermost heart. It should be received from the heart, it should enter the heart. And whatever is there in the society, in the politics, in the external, external things, they should not be allowed to enter inside. “Because everybody does it, so we also do the same”.

This is Sahaja Yoga, you have your own personality in it. It's not that it's individuality; it's not individual, it's personality. It is our personality. We are Sahaja Yogis. Why should we do things because the the world does it? We're not going to do it. As long as you do not move forward with this courage, Sahaja Yoga cannot raise any mountain (do anything higher) here – maybe we are able to make some swamp or bog. Mother's intentions are many and I have done a lot of hard work, I have not lacked any hard work, but now I want you to pay attention here and keep yourself content. But it does not mean that you show you are very content by bringing a smile on the face. No. (We should) weigh (and check) the satisfaction within us. Are we really satisfied?

I hope you all will meditate completely and devote everything towards meditation. Then only the work will be done. And when these powers come within you, then you will be surprised, that: “Mother, we have become higher than all the mountains, greener than all the trees, we have become greater than this earth.” Like Tukaram said, that “I am small in appearance, but I am as big as the sky.” Unless this is happening within you, what is the use of coming into Sahaja Yoga? Please pay attention to today's talk and pay attention towards it. And with all your heart you do the puja to Shri Ganesh today praying “with the help of Gauri Maa and with Her power, may we enter in the state of formless where we would be completely in the joy and, that it flows everywhere in our beings in such a way that people in the World realise what wonders Sahaja Yoga has done!” Achieving this wonderful state to the fullest is called excellence.

That thing should come in you. You yourself should judge whether you have achieved excellence in Sahaja Yoga or not. And everyone can do it. It doesn't require anything to read, write, or anything or a book. Only pure desire is needed, which we should keep within ourselves. I hope you get it in the puja today. You go out with this great power, not without it. Whatever small thing comes in your mind, that it should be fine or that should be fine, leaving all of this behind, get the supreme superpower today. Everything is going to be fine automatically.
