Sahaja Yogini: This is the moment that we have all been waiting for, and before Shri Mataji blesses us with her talk, we want to officially greet Shri Mataji from the members of government here. So, Shri Mataji, the first message is from Governor Pataki. And Governor Pataki says, "Dear friend, it is a pleasure to send greetings to all and to welcome doctor Srivastava to Albany, the capital of the Empire State.
As [Unclear] our communities represent various cultures. New York State is a venue for events that bring people together for common [unclear] mankind and teach positive lessons of world peace and harmony. 13:00
Through our understanding of various cultures, a greater level of global cooperation and friendly accord among all people can be achieved. It is with a sense of appreciation for those who are co-building a better world, that many people come together for a such an event such as this.
Best wishes for a successful and meaningful gathering.
Ever truly yours,

Mayor Cranna: It certainly is a pleasure and an honour to be here. When I looked out, in this room before, I realized I had taken my bar exam here, I must admit I feel much more enlightened tonight. Whereas Shri Mataji was born in 1923 in Chindwara, India, and as the youth worked closely with Mahatma Gandhi in the India's struggle for independence, and whereas Shri Mataji founded the Belapur International Medical Research Center and Clinic in Bombay, India, whereas Sri Mataji formed the Theater of Eternal Values, whereas Shri Mataji created the Sahaja Yoga Charitable Shelter in Delhi, India to provide shelter and comfort to the homeless, and whereas Sri Mataji founded the Sahaja Yoga International. Now therefore, I, Kenneth G. Cranna, Mayor of the City of Hudson, do hereby recognize the innumerable contributions and efforts that Shri Mataji has made to countless people, and wish to extend my sincere appreciation for your continuing commitment towards world peace and to proclaim tomorrow, August 3rd, the year 2001 in the City of Hudson, Shri Mataji Day.
[Applause]

Lady: Shri Mataji, from Kevin Cahill, who is a member of the Assembly, and there is a citation which is the last one, and it is from John McEnany, and he is again is,
"Whereas it is fitting that the Assembly representatives who comprise the People's House of the Empire State recognize and acknowledge the good work of distinguished visitors to New York who contribute so much to the cause of peace and justice, and whereas individuals who give of their time and energies and serve the best interests of their fellow man are an asset beyond remuneration, and cannot be sufficiently extolled, and whereas Dr. Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi has given not only of her time and energies, but also shares her joy, deep spiritual insight and inspiration through a method of Self-realization she created over 30 years ago, known as Sahaja Yoga, and whereas her tireless work for humanity and her impact on the spiritual evolution of mankind has earned her global recognition as a celebrated author, as well as an honour of being twice nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, whereas Shri Mataji has been further distinguished as a guest speaker at the Women's Conference in Beijing, China in 1995, and has been declared Personality of the Year in 1986 by the Italian Government, and has received recognition from the United States Congress in both 1997 and the year 2000, and whereas this committed woman has selflessly dedicated herself to her spiritual mission, bringing self-realization to her followers, and has always given of herself unstintingly.
Now, therefore, be it resolved that as a duly elected member of the Assembly of the State of New York, on behalf of the speaker and the entire Assembly, I send greetings and pay tribute to Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi, as she promotes her message of health of mind, body, among the family of man, and the practitioners of Sahaja Yoga here, in the capital area of the great state of New York,
John J. McInerney".
[Applause]

Shri Mataji: I bow. All the seekers of truth. At the very outset, I thank the mayor of Albany and also the mayor of Hudson for recognizing the work of Sahaja Yoga. I think America is a country where all talents are recognized and are absorbed. It's a very unique country, I must say, where people understand the value of spirituality.

It's a very difficult thing to work about spirituality because it is such a hidden power within us that we don't know what we have, and if somebody wants to tell you about it, people start guessing whether it is true or not. As you see in this world, though we have progressed so many years, I used to always admire Abraham Lincoln very much, I find still so many of us are lost in the search of truth. Even those who take to drugs or take to wrong type of things are mostly seeking the truth about themselves. What is the solution of this calamity we are facing in the whole world of big fights and wars, all sorts of killings?

The reason is we do not know ourselves, what we are. First thing, is we have to know ourselves. When you know yourself, you'll understand which is the right path, which is the right way to go. There have been many great changes before, even in China, even in Japan, of course in India, also in your country. But perhaps it was difficult for them to convince that all of us can achieve that state of spirituality.

I'm not doing any new work as such, but it's only new in one way, that it gives you Self-realization. To all of you it gives you that knowledge about yourself, and such unity is expressed with that that you'll be amazed, we are having no problem of all these nonsensical things we do all over, of destruction, of hatred.

Within us is the Spirit, it is in our heart, the Spirit, the science. And it’s the reflection of God Almighty. We do not know what we are. That's why we do not know also how spiritually we are endowed. We are endowed with it. It is within us and it's very easy in these modern times to become spiritual. We have all kinds of intelligence, as you know. People talk of intelligence, IQs and then there is also emotional IQs. But spiritual IQs, people don't understand. That's only possible if you become the Spirit. Now for that the God Almighty who is our Creator has already made arrangements. It's not that I have to make any arrangement, or you have to do anything about it.

Within us in the triangular bone, as they must have told you, resides the power, when it is awakened, it passes through six centres and connects you to the Divine Power, the All-pervading Divine Power, which in the Koran called ‘Ruh’ and in Tao is called as Tao. All these religions have described about this Power that is around us and does all, all the work. Everything is created by it. It is looked after. It is absolutely a perfect system that is being created. But in our imperfection, we don't understand it. But when this power which is in the triangular bone rises, it pierces through six centres as they have been shown here. The seventh one is below, below the Kundalini, which guards and looks after and protects the Kundalini. That is our innocence. Not that you have to be innocent; even if you are not innocent, even if you have been a criminal, even you have had horrible diseases with you, still this Kundalini when she does this in her ascent, what she does is to enlighten all these centres of the parasympathetic. It enlightens and purifies those centres.
And once it pierces through the fontanel bone area, it is actualization of your baptism. It's a happening. Baptism is not a ritual, but it is a reality which should work out, and you can feel it on top of your head, the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost and also on your hands.

You'll be amazed even Mohammed Sahib has said that, "When your resurrection will come, that time your hands will speak out ". How can hands speak? It’s through the cool breeze that they receive on the fingertips. It's nothing mysterious. It's nothing difficult. But what one has to do is to understand that we are all capable of getting it, and we are all capable of enjoying that life which we call as ‘Sahaj’. ‘Sahaj’ means spontaneous. ‘Saha’ means with, ‘ja’ means born. It is born with you. This Kundalini is born with you and you have a fundamental right to become a Self-realised person.

As a result of that as I told you, it enlightens all the centres which are responsible for our physical, mental, emotional and spiritual being. And once it is awakened, physically you can be cured. It's true with Sahaja Yoga, cancer has been cured, it's a fact. And for that you don't have to pay. It's in your own, your own power which cures it. If you know how to raise this, you can cure yourself, then you can cure others also. If you know what’s wrong with your centres, and if you know how to correct them, you can do this to others.

As they say there are Sahaja Yogis in 92 countries. I didn't go to all these countries, I cannot go. But what has happened is that, those who got their Realization, those who understood it, went down there, have given Realization to many. A country like Benin, we have 20,000 Sahaja Yogis. Ivory Coast we have lots of Sahaja Yogis. And this is what has happened is that, they got it through some Sahaja Yogi who went there. So when you get it, you can give it to others. You can make out what's the matter of another person on your fingertips. It sounds very strange but it is so. On your fingertips, you will know what's wrong with the other person, what's wrong with you and if you know how to correct it, you can correct yourself. You can get rid of any diseases, anything that you want to. But firstly, what goes out of you are our six enemies.

The first enemy that we have is anger. Then we have this lust which is boundless, which has no limitations, and which can make you a person living in Hell with that. So the balance is trapped on that. Then we have jealousies.
