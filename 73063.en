Sahaja Yogini: This is the moment that we have all been waiting for, and before Shri Mataji blesses us with her talk, we want to officially greet Shri Mataji from the members of government here. So, Shri Mataji, the first message is from Governor Pataki. And Governor Pataki says, "Dear friend, it is a pleasure to send greetings to all and to welcome doctor Srivastava to Albany, the capital of the Empire State.
As [Unclear] our communities represent various cultures. New York State is a venue for events that bring people together for common [unclear] mankind and teach positive lessons of world peace and harmony. 13:00
Through our understanding of various cultures, a greater level of global cooperation and friendly accord among all people can be achieved. It is with a sense of appreciation for those who are co-building a better world, that many people come together for a such an event such as this.
Best wishes for a successful and meaningful gathering.
Ever truly yours,

We also have with us a mayor from the city of Hudson, Mayor Cranna, who has a presentation for you, Shri Mataji. Mayor Cranna.
[Applause]

Mayor Cranna: It certainly is a pleasure and an honour to be here. When I looked out, in this room before, I realized I had taken my bar exam here, I must admit I feel much more enlightened tonight. Whereas Shri Mataji was born in 1923 in Chindwara, India, and as the youth worked closely with Mahatma Gandhi in the India's struggle for independence, and whereas Shri Mataji founded the Belapur International Medical Research Center and Clinic in Bombay, India, whereas Sri Mataji formed the Theatre of Eternal Values, whereas Shri Mataji created the Sahaja Yoga Charitable Shelter in Delhi, India to provide shelter and comfort to the homeless, and whereas Sri Mataji founded the Sahaja Yoga International. Now therefore, I, Kenneth G. Cranna, Mayor of the City of Hudson, do hereby recognize the innumerable contributions and efforts that Shri Mataji has made to countless people, and wish to extend my sincere appreciation for your continuing commitment towards world peace and to proclaim tomorrow, August 3rd, the year 2001 in the City of Hudson, Shri Mataji Day.
[Applause]

Debbie: Shri Mataji, from Kevin Cahill, who is a member of the Assembly, and there is a citation which is the last one, and it is from John McEnany, and he is again is,
"Whereas it is fitting that the Assembly representatives who comprise the People's House of the Empire State recognize and acknowledge the good work of distinguished visitors to New York who contribute so much to the cause of peace and justice, and whereas individuals who give of their time and energies and serve the best interests of their fellow man are an asset beyond remuneration, and cannot be sufficiently extolled, and whereas Dr. Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi has given not only of her time and energies, but also shares her joy, deep spiritual insight and inspiration through a method of Self-realization she created over 30 years ago, known as Sahaja Yoga, and whereas her tireless work for humanity and her impact on the spiritual evolution of mankind has earned her global recognition as a celebrated author, as well as an honour of being twice nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, whereas Shri Mataji has been further distinguished as a guest speaker at the Women's Conference in Beijing, China in 1995, and has been declared Personality of the Year in 1986 by the Italian Government, and has received recognition from the United States Congress in both 1997 and the year 2000, and whereas this committed woman has selflessly dedicated herself to her spiritual mission, bringing self-realization to her followers, and has always given of herself unstintingly.
Now, therefore, be it resolved that as a duly elected member of the Assembly of the State of New York, on behalf of the speaker and the entire Assembly, I send greetings and pay tribute to Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi, as she promotes her message of health of mind, body, among the family of man, and the practitioners of Sahaja Yoga here, in the capital area of the great state of New York,
John J. McInerney".
[Applause]

Shri Mataji: I bow. All the seekers of truth. At the very outset, I thank the mayor of Albany and also the mayor of Hudson for recognizing the work of Sahaja Yoga. I think America is a country where all talents are recognized and are absorbed. It's a very unique country, I must say, where people understand the value of spirituality.

It's a very difficult thing to work about spirituality because it is such a hidden power within us that we don't know what we have, and if somebody wants to tell you about it, people start guessing whether it is true or not. As you see in this world, though we have progressed so many years, I used to always admire Abraham Lincoln very much, I find still so many of us are lost in the search of truth. Even those who take to drugs or take to wrong type of things are mostly seeking the truth about themselves. What is the solution of this calamity we are facing in the whole world of big fights and wars, all sorts of killings?

The reason is we do not know ourselves, what we are. First thing, is we have to know ourselves. When you know yourself, you'll understand which is the right path, which is the right way to go. There have been many great changes before, even in China, even in Japan, of course in India, also in your country. But perhaps it was difficult for them to convince that all of us can achieve that state of spirituality.

I'm not doing any new work as such, but it's only new in one way, that it gives you Self-realization. To all of you it gives you that knowledge about yourself, and such unity is expressed with that that you'll be amazed, we are having no problem of all these nonsensical things we do all over, of destruction, of hatred.

Within us is the Spirit, it is in our heart, the Spirit, the science. And it’s the reflection of God Almighty. We do not know what we are. That's why we do not know also how spiritually we are endowed. We are endowed with it. It is within us and it's very easy in these modern times to become spiritual. We have all kinds of intelligence, as you know. People talk of intelligence, IQs and then there is also emotional IQs. But spiritual IQs, people don't understand. That's only possible if you become the Spirit. Now for that the God Almighty who is our Creator has already made arrangements. It's not that I have to make any arrangement, or you have to do anything about it.

Within us in the triangular bone, as they must have told you, resides the power, when it is awakened, it passes through six centres and connects you to the Divine Power, the All-pervading Divine Power, which in the Koran called ‘Ruh’ and in Tao is called as Tao. All these religions have described about this Power that is around us and does all, all the work. Everything is created by it. It is looked after. It is absolutely a perfect system that is being created. But in our imperfection, we don't understand it. But when this power which is in the triangular bone rises, it pierces through six centres as they have been shown here. The seventh one is below, below the Kundalini, which guards and looks after and protects the Kundalini. That is our innocence. Not that you have to be innocent; even if you are not innocent, even if you have been a criminal, even you have had horrible diseases with you, still this Kundalini when she does this in her ascent, what she does is to enlighten all these centres of the parasympathetic. It enlightens and purifies those centres.
And once it pierces through the fontanel bone area, it is actualization of your baptism. It's a happening. Baptism is not a ritual, but it is a reality which should work out, and you can feel it on top of your head, the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost and also on your hands.

You'll be amazed even Mohammed Sahib has said that, "When your resurrection will come, that time your hands will speak out ". How can hands speak? It’s through the cool breeze that they receive on the fingertips. It's nothing mysterious. It's nothing difficult. But what one has to do is to understand that we are all capable of getting it, and we are all capable of enjoying that life which we call as ‘Sahaj’. ‘Sahaj’ means spontaneous. ‘Saha’ means with, ‘ja’ means born. It is born with you. This Kundalini is born with you and you have a fundamental right to become a Self-realised person.

As a result of that as I told you, it enlightens all the centres which are responsible for our physical, mental, emotional and spiritual being. And once it is awakened, physically you can be cured. It's true with Sahaja Yoga, cancer has been cured, it's a fact. And for that you don't have to pay. It's in your own, your own power which cures it. If you know how to raise this, you can cure yourself, then you can cure others also. If you know what’s wrong with your centres, and if you know how to correct them, you can do this to others.

As they say there are Sahaja Yogis in 92 countries. I didn't go to all these countries, I cannot go. But what has happened is that, those who got their Realization, those who understood it, went down there, have given Realization to many. A country like Benin, we have 20,000 Sahaja Yogis. Ivory Coast we have lots of Sahaja Yogis. And this is what has happened is that, they got it through some Sahaja Yogi who went there. So when you get it, you can give it to others. You can make out what's the matter of another person on your fingertips. It sounds very strange but it is so. On your fingertips, you will know what's wrong with the other person, what's wrong with you and if you know how to correct it, you can correct yourself. You can get rid of any diseases, anything that you want to. But firstly, what goes out of you are our six enemies.

The first enemy that we have is anger. Then we have this lust which is boundless, which has no limitations, and which can make you a person living in Hell with that. So the balance is trapped on that. Then we have jealousies. It's a very common thing which one will do. Jealousies are there; it’s so stupid, but it is the truth.
[Laughter]

Then we have also another enemy which we call as attachment to things. We are attached to our family, attached to ourselves also. And we waste so much energy on that. And when we find that it was a very, very wrong thing to deal or was very superficial, then you are very much caught up.
Then we have a possessive nature. We want to possess the house, we want to possess the wife, possess the children, all kinds of possessiveness which is stupid. What can you possess in this world but yourself? You have to possess your Self. You have to know your Self. And for that you don't have to do anything. You don't have to pay anything. It's a natural process of our evolution.

In the evolutionary process, we have not grown as much as we should have grown. There's something missing in it, and that evolutionary process can be easily manifested through the awakening of this Kundalini. I must say this is not an original idea of mine, because in our country, and in many other countries also, they knew about this. But they were born with that higher type of awareness, and they didn't know how to make others, how to bring this to the notice of others or to give it to them.
All kinds of problems we are facing for nothing at all, because we have got the pure knowledge, we have got the true knowledge. Unless and until we have that true knowledge, we just go on fighting on various nonsensical things, killing each other, destroying everything. But if it happens to you, then you immediately see the real enlightenment within you, and you'll understand what you are supposed to do about yourself and about others.

It's a very remarkable thing, I think ,that is happening now all over the world. And it is taking a serious boost in so many countries. Countries which are not even developed so much, countries which are over developed. Everywhere, I was surprised, there are so many seekers, so many seekers of truth, and they just won't listen.

Now what does it give you? First of all, it gives you a complete balance. You are not disturbed easily, you are a peaceful person, absolutely peaceful, enjoying your peace and emitting peace to others.
Then it gives you collective temperament. Then you start seeing that the whole world is your own. You become a global personality. Then you don't think like, "I belong to this place, I belong to that place". No. You all become, sort of, globally bound together. As we have in Sahaja Yoga now, you'll find people from all over the world, who are together. And the way they enjoy each other, is really very, very satisfying and very joyous.

Another greatest thing that you get is love and compassion. Love and compassion which acts, which works. For example, now there are people who are taking drugs in this country. They can be easily cured, easily. Overnight people have been cured from drugs, especially in India. And now they are living a very normal life. They were all intelligent people but lost in that drug.

I have suggested that we could have this center for drug eradication in Canajoharie. But people are afraid of drug addicts. They say that, "Drug addicts, we don't want to have among ourselves, because they’ll trouble us". But it's an overnight, I told you, overnight you can get rid of your drugs. So, I thought of another solution. That all these young boys who take drugs, you see, they are put in jail. All their lives, poor things, they are in jail and all their beautiful years of enjoyment are lost in jail. It's such a pitiable condition. So I said, "Why not we start Sahaja Yoga in jail?" In India, in three jails we have got. And one of the most famous, ‘Tihar jail’, we have got Sahaja Yoga and people have changed and transformed. They are wonderful people. Now we can have that also here, very easily, and we can save these young people from going through the tyranny of jail. If it is possible, I would also request, Mr. Mayor, both of you, that if you can give us a little permission. Of course, we don't charge any money, we don't ask for any help, nothing of the kind. It's absolute charity. We can work in the jail for people, even the criminal simple, even the worst possible murderers, they become nice. This is our experience after all. So, we can solve this problem quite a lot if the authorities allow us to work in the jail for no price or no money.

Now one may say, "How is it so simple? Why is it so easy and why we don't have to pay any money for it?" The reason is, it is a natural process. How much do we pay when we breathe? How much do we pay when we see people? How much do we pay when we can hear? It's a natural process of evolution. And with this new evolution, your awareness becomes collective, your awareness becomes endowed with special powers of which you are not proud. This is the power of love, and Divine love without any return of action. The only return they think is that they could cure somebody, they feel over-happy. And they think it's the most joyous thing they have done in life.

And then the relationship around them is so beautiful. I have never seen them quarrelling, fighting or doing anything that was violent, never. Always enjoying, always in a very great feeling of oneness with everybody else. We have in India in a place called Ganapatipule, seminars, people from all these countries are coming. I have never seen them fighting or quarrelling or putting up a pitch [unclear]. They all the time are one with each other and enjoy the goodness of each other. Because all of them, if they become good, what is the problem?

Thus, you see this new method of awakening of the Kundalini, which I should say, I have done only one thing, that I have found out a method how you can do it collectively. Formerly, you know, a guru would take only one person out of thousands, and may give the Realization. Also, that is the tradition was, that one guru will give, real guru, will give to only one person. But now it's not so. So, collectively you can give Realization to so many people. They may be seekers, may not be seekers. Maybe any kind, they all can get it because this Kundalini is there, in the triangular bone. Can you imagine the Greeks called it sacrum, meaning this sacred bone. Why did they call it? They called it, because it was Kundalini there, they knew. Greeks knew a lot about this, but it so happened unfortunately, that suddenly, the whole thing changed and they had some other kind of spiritual movement. So, the real spiritual movement is where you become the Spirit. And when you’ll become the Spirit, you will be amazed at yourself, what you have been missing is there.

In all the religions, the essence is this. Christ has said, "Know thyself". Nobody tries that, "Know thyself". Mohammed Sahib has said the same. Everybody has said the same thing to first, you know yourself. But the question was how? How are we to know? And in that questioning people got lost into different, different type and styles.

There's only one style and that is awakening of the Kundalini and then you will understand the beauty of all the religions, of all the religious leaders, the truth about them. Because thus you know the truth. And what is truth is that you are not this body, you are not this mind, you are not your emotions, but you are the Spirit. That is the truth. And once that which you know, you know about everything. The truth has to be accepted and has to be practiced. Now if I tell you that, "You can cure somebody". You'll never believe it, even if after Realization. You will never believe it that you can cure without any medicine, without things. But you can. Then you have to try. That takes time, you’d better try. When you try on people, you realize that, "Yes, yes, it happens, it works, it works". And when you see that working out, then you have faith in yourself and you start working it on somebody. And you are so full of love and so full of energy, that you want to do it, you want to do it whenever it is possible. Firstly, enjoy yourself, then you enjoy everybody else. And then you enjoy your work of spiritual awakening.This is what has to happen.

There should be the actualization of baptism. It's not just that somebody breaks water, puts on their head, and you’ve got baptised. You cannot. It has not happened. That's what we are not. So, what is gone wrong is here. But first, you should all get connected to the Divine Power. And once you are connected you should feel them on your fingertips. It's sometimes, one doesn't feel, doesn’t matter. Maybe there's some sickness, maybe some problems. But whatever it is, ultimately everybody gets it. Those who desire all, all get it.

But there could be some people who are- just don’t want or some sort of, get into, I can say enmity for nothing at all and they don't want to give up their enmity. So, they may not. But if you just desire, just desire, it works.

For example, every desire you have is not a pure desire. Otherwise, supposing, we want to have a car. So, when you get the car, then you are not satisfied. Then you want to have a house. When you get the house, you are not satisfied. You want to move from one desire to another desire all the time. Because whatever desire you have is not a pure desire. Now what is the pure desire? This Kundalini represents the pure desire. Pure desire is to become the Spirit. That is the pure desire. And then you start enjoying everything. Everything you see, you become just a witness, and you enjoy each and everything. You don't criticize, you don't say anything, but you see everything. Seeing is very difficult, because our mind is so strong and we start reacting. But if you could just see something without reaction, all the enjoyment of that seeing starts making you so very happy and so very joyous.

I am very happy I could come to Albany. Just by chance, we saw this land and we purchased it in one day and then came to Albany. I must say this first [unsure] has been decided by very good people, and also has very good vibrations. And the whole thing is so much endowed with the glory of whole nature, such beautiful nature. Even in America you can't find anywhere, extremely beautiful and peaceful. And there suddenly we get this land, which I think is such a blessing. With this land now, we think we can do a lot of work, lot of things, which is very energy-giving, untiring enjoyment.

I don't know how to tell you the whole thing, because I must have given hundreds of lectures, in hundreds of places. But one thing is, you should only desire to have your Self-realization, that's all. Whatever you may be, you may be Hindu, Christian, Muslim, anything, you may be American, you could be Indian, you could be anything, makes no difference. There's no difference at all. Everybody has this Kundalini. As a result of that, of course, as I told you, physically you can be cured, mentally you can be cured, emotionally you can be cured, it can be done. It's not difficult at all. But only thing, you must have pure desire to get your Self-realization and then to grow by giving others.

I don't have a very good accent, American accent.
[Laughter]
I have studied only English from the British who ruled us. So, I hope you have understood what I have said. But if you have any difficulty, you are welcome to write to Me and the people will look after you.
Thank you very much.
[Applause]

Now those who want to have the experience, it will take no time, no trouble, nothing, especially Americans are very good at it.
[Laughter]
They are open hearted and they think about the whole world problem somehow. So, I think it will work out. But those who do not want to have their Self-realization can leave the hall. That would be very kind of them. Nothing will happen, nobody will jump.
[Laughter]
Nothing to be afraid of. Wherever you are sitting, you will get your Realization.

[Realisation process starts]
You have to just put both your hands towards Me, like this.
Just like that.
All right, you can close your eyes.

Now you can see if there is a cool breeze coming towards your fingers, if you are feeling any cool breeze. This is the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost or what we call Param Chaitanya in Sanskrit language, or the Muslims call it as Ruh.

Don't doubt yourself, don't doubt anyone. No need to doubt at all because you are capable of getting it. Have self-confidence within yourself. You are all going to get it.

Now please put your right hand on top of your fontanel bone area which was a soft bone in your childhood. Please put your hand, you can put the right hand first and left hand towards Me.

Very hot it will come if you are still person who is thinking about some of your problems or something, then there will be hot air coming. But if you just don't think about it, just you can move your hand up and down, you can bend your head, better is.

Now put your right hand towards Me. And now see for yourself if there is a cool breeze or a hot breeze coming out, doesn't matter. If there is hot breeze coming that means you have to forgive. You must forgive. If you don't forgive then it won't work out.
Actually, whether we forgive or don't forgive we don't do anything at all. But when we don't forgive we torture ourselves. So, the best thing is you forgive everyone. Just forgive everyone and now move your hand.

Now again please put your left hand towards Me. And the right hand again on your fontanel bone area.
Bend your head please, and see for yourself if there is a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area and also on the fingertips.

Now you can open your eyes and please put both your hands towards Me. Like this. Some people feel it from down below like that [on the back of the hand]. So, please try to raise it, if that is the case. If it is not, let it be. Like that, in case there is something coming from now.

Now. Forgive, forgive. Very important. If you don't forgive, there is a centre here which stops. Just forgive. You have to just say, "I forgive everyone ". That's all. Just say, "I forgive", don't think about them. Just say, "I forgive everyone ". That's all. And it works.
Whatever you say is accepted.

Now those who have felt a hot or cool or hot breeze, raise your hands.
Oh! All of you, perhaps, look at that. This is the first time I have not asked you to take out your shoes, because that helps a lot. You take out your shoes,, but it has worked. In England, when I first told them, "Take out your shoes", they walked out, you see.
[Laughter]
So, I felt a little worried. But you have got it with the shoes on.
[Laughter]
First time.
[Applause]

I don't know if we have a centre in Albany or not. But in any case, start a centre in Albany. So many people have got it, their Realization. So it's your responsibility that you start some centre. But you can give your name to them and they will inform you. And this has to grow. The knowledge, this pure knowledge about yourself has to grow. And there are many areas which are still to be opened out to you, which you can work out. So, the best thing would be to have - go to the centres once a week, that's all, no question. And for a short time. Any guidance you need, they will give you. Luckily we have people here. Even in such a far-fetched place like Canajoharie, we have people who know about Sahaja Yoga. I don't know how it has penetrated into these areas. But it has. And so it's very helpful. Nobody will ask for any money or anything. Just the enjoyment of it.
Thank you very much.
[Applause]

Sahaja Yogini: Thank you Shri Mataji.
We wanted to let people know of the follow-up information. And the lady to my right, Debbie, will be hosting and taking care of these follow-up sessions. So would you like to?

Debbie: Hello. My name is Debbie [unclear] and we will be having follow-up meetings starting this Monday at 7 to 8.30. There will be eight consecutive follow-up sessions at the main branch of the Albany Public Library. There's an insert in everybody's booklet with this information. It's 161 Washington Avenue. I believe there's parking. If you have any questions about this, we have a number 533-2317 and a website that's also on your follow-up sheet that's in your booklet. And we'd be happy to answer any questions that you might have and we hope to see many of you at our follow-up programs. Thank you.
[Applause]

Shri Mataji: They want to sing one bhajan, it is a hymn, before you leave and if you clap with it, your hands will open out.

[Questions from the audience]
Sahaja Yogi: Now we hear that some people had questions. Maybe, here, a couple of them we can take now before Shri Mataji leaves. Anybody has questions to ask.
Seeker: [Unclear]
He says that, when they felt the cool breeze, on their fingertips or above heads, what have they realised [unsure]?

Shri Mataji: You see, you have got it now and unless and until you use it, you don’t know what you have got. So we have to use it. What you have got is the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost, as I said, it’s the Param Chaitanya. But you use it and make experiments with it. And then you will know what is it. And whatever is happening within yourself also you can notice especially, the inside of your eyes has opened up after this. And you will feel very joyous and happy. But first of all, you must know how to use it.

[Cut in the video]

Sahaja Yogi: He feels in the palms, but not the cool.
Shri Mataji: He should. Now, please forgive. Now will you forgive?
Seeker: I have a problem.
Shri Mataji: Forgive, let it go. You just say in your heart, "I forgive everyone". That's all.
Seeker: I forgive.
Shri Mataji: Yes.
It’s the greatest thing to forgive. That’s the easiest.

Sahaja Yogi: There is still hope for him.
Shri Mataji: Now, just see [unclear] his Left Vishudhi.
Better?
Seeker: The hands just get hotter.
Sahaja Yogi: May be it can happen. He still has the feeling that.
Shri Mataji: Did you smoke, sir?
Seeker: No, but I used to.
Sahaja Yogi: He used to.
Shri Mataji: That's why. Don’t you [unclear] on the throat.
[Unclear conversation; two Sahaja Yogis work on the Vishudhi of the seeker]

Sahaja Yogi: Shri Mataji, do you have any Indian tribes in Sahaja Yoga? Some member form Indian tribes have come [unsure]
Shri Mataji: So nice. [Two ladies come on the stage with a man and give something to Shri Mataji]
What is it?

Sahaja Yogi: The three members of the tribe of the Mohawk Indians, they have just given some herbs to Shri Mataji, which is some sort of sausage made tobacco, but this is a sacred herb. Which they believe that.
Shri Mataji: Very, very auspicious thing they use.
Sahaja Yogi: But they believe that they offer it to the one who is the creator.

[Cut in the video]

Shri Mataji: ...very much. And they had a special place, even near Los Angeles, where they were having a sage in that land. And they used to go and meditate and work. Very nice people, very nice. They came to see Me and they said, "Mother, why don't you do something for us? " "And what can I do? She said, the government has taken over this land of ours, and it sold it to South India. And if you can talk to the Indians, if they return our land to us. I asked the name. I said, "This community is very money-oriented, and they will never, never release that. I'm sorry to say, these are Indians, but that's a special community in India, who is just interested in money and money and money. So I'm sorry, I cannot promise you something, which is very difficult. But you write to the government, and the government is better. They might understand and they might do something about it".
So the sage, the same sage, you know, he is a saint. Sage is a saint. And this one was very much respected even in China, even in Japan. So, it's a very right thing, very crucial thing that this is a special kind of a very auspicious, very holy, you can call it, holy for the saints, it's very important. And I am happy that they are still keeping the tradition.
[Applause]

Sahaja Yogi: But this is the beginning of a journey for you. Because over the weeks to come, you can deepen this experience, really go much deeper into this experience of thoughtlessness, of peace, become more balanced in your inner being and really achieve all the benefits of Sahaja Yoga that Shri Mataji discussed and that Andrei discussed earlier. But in order to achieve these benefits, it's very important to come for these follow-up programs. Sahaja Yoga meditation is a collective experience. It's something that you all go deeper in together. So, when many people are together, as we are here together this evening meditating, you'll have a much deeper experience.
So, do come for these follow-up programs, you'll learn the techniques and the knowledge of Sahaja Yoga, you'll learn how to have your daily meditation, and you'll learn how to have the full benefits of this singular experience of the Self-realization you had this evening.
Now in the room here tonight, there are a number of people who have these name tags. These are all people who are established in Sahaja Yoga and who have been practicing Sahaja Yoga for many years. If you have any questions, or if you'd like for someone to work with you a little bit, see if you can feel this, make sure you're feeling the cool breeze, that you have this experience of your self-realization, please feel free to go up to any of the people who are wearing these name tags in the crowd here and to ask them any questions you may have or to explain a little bit more about the meditation. So you really have the full benefit of everything that you've done here this evening.
Thank you very much.
[End of talk]
