It’s extremely dynamic and also deep, extremely deep. So in our Country, all the saints, they have the atmosphere of the Country and all the bad things of the Country and all the cruel things. In ancient time in India we had a system by which anybody who is a seeker of God was called a brahmin, so, all of us are Brahims now, absolutely confirmed brahmins. Then, an other caste was there, people according to the aptitude, like as you say “Ya Devi, sarva butheshu jaati rupena samsita”, so there you have to have the aptitude, “jaati”, whatever is your “jaat” means your aptitude, and according to your aptitude and your attractions towards achieving what you want they have made caste system. But later on it became a cruel thing, as it became in everything, extremely cruel, I don’t know what world to use it, stupid, and artificial. So they started the caste system according to birth, which is absolutely wrong, and they started treating some people as lower caste. So one of them is a caste called “Maaratha”, which is very hard working, beautiful area of human beings, but they started calling them “Maaratha” and putting them down. So because saints don’t like all this nonsense and this cruelty, and this kind of separation of good people, so then he sing a song about what can I tell you about God. How can I tell you how God supersedes people, how He puts people right, how He surpasses them, He himself has taken birth as “Maaratha” as the cast which is the lowest. So this is how God has beaten everyone by becoming a caste that is downtalked, so very beautifully put, did you follow the thing? No. Because you don’t have that system here. But somebody is regarding, here of course, you treat ill some people, say for example that you will treat ill some people who are from the black Country, supposing. So now, in that way, in our Country also, we have a caste, nonsensical system, absolutely horrible, so superficial and nasty. So God himself has taken birth now as of that downtalked caste to beat all the stupid human beings. So now do you follow that? All right, thank you. So this is what it is. And that is how He showed the superiority of those people who are unnecessarily as downtalked which is a very harmful thing to any society to cut down some part as useless, or (good) for nothing at all because they are born in a certain family. Like here you have bureaucracy, bureaucracy not so much, but you have, what do you call them?  Aristocracy, I mean they could be the worst possible people, horrible, immorale, absolutely. But they are aristocracy so they think no end of themselves, which is so stupid. So he says that the God Himself has taken (the form as a Maaratha) because He thought this is the purest form of a human being, so took the form as that caste which is downtalked. The form of that, alright, incarnated as that. It’s just only took around like this, so beautiful. May God bless you.
