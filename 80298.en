Let us now open up ourselves to get it. And if it doesn't happen, it's all right, next time I will do it. I'm willing to work hard. You know I work very hard, these boys can tell you day and night, and I've worked hard, very hard, and many have got it in this country. And I'm so happy I'm in London because I find in London people are really very much balanced. There's some sort of a force which I know already is there, which has worked, that people are balanced. There's some sort of a limiting force which makes them understand that they have to be in the center. And so many of them I've met here are really very beautiful people. But outwardly you can only see the shine on their face, a glow on their face. But inside they can feel your vibrations and they will know what's the matter with you. They will immediately find out what's the problem with you. So please, those who think they have already sought and found out are at liberty to go away. I'm not here to give you lectures or give you some mental feats and to give you a brainwash. You have to get your realization otherwise I have nothing to do with you. That's what I'm here for. Luckily my husband got elected and he had to come to London and that's how I'm here. Because the other day somebody said, people say that if she saw why did she come to London, now my husband is posted here and he too got elected by ninety-three countries and I had to come here. It was not because I came here to earn any living for myself. So this doubt also that some people are having in their minds should get it out. I came here because you wanted it, because there was a force which worked it out. That's why I'm here at your disposal and at yourself. May God bless you all. Again and again I bless you with all my heart that God should give you wisdom to choose the path of reality and work in His kingdom to be in His pattern and to be in His whole organization, to give up our value structure and to accept His value structure.
