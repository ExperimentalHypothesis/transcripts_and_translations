I bow to all the seekers of Truth.
At the very outset we have to know that Truth is what it is.
We cannot conceptualise it.
We cannot change it, we cannot transform it.
We have to feel the Truth.
At this human level, we do not know the absolute Truth.
That’s why there are all kinds of different opinions about everything.
Absolute Truth is for everyone the same.
So, what is the absolute Truth?
The first is that you are not this body, this mind, these conditionings, this ego, but you are the pure Spirit..
Then another Truth is that there is an all-pervading power... of Divine Love ...
which does all the living work.
We have these beautiful flowers we see there all around.
It’s a miracle the way from little seeds how they have come out in different colours in their own personalities.
We take it for granted.
Who runs our hearts?
Doctors will say it is our autonomous nervous system..
But who is this auto?
Who does all this job?
We should at least put our attention as to how these things are happening in this world.
There are no answers given in the science.
It cannot give.
Because science deals with dead things.
It has nothing to do with the living work.
Also it is amoral, it has no morality behind it.
Some of the calamities that have come to us are by science only.
That is to keep your mind open to what I am saying.
In case it is proved, then you have to accept as honest people.
Then you will be amazed that all divine laws are more tangible than sciences..
They are absolute and eternal in nature.
But we have not yet felt that divine power.
This all-pervading divine power is called by various names..
Some call it as the divine love, some call it as ruh and some call it as param chaitanya .
So before being connected to It, whatever we think is only mental.
And whatever we try to solve the problems are on a mental level.
And every mind thinks differently.
They do not think absolutely.
And that’s why we are astray.
When we think that science is not going to give us any answer;s, we turn to religion.
All these great prophets and great incarnations were born on the same tree of life.
On the same tree of Spirituality.
But people plucked it.
And said this is my flower, this is my flower and they are fighting with dead flowers.
This is why we cannot find answers and we do not find that understanding about the Divine.
But we have to know that God Almighty who has created us, will not leave us to our stupid ideas.
He will not allow us to destroy ourselves, how can it be ?.
He has created us with such great difficulties, with such delicacy, how can He completely allow us to have free hand to destroy ourselves ?.
He is a great Creator and a great Planner.
So now I am going to tell you about the subtle system that is within ourselves.
This system was know to all these great prophets, to all these great incarnations.
But they had no chance to talk about it.
They did not have people around them to whom they could talk.
They were not so subtle.
In that short time that they lived, under their struggle, they have put ideas of how to keep a balance.
But it has not been properly understood by human beings.
Now the time has come, this is a special time which is the time of resurrection, this is the kiama.
It is the special time of Last Judgement.
Where you have to judge yourself.
Even Christ did not have so many people who asked that what is the Truth ? .
Mohamed Saheb never had so many people to support him.
Their lives were full of struggle and that’s how the whole exposition of their inner being was not given.
This exposition I am going to give you today wase known to Indians thousand of years back.
They have described even Mohamed Saheb as Mahameda.
It means the greatest enlightened soul, amaster.
So to understand all these things, one should not think that it is coming from the East this knowledge.
In the eyes of God, there is nothing like East and West, it is just the same.
Only we human beings think this is Eastern, this is Western.
The Western civilisation has grown so big, like a big tree.
The tree which is not connected with roots cannot prosper.
And even if it prospers, it cannot exist for long.
So this is the knowledge of the roots.
Within us lies this beautiful power.
It is the power of our ascent.
In the triangular bone known as Sacrum,.
That means that the Greeks knew that this bone is sacred.
You can see with you naked eyes when it starts pulsating like a heart, this bone and this Kundalini, this power rises and pierces through your fontanelle bone area.
It is the actualisation of baptism, it is not some priest puts his hand on your head but it is the actualisation of your baptism.
That means you get connected with this All-pervading power.
Like this instrument, if it is not connected to the mains it has no meaning,.
human beings have no meaning because they are not connected to the mains.
Once you are connected to the mains, you see the light.
and the darkness disappears.
As a result of this happening, your Spirit starts manifesting.
You start feeling this all-pervading power on your fingertips.
And that these are, as you konw in medical science, are our sympathetic endings.
So you start feeling this on your fingertips and they become enlightened.
In the Coran it is clearly said that at the time of your resurrection (kiama) your hands will speak and will give witness against you.
For example if this finger is burning, that means you have got too much of ego in your head.
Or if this finger is burning on this side, that means something wrong with your heart.
That is how you learn from these 5, 6 and 7 centres on your fingers, on your hands, what’s wrong with you.
Everyone knows the same thing.
Because it is absolute.
So what is there to quarrel, or what is there to argue?.
So all these centres are for your physical, mental, emotional and spiritual wellbeing.
All world problems are mostly because of human beings, you have to admit.
And most of the human problems are because of these centres.
Take any incurable disease, cancer, aids, all kinds of diseases can be cured by awakening this power within us.
Today some sahaja yogi came from Australia and told me that one fellow is cured from aids, for the last 8 years he never had aids.
This is on the physical side.
Also on the mental side where people are crazy, they are suffering from schizophrenia; you see what is happening now in America, 65% person may get schizophrenic.
All these problems can be cured, if this power could connect you to the mains.
Now the emotional problems we have, we have also problems of habits.
There are so many destructive habits we take to.
We always take to something destructive.
I have seen people who are dying of taking too much of drug or alcohol, but others who see them die want to do the same.
All the affluent countries specially like Switzerland then all the Scandinavian countries, the young people are competing among themselves who is going to commit more suicides.
That means there is no happiness, there is no joy.
All the value system is absolutely finished.
This frustration comes into people who wants to know what is the reason.
They are the seekers of Truth.
William Blake, a great poet from England has described them that men of God will take birth at this time and they will find the Divine, and also they will make others divine.
These were great seers who saw this clearly this will be the future of the world.
Of the people who are seeking the Truth.
Of course it is not meant for stupid people.
Also it is not meant for the frivolous.
But it is meant for people who want to know the answer of what is happening to the whole world and why we are in a mess.
Now the nature of the Spirit we have to know.
The nature of the Spirit is that it is the source of absolute Knowledge.
There is so much knowledge within ourselves, we only know like the tip of an iceberg.
This knowledge starts revealing itself and letting us know what is the Truth.
The same thing is with the attention.
Such a person who gets his connexion with the Divine and the light of the Spirit shines on his attention, he becomes, his attention becomes extremely active.
The attention itself becomes divine.
Sitting down here you can feel the vibrations of any person.
Whether dead or alive.
If you know how to correct these problems, your own and others, then all the problems of the world can be corrected.
There is only one God who is reflected in our heart.
Which is the Spirit.
And when the Spirit is enlightened, we jump into a new awareness.
Because the Spirit is the collective being .
We jump into a new awareness where we become collective.
Not that we can feel our centres, but we can feel the centres of all the rest of the people in collective consciousness.
Also you develop powers to raise this Kundalini of other people.
Suddenly you develop a new type of a culture, we call it a sahaj culture, it means a spontaneous culture.
You don’t have to tell them don’t do this, don’t do that, they just don’t do it.
And a new race in a new age is coming up.
They have no physical problem, they have no mental problem, they have no emotional problem.
And such friendship, such love, such understanding.
Sahaja Yoga is working in 55 nations.
When I see these people I am amazed that there is no quarrel, there is no fight, there’s no argument.
They are all in the ocean of love and joy.
There is no State, there is no Government .
I don’t even have a secretary, you’ll be surprised.
I don’t even have a typewriter.
With very little money and no effort at all.
It is so spontaneous.
Because all of them realise how important it is today.
To get into this collective consciousness.
The second thing that happens to you is very remarkable.
You are all listening to me just now, but if I say that you get into the present moment, you cannot.
We either live in the future or in the past.
We are jumping all the time, our attention on the thoughts of future or past, all the time the thoughts coming to us.
In between these two thoughts, there is a little space.
Which is the present.
There is no thought there.
So the first thing that happens to you is that you come to a state, higher state of thoughtless awareness.
That is the state of Peace.
We may talk of peace, you know I have known people who talk of peace, have organisations of peace, awards of peace.
But no peace within, they are so hot tempered you know.
You have to go near them with a barge pole, anytime they might jump on you.
And they talk of peace!
Peace is within ourselves.
And when this peace is established, you reach a state from where you see everything like a drama.
You have seen a wheel which is moving and the axis is steady.
Our attention normally is on the wheel.
And we get disturbed.
But supposing our attention goes onto the axis, we are steady.
Or as we can see like this when the waves of these thoughts are there and we are getting actions and reactions, we are disturbed.
We are afraid that we may drown by these waves.
But if by chance if you can jump on a boat you can see all these waves and enjoy them.
But supposing you learn swimming.
You can jump in and save many of them.
This is the state that Christ has said that you are to be born again.
But it is not a certificate I am born again, you see just taking a self-opiniated certificate I am born again .
But what powers have you got?
You are just born again, you are this, you are that, but nothing in you, you are just the same like any other human being.
This is what is a nobi or a wali as called in the Koran.
So you will all have to become wali and the time has come.
In sanskrit it is called as vijaha .
And a bird is also called a vijaha .
Because the bird is first an egg, and then it becomes a bird.
In the same way human beings are in the egg shell.
They have to mature, and then the shell breaks and they are born again as free birds.
But this freedom is blessed with wisdom.
With compassion.
With love for everyone.
It is so much different from every day to day life.
See for example, you see a problem, you get disturbed, but you cannot solve it.
But once you get out of it, then you know how to solve the problem.
But the greatest blessing of the Spirit is that you enter into the ocean of joy.
Joy is absolute.
It is not like this happiness or unhappiness.
Joy is a state which is to be experienced.
Then you transcend all these races, all this fundamentalism, everything and you are one with that all-pervading power of divine love.
So you will be surprised that in Sahaja Yoga we have Jews who worship Mohamed Saheb, … Worship !.
And vice versa.
Everybody worships all these great prophets and great Scriptures.
Because they understand the unity between them.
They don’t have to read, they just know it is so.
You can ask on your fingertips.
I said Mohamed Saheb never said that He was a divine person.
I also said the same thing for quite some time.
Because if you say you are divine, everybody will jump on you.
But He was sent by God, He was definitely divine and a Master.
Master of Divine.
But the societies at the times are so horrifying that you cannot tell the Truth to them.
So they had to use analogies, paraboles, you see, in a subtler way they told them.
But I am going to tell you everything frankly.
In these modern times, nobody can crucify me or give me poison, thank God !.
And they were all people of a very different realm.
Christ has said those who are not against Me, are with Me .
He has predicted about Mohamed Saheb, that I will send Him, He will be coming on this Earth, He predicted in the Bible.
But nobody wants to see this point.
Everybody thinks they are the chosen ones.
It is a very sad affair, but thank God to these modern times.
The situation on human levels is so expugnating, is so much telling upon us, the tensions are so much that they have to find out the solutions.
And the solution is your Self, your self knowledge, your Spirit.
The Self which is the collective being within you.
And when you know that, not as a knowledge of the brain, but on your fingertips.
On your central nervous system.
Part and parcel of your being.
That you become one with that akhbar, that virata, as in sanskrit It is called.
And then you realise what you are.
Then you are fantastic.
You are glorious.
You are very powerful.
You are tremendous.
All these things, when you know, you are amazed, but above all, you are humble.
You are humble now.
Islam, Islam… is to surrender.
You surrender, you surrender, really you surrender, it’s not just lip service or outside.
Because you can feel the reality now.
All hypocrisy, all nonsense drop out.
This is the state everybody has to enjoy.
Sahaja : saha means with ja means one, born with you is .
So you have got the right, born with you is the right to get this yoga, union with the Divine.
So all of you have got this right, this birth right to get this divine ascent and this connection, yoga, with the Divine.
Do not condemn yourself.
You don’t have to suffer also it is a wrong idea.
God, the Almighty, is the Father of all the fathers.
Why will He make you suffer when you are seeking God ?.
If you are seeking God, really, you don’t have to suffer, that’s wrong.
He is just waiting for you.
He is the Father, who is nothing but love.
So please, don’t suffer; if you have to suffer, suffer for something else, but not for God.
Which father would like his child to suffer?.
It illogical.
It just happens to you because you are just there, it is all built-in within you.
You take a seed, put it in the Mother Earth, and it sprouts by itself. Sahaj.
How it happens ?.
Because the Mother Earth has got the capacity, built-in, to sprout and the seed also has got it.
So you too have this capacity.
I know there are so much of falsehood, so many people came from India, also they came out of jail and came here, became great… I don’t know what to call them… False gurus.
The other day I saw some young people saying some mantras, chanting some mantras.
By chanting like this, am I going to get connected with God?.
If your telephone is not connected, what is the use of using the telephone?.
You have to get connected!.
All other things are mental problems.
You cannot solve them mentally, because everybody has very big big brains, they go like this, you see.
It is the light of the Spirit, which will solve all of our problems.
And we will bring credit, we’ll fulfil the messages of these great incarnations and prophets.
Otherwise people doubt if they were really true.
They were, no doubt.
But for blind people, what’s the use of telling about colours?.
Nowadays I find people are much more open, much more alert, much more asking and it is working out in thousands.
Surprisingly in democratic countries it does not work out that well.
But in communist countries, it does,
wherever there has been, the communism finished.
Maybe we don’t understand Freedom.
And once they get the freedom, they jumped onto their spiritual ascent.
Of course, communism was never pure communism, neither democracy is pure democracy.
Everywhere some cunning people manage the rest of them.
But I hope people from Paris, as they are today here so many, will understand that it is very important that you are born at a very important time.
And if you do not understand the value of your own life, which is very important also.
You will be a person who will be supporting the destruction of this world.
If you really want to save it, and if you want to be part and parcel of that, just get your Self-realisation.
Of course, you cannot pay for it, it is a living process.
You can never pay for it.
You can pay for the hall, you can pay for electricity.
But not for your Self-realisation.
So please understand how important you are.
And take this opportunity to get your Self-realisation.
I know you have questions also in your minds.
I have been working like this for the last, I think, 22 years and I am quite an expert, I can answer all your questions nicely.
I become very clever.
And I know all the questions.
But it is a mental acrobat.
No use doing all that.
See there are beautiful lights here all over, see so many of them.
Just to get he light, you have to just switch on.
One switch and everything comes up.
But if I go on telling you about the history of electricity, how it came to Paris, how it came into this place, you’d be tired and bored.
So best thing is to have your lights.
It is already built in.
It looks very fantastic.
But I say you are fantastic.
You don’t know what you are.
You have to know yourself.
That is what Christ has said: know thyself .
Many a time He said know thyself .
But this part, nobody bothers to say.
Because now the religions have become money oriented and power oriented.
They are not spiritually oriented.
They dont talk of Spirit.
But it is your luck, your chance, I should say your great good deeds that your are born into these special time.
And I hope all of you will make full use of this power.
May God bless you.
Now, please put your feet apart from each other.
Your hand on your left lap.
Sit comfortably, and put your right hand on your heart.
Here now, you have to… please close your eyes, please close your eyes, don’t open them.
Till I tell you, please don’t open them.
Here you have to ask me a very fundamental question about yourself three times.
You may call Me Shri Mataji or you can call Me Mother.
Ask the first question 3 times: Mother, am I the Spirit? .
I have told you, if you become the Spirit, you become your Master.
So now please bring you right hand on the upper portion of your abdomen, on the left handside.
Here you have to ask another fundamental question 3 times: Mother, am I my own Master? .
I have already told you that I respect your freedom.
And I cannot force Divine knowledge on you.
You have to ask for pure knowledge.
So now please take you right hand to the lower portion of your abdomen, on the left hanside.
Here you have to say 6 times, because this center has got 6 petals, 6 times you have to say: Mother, please, give me pure knowledge .
As soon as you ask for pure knowledge, the Kundalini starts rising, you may not feel it at all .
So now we have to nourish our upper centres with our self confidence.
So now, please rise your right hand to the upper portion of your abdomen on your left handside .
Here you have to say with your full self-confidence 10 times: Mother, I am my own Master .
I have already told you that you are not this body, this mind, these conditionings, this ego, but you are the pure Spirit.
So now please raise you right hand on you heart again.
And here you have to say again with full self confidence, full self confidence that: Mother, I am the pure Spirit, say it 12 times.
This Divine power of Love is the Ocean of Knowledge and Compassion.
But above all, it is the Ocean of Forgiveness.
And whatever mistakes you have committed, they are completely dissolved by this Ocean of Forgiveness.
So, first forgive yourself.
Now raise your right hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder and turn your head to your right.
Here again with full confidence, you have to say 16 times.
Mother, I am not guilty at all .
I have told you, logically whether you forgive or you don’t forgive, you don’t do anything.
But if you don’t forgive, then you play into wrong hands.
Thus you have tortured yourself.
Now, at this special moment, please forgive all of them, in general, from you heart, not how many times.
Please say: Mother, I forgive all of them in general .
Say it from your heart.
Not how many times.
Now, just for your satisfaction.
Not counting your mistakes, or your guilt.
Not feeling guilty at all.
You have to ask forgiveness for your own satisfaction.
So now, please take your right hand on the back side of your head, and push back your head.
Now, here you have to say, again from the heart, not how many times.
O, Divine power, if I have done any mistake, knowingly or unknowingly, please forgive me .
Now the last centre is important, very important and you have to stretch your palm fully, and put the centre of your palm on top of your fontanelle bone area, and put down your head.
Push back your fingers, please.
Now, I cannot force self-realisation on you, you have to ask for it.
So please push back your fingers, put down you head and move your scalp with pressure, saying 7 times: Mother, please give me Self-realisation .
Please take down your hand… Please open your eyes.
Now put both your hands like this towards me.
Watch me without thinking, you can do it.
Now, put your right hand towards me like this, and put your head down and see for yourself if there is a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your head.
Don’t put the hand on top of your head, a little away, some people get it very far off.
We would like to present a Qawali to you in honour of, we have got a great personality, in his honour we want to present a Qawali. It says that God is limitless. And you don’t put Him in the limits. It is a beautiful Qawali they will sing to you.
