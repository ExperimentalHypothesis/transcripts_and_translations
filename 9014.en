Interview

Interviewer: Right we're going to talk about a kind of yoga, Sahaja Yoga if I've pronounced it correctly. And we're going to talk to a lady called Shri Mataji. Hope I've got that right too. Sahaja Yoga is now a recognised religion and it's catching on at a great rate here in Australia. In fact, the religion has just been granted permission to open a school here in Victoria and that school is situated at Kew. It's been established to comply with the extremely high moral and educational standards set by Shri Mataji. The basic objective of this school is to instil non-aggression peace and harmony here. Here, I think we all agree with that. Shri Mataji is in Australia for a whistle-stop tour and She's a brief visit us here in Mulba (?) Studio. And we'll have to put those headphones on because I forgot it's got the microphone attached to it. So, if you don't put those on, we won't be able to hear you. So, if you just hold that up there and speak into it, I think we would be able to hear you okay. Welcome to Australia first of all.

Shri Mataji: Thank you very much.

Interviewer: Actually you've just stepped off the plane, I believe.

Shri Mataji: Yes, (?)

Interviewer: Are you suffering from jetlag?

Shri Mataji: No, no. I don't much (?)

Interviewer: How do you avoid things like jetlag?

Shri Mataji: I think if you are at a state where you can witness everything, you don't suffer from that.

Interviewer: How do you mean? What do you mean by, cause everybody's love by (?) sure would want to know how to get over jetlag.

Shri Mataji: It is a state of your being when you just become the spirit. When you become the spirit, then you start seeing everything like a witness, like a drama (?). And you have not involved in that. When you are involved in it, then you (?). You can say that you enter into a realm where the effect and the cause do not exist.

Interviewer: So you become sort of separate from your body to that.

Shri Mataji: Well no, you are beyond it. You are in the body itself. In the body only, you achieve a state where you see everything as if you are witnessing a job.

Interviewer: Right and then how do you overcome, because I know that many branches of yoga, of course, are very much involved with the body and the mind and how the mind can control the body which is quite complex to me.

Shri Mataji: Here, we don't have to control anything. You have a force within you called Kundalini, which is situated in the bone called sacrum, which is sprouted spontaneously here. The living process as the epitome of your evolutionary process and you become the spirit. So there's nothing to be achieved in it. You just become. Becoming is the point.

Interviewer: Many branches of yoga I know are involved in trying to raise this energy if you like called the Kundalini and it's done through meditation in lots of areas. Is that how you do it? Do you meditate it?

Shri Mataji: No, no meditation. Nothing. You see it is a spontaneous thing. I would say that to sprout the seat, you don't meditate. It sprouts by itself.

Interviewer: How do you do it then?

Shri Mataji: It is a living process like the Mother Earth has the power to sprout, you see. In the same way, supposing somebody is enlightened, he can sprout (?) and once you are sprouting, you can also help others. So simple as that.

Interviewer: So could you could raise this energy in me, for example?

Shri Mataji: Of course! Why not? I did for many interviewers who came to me.

Interviewer: How would you do it?

Shri Mataji: Just talking to me, you might get it.

Interviewer: Just by being here?

Shri Mataji: Yes.

Interviewer: What would it feel like if I get it?

Shri Mataji: You will feel the cool breeze coming out of your hands. You will feel the cool breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area on top of your head. It's an actualization of baptism. Actualization, not artificial like somebody puts the hands and baptises you but actually, you feel the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost coming out of here.

Interviewer: I doubt we will feel it at the moment.

Shri Mataji: You will. Very soon.

Interviewer: Well, right now, I'm holding your hand. So I'll just wait and see if it happens. What's the advantage of this? I mean you say that you can use it to help other people. How can you do that?

Shri Mataji: You see because this is the force which connects the all-pervading power of God. And this power does all that is why (?). All that is (?). All that is living. So once you get to that power, when you connect with it, you can manoeuvre that power and use it to help others who are sick because this power is a little bit exhausted (?) or some other problems are there. All of them can be cured if you can just use this power, know how to manoeuvre it and leave it to that. And once they get connected, they are permanently all right.

Interviewer: You said before that you mentioned the Holy Spirit. Now that's really a sort of Christian term and you really espouse all kinds of religion, don't you, not just ...?

Shri Mataji: Christians are like that you see. They want to apportion everything to themselves. Christ was not born for only Christians, nor only Holy Ghost is only for Christians. Holy Ghost is a very, very old understanding in the Universe. It's called Adi Shakti and there will be presented, the presentation of Holy Ghost is in the triangular bone which is the Kundalini. But Christ was not allowed to speak that. He had only four years and they crucified Him. So you can imagine what cost (?) has been the same. How can you live for four years through suffering? I mean it took me years to (?)

Interviewer: So you think, that, would you agree then there is not only one way to achieve union with God or knowledge about God that there all different kinds of Gods.

Shri Mataji: Only one way. Because there's only one way you can sprout the seed. By the pure reason (?) the same way, there's only one thing which is lying as the Kundalini. I don't know of any other force that can act (?) more like that. That's the one kept there for this purpose only.

Interviewer: Does that mean that somebody can only inherit this power by, through somebody like You or can they do it by themselves?

Shri Mataji: By themselves, you cannot because a light which is enlightened can enlighten another candle. By itself, the candle cannot get.

Interviewer: So in other words, you have to have a guru.

Shri Mataji: But a good guru, gurus who know the job. The one who takes you to God and not takes your money.

Interviewer: You have a saying (?) that there are a lot of gurus around...

Shri Mataji: That's all it marketing thing, you see. It's a Bryce (?)

Interviewer: So, how do you find the right guru? The one who won't take your money? You never take any money, do you?

Shri Mataji: No, no no. You see, how can you pay? What will you pay? I just don't understand. How much do we pay for our breathing? You see. In the same way, what can we pay about? But quieter (?) guru is now, this, very difficult because I know, those, there are some good ones, they don't want to come out. They're having this. Best is, you become the guru as soon as you get your Kundalini awakened in Sahaja Yoga, you become your own guru. You don't need anyone. Because you become your spirit and the spirit is look (?).

Interviewer: Let's talk about your schools for a moment and as I mentioned here in the introduction, you are going to start up a school here in Victoria. How do they differ from the usual schools?

Shri Mataji: Very much different, you see because first of all, we see that the children become the spirit. They are born also sometimes as realised children. They are very sensitive to people and to the (?) and they are a very different type, very high moral children. And they can't bear something nonsensical.

Interviewer: How would...?

Shri Mataji: Because of modern times, force them into things they don't like. All such children, they will be agitated at school by being (?) them as realised souls, gradually they understand that they are very much appreciated, wanted. Not only that but they take very easily to morals. You don't have to tell them. They become moral inside (?). They become moral. They know what is right and they're not forced into (?) I say and the education also, they become really dynamic. They learn things very well. They get very disciplined. They know how to respect others. Apart from that, they are very peaceful children. I've seen now that you can (?) children have become so worried because of the families and all kinds of troubles etc. The children feel very insecure but once they get their realization, then they are going securely the school. They have given all securities. They have a regular brochure on that, what we want to do about these schools and then we are going to have once a big school in India, on an international level, where we will get children or such children for higher education there. Then we will tell them what problems are caused by the human understanding of a problem and how we can sort them because we have to have one world. We cannot have a world which is divided among themselves by (?). So, this is what is to create such citizens who will be the world citizens.

Interviewer: Well, I figured (?). Couldn't agree (?) with it more. So, if anyone is interested in contacting you about the school or contacting your organisation about the school, I haven't gotten a phone number here but I'll get one anyway and we'll give it to you a bit later on. Have you got the brochure there? Right, here we go.

Shri Mataji: And tonight and tomorrow, they should come to my program. Tonight and tomorrow at the Exhibition building.

Interviewer: Right, the Exhibition building's at 7 pm tomorrow and phone number for your information.

Shri Mataji: Tonight.

Interviewer: 801339. It's 801339. You're also called Mother, I've been briefed.

Shri Mataji: Yes.
Interviewer: Do you like that?

Shri Mataji: Of course, very much because self-realisation is your second birth and because I give them second birth, that's why they call me the Mother, the Holy Mother.

Interviewer: Well, it's very good to have you with us here in Australia. Thank you for being here. Good luck with the school and if you'd like to go along to see Shri Mataji tonight and tomorrow night, it's at the Exhibition building at 7 pm and there is no charge.

Shri Mataji: Of course.

Interviewer: Thanks very much for being here.

Shri Mataji: Thanks, thank you.
