Yeah, first of all, I'll give you a little sense of the lecture that.

The creator of this institution was Garge Marraj, and the gentleman who is looking after is the one who spoke to you in Marathi. His name is Mr. Zaba. And he doesk everywhere, but and then he gets money for this institution. And this is the institution of children. Of the parents You have to go from places to places. They are like the sea. Getting jobs somewhere if they have to, they're the ones who break big boulders of. Stones and make them into smaller stones for the purpose of road breeding or anything like that, all that kind of work they do, so they can't stick on to one place and they're worried about their children. The schools impartification of the matriculation and these children are kept here in the hostel, and they said that 250 children.

So I'm the hospital and 50 hours is hot. That's it you can hear it. Somebody has now donated a piece of land to me very near where I was staying, plus we might be able to acquire some more land here nearby. Under these circumstances, I think Brahmapury will make a good, very good. Place for you to come and work out on the children because they have to have some professional education also. I think only the education in 3 hours is not going to be helpful for their future life. They have to be given some professional education in some mechanism and all that which we have to think about and you have to come and teach them these things. I told them they'll do it free, of course. Yeah, as a result has said that. Poverty anywhere is a pledge to prosperity everywhere.

You have to go faster, all these people. God they are going to show you. A special thing called bulka, as you say, it's a single bar you don't have in your country. And I'm very happy to see them because this is the place of the round he found out. He was and he was Hanuana himself and he believed in very good health and all. His effort was to build up the health of people if they don't have proper health. They cannot be good examples of God. And that is why I'm very happy to see that this practise here in Nangapur as a blessing of Sri Ramadas. You all know about him very well, but this side of his life that he wanted people to build up their health like Havana. Is been practised in Aur and they have come all the way to show you this special.

Bodybuilding thing they do it on one pillar. You don't need much space for that. It's a very wonderful thing they have got. So I wanted to thank this institution for organising this programme. Also, you will see this beautiful. Uh. It's just an empty. Thirdly, the people from Sataa want to give. You are present to every sector, to every country, I should say. All the 15 countries that are here, they want to give some presents, and that we'll do later on once this is finished.
