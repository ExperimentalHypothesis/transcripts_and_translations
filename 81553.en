 (England)
I got my realisation in Australia, but I came to England very soon after, about four or five months later. I never thought of myself as a seeker. Somebody told me afterward, "Oh, I always picked you as a seeker." I thought, "What's a seeker?" I didn't even know the word "guru." At that stage, you'd think my lifestyle was one where I had everything I could want: a nice flat overlooking the harbor in Sydney and a fast car. But there was a big hole in my life. I reached an emotional state where everything was starting to fall apart and go wrong.

I had come back from a long-haul trip, and I was tired. I was just going into the supermarket to get some milk and stock up when this girl who lived near my flat, who I knew very vaguely, saw me. She was often asking me to parties, and I always thought, "Well, she's crazy. I'm never going to her parties." She said, "Oh, how are you going?" and I've gone, "Oh, God, my life is like this." So I'm having this great whinge to her, and she's banging me on my left shoulder the whole time. I thought, "Why is she hitting me on the left shoulder?" I was so tired, just having a nice whinge.

She said, "What you need is this lady," and she pulled up her pendant. I've gone, "Oh, okay then." I thought, "Nice." She said, "You come to my house on Sunday night." This was a Friday, August 1st, 1980. I remember that. Having turned down parties she'd invited me to before, I spontaneously said, "Okay, I'll come."

I remember walking to the dairy department to get my milk and standing there thinking, "I don't feel tired anymore." I felt this rush of energy. It was fantastic, amazing. I had wanted to give up cigarettes, and I never had another one. I went home and wrote "Dear John" letters and sorted out my love life. I had no idea what was happening; everything was just suddenly falling into place. All I had seen was Mother's picture on the pendant.

I went to her place on Sunday, and they sat me down in the kitchen, put Mother's picture there, and said, "Put your hands out." I thought, "What? I knew I shouldn't have come to this crazy woman's place." They were saying, "Oh, she's got it! Look at her eyes! Can you feel it?" I thought, "No, I can't feel anything. Oh, dear." Anyhow, they gave me the picture, sent me home, and said, "By the way, she's God." I've gone, "Okay."

As a flight attendant, I was pretty down-to-earth. I do remember putting that black and white photograph of Shri Mataji down by the gear stick of my car and driving home, thinking, "Well, who am I to say she's not?" I give myself credit for having an open mind. Because she told me that straight off, I thought it was between her and me, and we had to work this out. If I'd come to a public program, listened to a lecture, or looked at the Sahaja Yogis around me, I would have gone, "No, no, no, they're all crazy." The seeking for me... I didn't even know the word guru. It was more that I had to have the answer this lifetime. That's all I knew. I didn't want to be 80 years old with that blank look on my face, thinking it's all over and I still don't know the answer. I thought, "I'm not dying till I get the answer."

And I always knew that something special was going to happen to me when I was 35. I was always going on about turning 35. They said, "What's so special about that?" I've gone, "I don't know. It's just that that's when I'm going to be complete." They said, "What do you mean?" I thought, "I don't know what I mean, but I'm going to be complete." Of course, it was my 35th year that I got my realization.

I had made such a fuss about turning 35 that my sister had given me a surprise birthday party, which was the most disastrous night of my life. She'd just gone through my address book and invited everybody. I said, "Why did you do this? It was horrible. You had the plumber there, people I never wanted to meet." It was just such a dreadful night. She said, "Well, you've made such a fuss about turning 35 all your life, I thought we'd better do something special for you." But it was some months later that I actually got my real birthday present, on August 1st, 1980.

Transferring my job to London was a miracle, orchestrated by Shri Mataji from beginning to end. So I guess I was a seeker after all.
