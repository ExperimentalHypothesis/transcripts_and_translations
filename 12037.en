Akola (India)
Talk Language: Hindi | Translation (Hindi to English) - Draft

Yes, first of all one thing must be understood, that the people who have come here from Mumbai and Delhi are not guests.

The guests are the people who have come from outside. The buses have come with their money. You are not giving even a single penny for that. Not even a penny. The buses are theirs. You people just captured the buses and came here. Left the buses here. Those people are standing stranded on the road. Instead of caring for those people, you reached here comfortably. Came back and are sitting comfortably and half the people are sitting on the road - the buses are rotting here.

You people have not come here as guests, please pay attention. Change these habits of yours. You have come here to serve and these people who have come from outside are guests. You board any bus you want, as if you have hired the bus. Last time I paid forty-five thousand rupees for you people to get on the bus. It is better that you all come on foot. And if not, then one thing can be done that there is just one bus for you. You people come out at any time; There is no time for you, nothing. Only one bus will come and that bus will come twice. You will be allowed to sit in that bus only, you cannot sit in any other bus.

Have you understood? You sat down comfortably and all others are standing there stranded - is this a good thing? These are their buses, they have given so much money, that's why we have buses today. Because of them Sahaja Yoga is going on today. Now you will give all the buses [UNCLEAR]. The number of one of those buses will be told here. And no Indian person will sit in any other bus. There is a bus for you, and it will go, come, go, come, and if you are not ready, then come on foot. Here you can't just arrange a bus for 24 hours. Although we have made arrangements for it - that's okay.

But this doesn't mean that whatever time you want you get up at your convenience, just like a king - take their buses and come. It's just as if you snatched somebody's vehicle and came by it. Now there is only one bus for you. It will go there and come back. Now in the morning you people have to - these people wake up early in the morning and meditate. Learn something from them. One should learn from them their ways and methods and how much discipline they have. The second thing is that they look after your comfort, not their own. We have booked one bus for you, that's it. We cannot give you more than that.

Who will pay for it? We will tell you the number of one bus. That bus will go and come back. Otherwise you can come on foot, what's the problem? Walk a little, it's good for health. The bus will come in the morning. In the morning time we want you to be there. You can bathe and get ready there and breakfast will be served to you there only. Or if you want, come here on a single bus - you are not many people. You are only 110 people; you can come in two buses.

Once the bus will go, will come back, then you will go and then come back, but do not touch the rest of the buses. - I will have to pay for all that. Will you people give me forty-five thousand rupees? Who told you to sit on these buses? You boarded whichever bus and came here. There should be some rules and regulations. Should ask, 'Which bus should we take and which we should not take?' Now please be kind. The bus which is for you, you only board that bus in the morning come here and your breakfast... [MARATHI] your breakfast will be served there but you don't need to live like a lord. Get up early in the morning, take a bath, do meditation and after meditation the breakfast will be served there.

You will get the breakfast there at half past eight. After having your breakfast there from 8:30 to 9:30 and there is a bus and if you cannot come by that bus, then please come on foot. People from Bombay, people from Poona, and people from Delhi - people from Poona and Bombay are living in Malgun It's accepted that you people are living there. But that doesn't mean that you can take their buses and easily come here. Should ask, "Which bus is ours, by which bus will we come?" First thing. Secondly, at what time should we come? Right now all those people are stranded, sitting there for four hours, nobody has even asked whether those people have come or not. Those people have been standing there for four hours. You sat down, you are not concerned about anyone.

Came here and settled down comfortably. You people are not guests here. This is your country, Hindustan. People have come here from outside. You are in India, and while being in India you are still on the shores, have not become the ocean. You understood it, right? Please be kind, I feel very sad thinking that these poor people have been stranded there for four hours. You people first, 'Let's rush in fast, let's move quickly.' They are saying that, 'Everyone entered beforehand, wildly, what could we do? We are Sahaja Yogis; we are not those beggars on the street.

There should be some or the other rules and regulations. Now, please, you people are not going to get on to anybody's bus - there's just one bus for you. What is the number of your bus from here? The number of one bus [MARATHI] Firstly, we have come to such a place where we don't get anything. Neither any food and drinks nor anything else. All these things are coming from Kolhapur. We have come here because this is a journey for us - we have come to the region. And in this place we are not guests - these people are guests. Otherwise too, I notice/see that all the Delhi and Mumbai people will sit in the front and these people are sitting at the back. Is this any way to behave with the guests?

First of all we will sit down. We will eat first, they will eat later - is this any way to do it? We people are famous in the world for our hospitality and our manners, we are known in the world for this, but why do we behave otherwise as soon as we come to Sahaja Yoga? Tomorrow onwards, you people are not going to attack them absolutely in any way. And neither are you going to enter their buses; Only one bus is there for you. You come by that otherwise I don't have that much money to give them. [Mr. Nigam, Mr. Nigam] There is a lot to learn - you have come here to learn We have not come to save our lives. What is the harm in walking for young people? What harm will it do if we walk a little? You people have so many tantrums.

It's heard that it takes four-four hours for men and women to get ready. Mr. Nigam, you should keep one bus. There is only one bus for you. Everyone should come and go by that bus. Otherwise, if we want, we can keep you all somewhere else, it will be better. Now tomorrow, we are thinking of shifting you people somewhere else, so that you don't face this problem. Leave their buses for them. These have come and are lying here - they have been sitting on the road for four hours. This is not a good thing. Those poor people give the money.

It is on the basis of their money that Sahaja Yoga is running today - you know that. And these people were telling that, 'All of them pushed each other and sat in the front - we didn't get any space.' And came here and stopped the buses, didn't even think whether the buses went back or not - those people are standing there. Yes, you see all the buses are standing here. Everyone came and sat comfortably here - Delhi people, Mumbai people, Poona people. I feel sad that these poor people have come from such a long distance, they have been travelling for a whole month, have suffered a lot. Comfort-loving is not a characteristic of Sahaja Yoga. A person who likes comfort cannot be a Sahaja Yogi. Then they will tell that when we came, we had trouble for so long, then this happened. A person who faces uneasiness is not a Sahaja Yogi.

In Sahaja Yoga there is the joy of the Spirit, its comfort, its happiness. There should be no discomfort for it, there should be no trouble; one should remain immersed in its bliss. And if still one is looking for comfort here - I heard there are big fights going on who will stay in the dormitory, who will stay where, who will stay where - this is a wrong thing. At least if there are elderly people among those who are now in the tents, it is okay; let them go to the dormitory, the rest of you keep staying there. If your body troubles you, then settle it. You'll have to make it understand. I'm not asking you to go to the Himalayas and stand there in the cold air, on one leg, without clothes. This is not the case. But useless pampering of the body cannot and should not happen in Sahaja Yoga. There is no such problem.

If you go to any other place, go to Shanno Devi, go to any other place, you have to climb seven-seven miles - for that it's fine. There won't be any problem if you exert your body a little. And it's not a matter of great effort also; A nice cool breeze is blowing - can come here walking leisurely. And there is no need to do so much preparation and dressing up so much. There is no puja today, nothing, can't understand. They are saying that no person comes on time. The bus people are standing there. Not even one is boarding the bus right now - this is wrong. Collectivity is less, that's why this happens. Now for you, you said, "We want to come on the first," we said, "Okay, please come, most welcome."

Now this doesn't mean that you are coming here as guests. If you have come on the first, then you make the arrangements. See what's going on, what's not - how can you help? These people have given much, much more money than you people. And this time around Rs 8 lakhs will be saved. Every year we have benefited from their money. I am not saying that money is everything, but they are guests. If tomorrow you go to their country, then they will never do this. They will first make arrangements for you. Everyone rushed in and came.

Tomorrow morning, all of you should wake up early and go into meditation by eight o'clock. After meditation from eight to nine [MARATHI] you will get breakfast there at nine o'clock. Now it is not like if one person is sitting then two others are not sitting. Someone who does not come there at nine o'clock, will not get breakfast. Breakfast will go from here to there. After that you all please come here by 10 o'clock. You have time from nine to ten, you can have your breakfast by then, after doing everything by ten o'clock you're here. Leave from there, there is a bus for you, that same bus will come, you can reach here by that bus. Then we will return that bus, then you can come here (again) by that bus. In this way you can come and go by the same bus.

We cannot pay for six buses. Another thing is that if a driver has to work for more than eleven hours, double the money has to be paid. From tomorrow the program will start here from 11 o'clock. Everyone should reach here by 11 o'clock. There will be a program here from 11 am to 1 pm. Whatever we do in it, whether we give speeches or do anything, will do. The program will start properly from tomorrow. And after that you don't need to go. You may eat here and lie down here as well if you wish. You may have tea etc.

and then leave. After having tea, you go there, get ready in the evening time and after that you should leave from there around six o'clock, by six or half past six. So here your program will start from six o'clock - six, seven, eight o'clock. And after that, till nine-nine thirty, maybe till ten o'clock, after you have had your meals, there will be a two-hour music program. This sort of arrangement is there - or six, seven, eight [MARATHI] [MARATHI] This is how it can be done. At the most it will take half an hour to walk from here to there. But now we have got used to the chairs - we can't walk that much. Anyways, I'm not asking you to walk but at least understand this, that if you sit in every bus, My condition will become worse. Last time you did the same thing and put me in a lot of trouble. [MARATHI] 7965 Okay, the number of the vehicle is 7965; The driver's number is, Mr. Patil.

[MARATHI] 
And they say this to them, and when I said they started dicussing. [MARATHI] Now I must not be displeased - we must keep the Goddess pleased. Should be kept pleased and is pleased when austerity comes in a person. Comfort loving people cannot do Sahaja Yoga. They can fight, can argue, can talk nonsense, can say all kinds of scandalous/odious things, but comfort-loving people cannot do Sahaja Yoga. You people should stay here once you come here. Stay here after having your meals if you want to have tea, because who will now run with the tea for you? [MARATHI] Yes, so they are saying that after having food here, there is a bus which will take you, the same bus will then take the other party and they will send tea along with it, then you have tea there and after having tea, you all come back by the same bus. And it's My instruction, that any person who is an Indian, must travel by the same bus. Otherwise these people will report tomorrow and a lot of money will have to be paid.

These bus people are also yours. And this is your government and your own expenditure. I am told of such huge expenditures, what can I do? Have you understood? So now please be kind, you do not have the right to sit in any bus you want to according to your wish. Just one bus has been arranged for you; Whatever will be its cost, we will pay it. If you don't want to give then don't give. Just one - have you understood? There's no need to take a single rupee from them - it's useless. We will settle those accounts.

But those who do not come in the bus will remain there. Please do not come by someone else's bus. If even one person sits in another bus, I will have to pay a lot for it. So please be kind to Me. This happened last time, and it's happening this time too. Those who are elderly should shift to dormitories, wherever they have to go And those who are coming will also stay in the dormitory. A bus will be over there for you. You can come and go by that - one bus is enough. In Delhi too you people stand in queues for hours. Has Lordship come in here?

Well, [UNCLEAR- ANY?] whatever it is. Today did not start off well, I'm feeling very sad. Poor people have been standing there for four hours. You did not let anyone come and brought the bus here and left it - it's a matter of great sadness. So now ask for forgiveness in your heart and say, "Mother, I will not do such a thing next time onwards. A very wrong thing has happened and feel very sorry." Now I will tell you about the next programmes, which you should listen to. In the next program, our program will be as I told you. That there will be meditation after waking up in the morning, then you come here by 11 o'clock, You reach here after having breakfast etc and stay here till lunch time.

After that go back, take some rest, then drink tea and after having tea etc and again, while coming here in the evening, remember that you have to reach here by six o'clock. So the bus will come there, come by the first bus at six o'clock, then come by the second bus, and then we'll start the program here from six,six-thirty. Otherwise it doesn't take much time; it's just that you people don't care about them. Should care for them, should ask, 'Did you have any tea etc or not?' And from tomorrow the program will be in this manner. Tomorrow is not the 4th, it is the 3rd - tomorrow is the 3rd. More people are coming on the 3rd. And the people who have to shift on the 3rd will be shifted and your tents will also be brought here and set up. So it would be better if tomorrow you all stay there only after tea, after breakfast. And your - because your tents are going to be moved from there.

And your stuff - Now like when these foreigners came, they picked up all their stuff and brought it with them. Had to call a tempo for you people because you never carry things by your hands. Have never done till date, we are not coolies. Everyone is a Prime Minister here. So for that too, you people put your luggage in the same bus and bring it here. The tents will be pitched here; The tents will be taken down/dismantled tomorrow morning. When you go for meditation, before that the tents will be dismantled and set up here, so that you will have the convenience of bathrooms and all the arrangements will be made. So after having your meal here you go and stay there. Now whatever your luggage is, that luggage you have to take it to those tents, before you go to eat. So for tomorrow morning's program you people should have a program that you shift your arrangements from there to the tents.

So as soon as you wake up tomorrow morning, you will have one task that - these people may do whatever they like, because they are stationed there only - Pack up all your stuff, get everything in order, and be prepared, tomorrow the tents will be dismantled and the tents will be set up here. And your arrangement will be made here, where there are plenty of bathrooms You won't have trouble; you just have to pick up your luggage and bring it here. Those people, you can lift up, these people cannot. Okay, raise your hands who all can lift up. Just two men and no one else? What about women, won't women pick up? Come on, pick it up and bring it. There is no arrangement here. There is no other arrangement for lifting the luggage, so what should we do? [MARATHI] Okay, a tempo will come.

A tempo will come for those who cannot lift it at all. As such foreigners will also help you. We have to request all the people, who have come here all the way from all other countries, for one thing, I'm sorry that, you see, there has been no proper direction to these people and they occupied all the buses and so many foreigners were left behind. There are five buses for the foreigners, only one bus, five....
