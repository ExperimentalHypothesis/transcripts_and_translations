Shri Ram Navami Puja Calcutta 25/03/1991

(Talk in Hindi.)

We have gathered here on the occassion of Ram Navami. Everybody has said, "Mother please tell us about Shri Ram."

As you know that Shri Rama has taken a very important place in our chakras. He is sitting on our right heart. Shri Rama has taken a place of a father, so lack of father's duty and love can cause a catch of this chakra. In Sahaja Yoga we can understand that Rama and all other gods came on earth with different power [shakti], they came to do their jobs. In the sense Shri Rama has a special job. Socrates has said benevolent king has to come. For that Shri Rama came.

Shri Rama came in complete human form. He even forgot that he is an incarnation of Shri Vishnu. He was made to be forgotten. But he was Purushottam on earth [perfect human being]. You all must have heard of his qualities and his childhood.

In Sahaja yoga when we worship any god, what quality we gain from them, which qualities we will receive? Shri Rama has many. One that he was ideal, another that he is a king. He kept his people higher than himself than his wife and children. If politicians today understand this point they wouldn't be called selfish, they wouldn't be selfish, would be follower of Dharma.

Nobody has followed Shri Rama as a role model till today. By singing his bhajans or building institutions and temples in his name does Shri Rama come to you? Do you get his light in your life? Only a Sahaja Yogi can bring the light of Shri Rama into the attention.

He is totally beyond. Basically, all the deities are free from papas and punyas so called sins, they never sin. Shri Krishna killed many people. Shri Rama killed Ravana. It can be a sin in worldly sense but not in the eyes of God. As they destroy and remove evils they have rights to do anything. When Devi slayed Rakshas has she committed a sin? Their work is to destroy the rakshasas and protect the saints.

In Shri Rama's life Ahilya's saving is the most important. She was cursed by her husband. In those times if any women go out of dharma and if her husband is high saint he could curse. But Ahilya was blamed falsely. And she was made into stone falsely. So shri Rama saved Ahilya.

Especially his quality to have only one wife, his love to one wife must be understood. Even though he knew Sitaji is Mahalaxmi. She herself is a Goddess. But as a Human he never looked at any other women but his wife.

When we talk about Rama, we should have the husband pure. To worship shri Rama, women should have the same faith in husbands as Sitaji used to. Husbands also need the quality of Shri Ram who believed one wife. Not difficult for Sahaja Yogis. Women should be respected. Have respect for wifes.

When Ravana kidnapped Sitaji, Shri Rama felt his duty to rescue her. But in his kingdom, he was so just that for people he left her after spending so many years to rescue. As Sitaji herself a Devi so there's no effect. So, Shri Rama did it to keep the benevolence of public opinion. That society wouln't accept the women who are questioned, although she is a Devi Pure and Nirmala.

Later that Sita also left him. Somehow, She left him as a woman and Shri Rama as a man. Sitaji disappeared into the mother earth and Shri Rama went into River Sarayu

Their life is very eventful and full of Miracles. You see how shri Sita and Rama have good attitude and are faithful each other.

Even if she was left Sita thought it her duty. She never complained or talked ill of him. And effortlessly she has raised her children. Shri Rama's children are called Luv and Kush. They came as devotees and we can see them as disciples. They represent Shisya [disciples]. The power of Shisya. So we can be disciple of someone. As disciples they learned archery when they were small. And learned Ramayana and got proficiency in the music showing the disciples must surrender completely to the Guru. We also have a disciple in us.

They were completely surrendered to the Mother who is Shakti. Even they were about to fight against Shri Rama. They kept Mother highest in the world. The mother cared them and made them completely dharmic. It was her first duty.

Not like today wives just cry, "My husband left me". But with husband they fight always and if he leaves, they will cry.

"He has left no problem I have children, I will care for them, they will get all they need." Sitaj's life was special with bravery and strength. Every woman must have it. Even if you are separated with your husband or far away there shouldn't be any loss or shortage for children. Because her duty is the most important thing. We shouldn't give up most important thing. In Sahaja Yoga all women should get this power.

Shri Rama's life was very pure and Nirmal. He gave up everything for his wife. His wife had gone, he had to live alone and he had to leave her. He gave up all the comforts of the life. You know he used to sleep on grass, on floor and walked barefeet and wear clothes like saints. All these are not stories, it's a fact.

In India many people used to have high standard life and they have never thought about small and low-level things. But all these ideals of our country have become fake. By singing bhajans to Ram we think we are done. We have got a kind of hypocracy. In countries without these ideals people try to become the ideals correcting themselves. If you have the ideal in front of us, you don't become Shri Rama or Krishna or you have anything to do with them. We feel like that.

But if we have Shri Rama inside, his light can be in our attention. Let's understand the circumstances when Shri Rama came on earth. Sahaja Yogi must understand. If we get Shri Rama's state, all our political problems will go. When we decide to become like shri Rama, then everyone becomes good, firstly dharma, success and education then the ideals. For that he made his life very idealistic. When someone tells you something but he doesn't do it himself, then how can you trust him and get his quality? There are many people who say we believe in this and that, but they are opposite. Followers of Ram seems to be the biggest fraud politician and they have many wives. Impossible!

What is the duty of Sahaja Yogis' life? We have to bring the light of God in our attention.

We must see and behave as Shri Rama. What would Shri Rama or Sita do in this situation? What would Sitaji say? How would Sita behave? She is also Gruhlaxmi. As you know Sitaji took many births. Gruhlaxmi was in the form of Fatima-bi. She was humbly in the house but all dharma was done by her power. Not necessary for her to go out and give big lectures. You can do that work at home with children relatives and friends. You can spread Sahaja Yoga at the house. After getting all of it you can go out to society.

But ladies have to have purity like Sitaji first. First thing of the purity is motherhood and love. When she was in exile never complained that, "My husband doesn't earn He doesn't do this, he doesn't buy this and that. "If he is in jungle so I am. What he will eat, I wil. I don't eat before him. I serve him first and brother in law, then I will eat."

Nowadays women think there is much pressure of the work, but it is not. A woman is like earth element, she can absorb. So many are given by the earth. In the same way women are like the earth. We have got so many powers that we can take everything inside and shower the rain of love. God has given us the power.

For example, this fan is moving. Which one is greater, the power or fan? If you think fan is greater as it's moving, then it's wrong. Women are ocean of shakti. With that support men do their work. They are potential and kinetic. Women are potential and men are kinetic. But if you start running like them, it's not good. No need for women.

Each one is unique but equally important. But women can be good for both. When the time comes women can be more productive. In Maharashtra there was a 17-year-old widow named Tarabai. She was the daughter-in-law of Shivaji. Only she could defeat Aurangzeb. Her grave was built.

You must understand women can keep all her power within her to become ferocious. But if she wastes her powers in fighting, arguing, complaining or in frivolous things then her power would be gone. Women are so powerful that she can work more than men if she wants. But first of all, she must respect her powers. By scattering and wasting she becomes powerless. This kind of woman is not good.

Women's job is very important and full of dignity. Women should be very modest and very wise. Let men use bad words but women cannot. Men can argue and would fight let them do but not women. Their job is to make peace, protection and helping people. She is like shield not like sword, and sword cannot be shield. Shield is greater than sword as shield can bear the sword. Sword can be broken but not shield

So, her most important power is humility. With humility come all the powers. It's not difficult for Sahaja Yogis, not at all.

I see many Sahaja Yoginis chat a lot, anywhere they will chat with men. "Mother help me. What happened? The lady talks a lot please help me. I am tired of her." There isn't much to talk with men. What's the need? Among women also.

In Sahaja Yoga men study more about Sahaja Yoga and the chakras. Which chakra is driving people and is catching? Man knows. All women would be left behind. Women must learn.

For men Shri Rama is our ideal. In this sense Muslims are amazing. I don't want to say bad things. Say if you go to Riyad no Muslim will see you, they will respect women. If women are crossing the street they will stop the car respecting women. But here it's opposite. I don't know why we see women with some intention. Seeing every woman, they will break the neck. It's a big sin to see every woman.

In Sahaja Yoga it's prohibited completely. Firstly, you will spoil your eyes and Sahaja Yoga. Otherwise you may become blind. Sometimes I see people have wandering eyes while talking eyes are wandering women too.

The biggest loss is your attention. Your attention goes here and there, then what's the use of self-realization? Without concentration Chitta can't be active. Concentration must be obtained.

In the West the disease is more common among men. Western Yogis are not alike. They know it's bad. They asked me the solution. Look at only ground and up to 3 feets, you don't have to see above. Look at the ground. Yogis are walking looking at the ground abroad. You see all good things, flowers and children. Nothing to see above. So, that's how you should control your chitta.

Shri Rama didn't need it. If you have a respect to Shri Rama, you must control your chitta like him. Tell your wife you respect her as shakti. But she has to deserve it, "Yatr naryan pujante tatr ramante devata", "Where women are respected resides God." But they have to be respectable. Please sit down. Don't move during Puja. If the woman is worshipable: 'pujyante' means 'worshipable'. Who like to worship a bad woman cruel Rakshasi? Those who are worship-able should be worshipped. There reside gods.

Firstly, they are mothers of children. If husband scolds wife in front of children then children will never respect mother. It's prime minister and deputy minister. Women shouldn't insult her husband too. Power goes to children from father. Without this basic understanding they fight to take control.

If woman knows handling of man there won't be any fights. Handling men is very easy as they are just like children, they are innocent like children. By talking nonsense, you can't handle them. You must forgive them as children. If they fight outside they get troubled. They can get angry only to wife. Getting angry at home is OK. Until you get this feeling, you cannot have mutual understanding, love and joy.

Men also should care for wife's needs. If wife is wrong, husband has duty to say, "No, it's wrong, I won't do this." But no need to fight on small things. It doesn't look good as Sahaja Yogis.

I am surprised that sahaja couples fight each other. They come to complain about each other. How come sahaja couple cannot be together peacefully while I'm talking about peace to the whole world? It won't work out if you are fighting like that. Husband has to have complete understanding of his wife first. And know that all the other women are like your sisters and mothers.

If someone is not clean even after Sahaja Yoga then there's no way out. There was a swiss man, not a Sahaja Yogi, not Indian. He was a father of a Sahaja Yogini. Girl's husband had wandering eyes but came to Sahaja Yoga. They both came to Sahaja Yoga. The girl is very good but he went on doing it. The non-yogi father told her to leave him, "Even after Sahaja Yoga if he can't be cleansed, then leave him. He is not a Sahaja Yogi, don't relate with him."

Even non-Sahaja Yogi can understand that the person can't be cleansed. He doesn't have stable attention then it is bad. Our culture is that men and women must be brother and sister. But I see a talkative woman just go to talk to men. I don't understand it. They don't sit with other ladies but with men. Same with men, just start chatting with women. Even with maid or anyone just start talking. No self-esteem. We think it's masculinity.

But Shri Rama is the perfect man who is highest. But the ones at the bottom think they are perfect. Where is perfection? Not believing in Shri Rama but in devil.

If you believe in Shri Rama follow his ideal Therefore children and women are getting spoiled. But still Indian women maintained good culture here. If they were like Americans what it would have been? Men are fixed in terrible condition there. After 2-3 marriages men become bankrupt but women make a palace. It's bad in America. Children are running away from home. Indian women manage their house, husband and children. But it's changing. They think the same like husbands, "If he runs away with 10 women then we go with 15 men. If he is going to hell then I go before him." Women shouldn't do it.

The base of dharma is in woman's hand. Woman must manage husband dharmic making him understand. This is the biggest duty and power of woman to be Dharmaic.

Biggest dharma is forgiveness. Without it nothing works out. First thing she must have forgiveness. Forgive children, husband, give refuge to house servants, all are her duty. This is the work that Shri Rama couldn't do neither Shri Krishna nor Shri Jesus. Rama would have killed everyone who is useless, adharmic and flirt. Don't know how many he would be finished. Krishna would use his sudarshan chakra and there would be a battle. Christ would crucify himself. One crucifiction is better than everyday.

Only Mother can do this work with such a power of love. Anything can be worked out with her power of love. She holds everything with so much love that children don't mind correcting.

For instance, when trouble comes only mother knows how to handle it and scold later because children understands mother's love and it is for them. With father children may react but not with mother's love without expectation. She doesn't want anything but her children to be good and get all my powers, all good in me. If mother feels it children will be fine.

But some mothers are very interfering and get involved in everything. She comes always in front while husband is at the back. Children will be spoiled by it. Under such harmful environment children can be very emotional. So, woman should be behind and make her husband in front. Whatever husbands do wifes must help him behind. The source of his power is wife. Then how pure and hard-working she should be.

I put everything on woman because I know you have great powers inside. Look at me as a Mother I must make everyone saints. Curing many diseases to make people saints. Did anyone do this job? Only Ahilya was saved. Jesus saved 21 people. I must have saved 21000 now. Going around the world to do everyone's job it's still going on but I don't feel because of love. Maybe I should put bandhan as I don't know what kind of people I meet. But as soon as people comes to me I absorb all the problems. So, love acts by itself. I know everything is done by love. I don't feel bad whatever happens. Only Mother can bear the pain.

So, I want you to grow consistantly without hurdles.

Also, men should help their wives fully, understand and respect them. Until the 2 wheels get balanced the chariot doesn't go forward. They both should be the same but one on the left and the other on the right. It won't work if you change it. It is moving and working because they are the same but unique. Same in the sense of height, length and width, but they work differently. It's the same in our life.

Shri Rama didn't think only about husband and wife. Didn't think only about children and family. Also, of brother, sister, mother, father and everyone as a normal human being. After he thought about society, about public, state and country.

As a human being he has shown human ideals in his activities. The person who loved his wife so much, knew she was pure and hed left her. Now people give so much to their own wife but they never give to poor people. Otherwise they give to their relatives. It's a disease among politicians.

But the one who has wife who is sakshat devi had to leave her. We must understand it's attachment to relatives and possessions.

In West marriage relation wasn't alright but after Sahaja Yoga wife became everything. Here leaders had to leave because their wives were not alright. Their attention got spoiled by wife's preaching. At least five Yogis left because of their wives. Wives should understand Sahaja Yoga and their role in it. In this case husbands shouldn't agree with their wives at all. Tell her that, “You talk and move too much. Be quiet You are useless. Your chakras are not alright." She will be alright only in this way. But instead you blame yourself and obey your wife? If she tells you to steal, you do it? Even after Sahaja Yoga you still have some catches to take care.

On the occasion of Shri Rama Hanuman should be remembered as his great devotee. And how he was busy at his service. He was aware that his life is for serving Shri Rama.

We should have his awereness in Sahaj Yoga. But it doesn't mean you cook food for me which I don't eat. You trouble me cooking so much this and that. Don't keep on serving someone forcefully.

What we need is zeal to serve [sewa]. Hanuman didn't serve food to Shri Rama. Delhi people kept on serving food so much that I had to tell them, "I wouln't come if you don't stop." Do what you have to do. It's bad to force someone to eat serving one after another. I don't need anything and I am tired. I told you only flowers. But don't spend too much also. A lot of flowers make me worry sometimes.

Please your Mother in balance. She is a simple woman who don't understand these. We have to learn that zeal to serve is from Hanumaji. There is no special service for me.

But if you want to serve me serve to Sahaj Yoga. Serving to Sahaja Yoga is serving to me. How many realisations have you given? How many did you transform and inspire? But if you say to new people they have bhoot, they just leave.

One gentleman was told he has 3 bhoots in him so he left Sahaja Yoga. He was told number of bhoots even! He believed it because the Yogi was an authority in the local area. I don't know who but the person left.

So, what we have to learn from Hanuman is the zeal, "Ram kaj karne ko tatpar" [eager to do Ram's work]. What is our work? My work is Sahaja Yoga. My work is Sahaja Yoga, to raise kundalini to make people peaceful and lovable, talking about love. Talk about Sahaja Yoga, about chakras makes them understand

Doesn't mean you start giving lecture. Some people started to give so much lecture. I had to tell them to stop. Otherwise Sahaja Yoga will be finished. Only long lectures. No time for Mother's talk and Aarti. He said he just can't stop. He doesn't know why. "How can I fix it?" "You put supari [spice] in your mouth." Then, "How much?" "It depends on the size of your mouth. You don't know it even then how come you talk about Sahaja Yoga. You don't know it even."

People like giving lecture. Get on a stage and won't leave a mic. Once with mic they can't leave. It's a new disease. So you must understand why to give lecture. There are so many Mother's talks you can put a tape or video in every program. After people can write question on paper. And ask them to bring it next program if there are someone who is sick or in trouble.

Now there is a Yogi. He comes to cure in Calcutta. Now he was called to Russia. One person is running like Hanuman all over to cure. You all can cure. All women can do. All men also. But nobody tries. By giving lecture how many were cured? I don't know why only one in India, don't know what's the matter that till now there is only one man in India who can cure people. In London there are 15~20 people who can cure and in France also. One should learn working on people like giving bandhan. No need to invite someone from abroad. Remove Sahaja Yoga badges if you cannot cure. How do you work on others if you can't cure even yourself? Everybody has got all the powers to cure anyone. Learn to become masters instead of inviting someone. They should go out to cure. Just have some courage to wor. Nothing will happen. By working, you become deeper like a tree grows deeper as it expands.

Sahaja Yogis are very much different from Incarnations. They have never worked in society before. Nobody had the power for a mass. Only one to one like King Janaka to Nachiketa. But now you all have it. Just grow it, that's all. Cure yourself and others. Understand Sahaja Yoga, you have everything.

But still your attention is wondering. What are you running after? You still don't understand it. Sahaja Yoga is just blessing. You won't be in short of anything. Just work for Sahaja Yoga. Even if you don't work you will be blessed business or promotion, this and that. Everyone is blessed and nothing to give up.

Otherwise in time of freedom fight we were tortured, lied on ice, got electric shocks. My parents went to jail. Our house was sold. Lived in a hut. Had to sacrifice a lot.

And you don't have to do it. But not only receiving. You have to give. If one door is open so should be the other one. Only one doesn't work. Everyone reports me about blessings they got. We must see what we have done for others.

But there are many fights for leadership. It's all Mother's play. You will know it when you will fall from there. Specially women shouldn't get involved. They fall very soon. And men should know there is nothing like ministers. This is Mother's play. Don't get involved in.

Why I call a leader? It's a play. There are no leaders. It's just a test if you have ego. If you have, you are gon. It will be shown immediately. In Sahaja Yoga everything gets exposed. Even if I say something it shows on the faces. Once some leaders came and confessed their mistakes. They have more responsibilities to be better, sweet, humble and loving and become close and sharing with everyone.

Now on the auspicious occasion of Shri Rama we must understand what he had shown. Only a bit of it would please our Mother. He was in exile for a long time in jungle. Walked barefeet, worked so hard just to obey his father. Now to obey me you don't need to go into exile, not barefeet, nor starving, nothing. All are there for you. But you must know how to cure people in Sahaja Yoga, everything about sahaj yoga and mostly about love. It's nothing but power of love. Everybody will be benefited. This is not only for special people. This is not only for one country but for the whole world.

Watch how your attention is. If it's disturbed we should correct it. Put the power of Spirit in it. Do everything with concentration. And devotion and love will make you deep.

Otherwise there is lots of rubbish. If you wish to stay like rubbish you know where it goes at the end. If you want to feel you are specially good, capable of anything, first humility, not only towards me but everyone. Talk humbly with love and show that people can blossom like lotus in Sahaja Yoga to spread fragrance everywhere. People will tell me you are wonderful if you will do it in that way.

One day you too will be called as Maryada Purushottama. You are the temple of Rama so have it within yourself. Perform puja to it. Take care of your self-esteem. Take the benefit of self-realization inside yourself. You must have respect and devotion to it: "Now we are realized. How can we do wrong? We are Yogis!" Soon you will have blessings immediately. As I am called Rokhada [cash] Devi, you will get blessing as soon as you assert it. Everyone is getting blessed with it give it back to the world.

Shri Rama used all his powers for the benevolence of people to show the ideal. You will be surprised to achieve so high when the time comes. You won't have any disease and all bad habits will be dropped. You will eat, talk and watch as much as you need. You will watch your mind for introspection: "Where is my mind going? I'm a Sahaja Yogi, stop it." By doing so you will be in meditation. Your Kundalini will be satisfied and give you blessings. You say, "Mother, what a blessing?" But you have to jump into it. Only then will you know it. Till then you need to work hard.

Shri Rama was born at midnight so let's have puja late. Shri Rama Puja is not a specially long one. As he is in a human form he is humanity within us by which we understand our intellect and our thoughts get changed. Shri Rama is that through him we can change our thoughts. Our nature can change because he is our ideal.

After achieving his ideals, we reach another because he was human ideal. It is great that God came to this world in a human form to became our ideal. He has gone through all the hardships to show us strength to keep Dharma. That is Vishwa Dharma and the state of yoga

May God bless you all!

Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi
