Shri Ram Navami Puja Calcutta 25/03/1991

You know that Shri Rama has very important place on our chakra, He is situated on our right heart, Shri Rama has taken the place of father hence if there is lack in the responsibility or love from father this chakra is caught up. In Sahaja Yoga we to understand that Shri Rama and all other deities have taken the form to fulfil their divine work, in all Shri Rama had a special task. As it was said by Socrates that the benevolent king has to come the same way Shri Rama had come on this earth as Benevolent king, he came in the form of human being, he even forgot that he was incarnation of Shri Vishnu, forgot about him but for all world he was purshotama Rama. In Sahaja Yoga we need to know when we pray any deity, we have imbibed the specialties and qualities of the particular deity with in us, Shri Rama had many qualities,

You all know his childhood life and you have already heard about his qualities, he was Purushotama, he had another quality that in his ruling, he did not care for his wife or children’s in front of his subjects view. If today’s politicians understand this point, they will drop the selfishness, they will become religious, nobody has yet tried to imbibe him in one self, just by singing his bhajans and building his temples he is not going to entire with in your being, can in your life his power will come doing this ? Only sahaja yogis can bring his light to their attention of Shri Rama besiding in them, he was impartial,

As such all the deities are above sins and puniyas like Shri Krishna killed so many demons Shri Rama killed Ravana with our worldly views it might be sin but according divine views it is not because they killed the negative peoples, they took out the negativity for this they had all rights to do whatever was necessary, as like the goddess killed the demons some people will think that it was sin but it was not for the protection of saints.

In life time of Shri Rama the benevolence of Ahilya is big incident, he freed her from her curse, Ahilya had got cursed by her husband, in those days if any lady was misbehaving and her husband was a saint or sadhu he would give her curse, but Ahilya had false accusation and got cursed to become stone and Shri Rama freed her.

His “ek patni vratha “ promise of dedication on his only wife  was very special although he knew that Shri Sita was Shri Mahalaxmi form and goddess herself, in the human form he never looked upon any other women, when we speak about Shri Rama we need to imbibed and keep clean this quality. If any women is thinking of Shri Rama she need to have respect towards her husband in Sahaja yoga this is not difficult, we need to respect women.

When ravana took away Shri Sita, Shre Rama felt it was his responsibility to free her but due to his subjects view he left her alone after long years fight,

Shri Sita was an goddess herself and leaving her had no effect but he did it just to keep his subject point of view and also to give a good image, although Shri Sita was completely nishkalanka, goddess and pure, When Shri Rama sacrifice Shri Sita she sacrificed Shri Rama as normal human being, They did so only for Dharma, Shri Sita finished herself in earth and Shri Rama in sun, There life is full of difficult situation and miraculous,

When we look in to their life they were both devoted to each other but when Shri Rama sacrifice Shri Sita she never spoke ill about him, she felt it was his duties to do so, with all easiness she took care and grow the two sons of Shri Rama Lav and Kush, they both showed us the qualities of disciple they showed how we have to dedicate to our guru, at very small age they knew the art of bow and arrow, also they knew Ramayana and other epics very well. This disciple principle is also situated within us and is devoted towards the mother principle, so much so they were even ready fight with Shri Rama only for their mother, for them their Mother was above everything and for Shri Sita brining up of her sons was her biggest duty.

Now a days we see that the wives when left by their husband kept on crying and will fight with the husband if comes back, they will fight when he is there or not there. If your husband leaves you alone never mind she needs to put all her strength in bringing up of her children, the women needs to have courage and strength like Shri Sita even when the husband is not there they don’t need to spoil their own lives and her children, bringing up of your children should be your goal to overcome such situation,

Shri Rama’s life was pure and Nirmal he left everything for his wife, when his wife was away he left all the comfort of life, he used to sleep on grass or on earth, use to walk bare feet, wearing dress like sadhus this is reality and just stories, we had many personalities whose life was an examples but never thought of such small details,

We Indians are  become hypocrite we believe in Shri Rama we just do his bhajans and it is over, In other countries they try of imbibe his qualities, they think how to improve themselves, we have in front of us an ideal but we cannot become like Shri Rama so we try to become like Shri Krishna when we cannot become like him we become somebody else and it goes on and we believe it, but if we have Shri Rama with in us we can bring his light in our attention, why can’t we achieve it ? All the yogis have to understand that we Indians have to imbibe the qualities of Shri Rama’s with in us, all our politics will be over,

All our problems will be solved we need to decide to become like Shri Ram, he took care of his people with desire less ( Niricha) and tried that everybody has to become dharmic , he always wished the development , that the people becomes knowledgeable  , imbibed all great qualities, that’s what he tried to do so and hence his life was an ideal for everybody, imagine if someone is giving you lessons but himself is not following the rules you will not have respect towards him, you just can have belief in someone  who doesn’t follow his own ideal you just can’t take his qualities in you, many people says that the follow Shri Rama, but I notice that they are just opposite of him, The Ram’s devotees are biggest thieves politicians or they 10 wives  how they can be like him.

We the sahaja yogis have our duties to bring the light of the deities in our attention, we need to see what Shri Rama did, if there were some difficulties how would Shri Sita reacted what she would have she sayed , if we start thinking like her all the women will be good gruhalaxmis, as you know Shri Sita took may forms one of them is of gruhalaxmi in the form of Shri Fatima, she was in the house covered in  chadar but she did all the dharmic works , for this you don’t need to go out and start giving lectures and become big leaders, this is not necessary , staying at home also you can do the dharmic work, take care of your children and the people around you and speak to them about sahaja yoga later on it can be in your surroundings, but before that you have to imbibe the qualities of Shri Sita within you.

In pure conduct first quality is love and affection, when Shri Sita was with her husband in jungle she never complaint about the her husband that he has no money ( normally which is seen in our society) he doesn’t buy things for me, instead she said If he live in jungle I will be with him, whatever he eats I will eat the same, She used feed her husband , her brother in law Lakshmana and then eat the food,

Today’s women think they get to much pressurised it is not true since they are like this mother earth which can absorb all the pressure and have all strength and give love and affection as like the mother earth gives us flowers and fruits. The god has given this strength with in us , women is form of Shakti, she is ocean of Shakti by support of it all the men does their work,

Women are potential energy and men are kinetic, if women try to copy men and start running like him she needs to stop since both the energies have their own works and both of them needs to be in equal, in both the works the role of women is important when time comes the women can be more productive than men,

In Maharsatra there was 17 year old widow called Tarabai who was Shivaj’s younger daughter in law, everybody lost their war with Aurganzeb but she won the war against him, at 17 year she died fighting this war you can understand when a women makes use of their strength she becomes intensive, instead of it if she starts using her energy in nonsense like fights, saying evil about others than she will loss her strength, she can do more fructive work than men but she needs to respect her strength than only her work becomes great and dignified,

Women needs be having the quality of shyness and wisdom, men utter bad words let them do it, don’t do it, when there is hot discussion men will start fighting , women don’t have to do that her work is to establish peace and safety, it is like a shield, the shield cannot do work of sword and vis versa which is important the one which can bear the sword or the sword ? it may happen that the sword breaks but the shield will never, the same way the women needs to use her strength and this strength has a hidden quality humbleness, in humbleness women need to imbibe the strength with in them this is not difficult for sahaja yogis, I see sometimes many yoginis do nonsense, they will talk too much to men, no need to talk too much with men and keep doing non sense, women needs to have complete knowledge of chakras as men try to know about it the women needs to do so all the knowledge of catches and all other knowledge.

To talk about men we have ideals of Shri Rama in our society, I think the muslims are amazing, I don’t want to speak wrong about them, in their countries it is not same, if you go to Riyadh they don’t look women with wrong eyes, they respect women, if women is crossing road they will stop and let her do so, they respect the women in our country I don’t know what is going wrong they feel women is relish good and always look at women event though the neck will have sprain because of it, to look at women with bad eyes is biggest sin and prohibited in sahaja yoga, absolutely prohibited. This will spoil your eyes spoil in sahaja yoga it is more dangerous if you continue you may become blind, your attention gets spoiled with the eyes wondering around, if your attention is not stable then what is use of self-realisation

If it is not stable you will lose your concentration, the concentrated attention only is useful, you need to obtain it, in foreign countries the men have this sickness more than women who have it also, all the western yogis understand that this is not good and when they came in Sahaja yoga they asked me mother please let us know the solution for this, I suggested them to look at ground don’t look above 3 feet’s, you can see good things at that level flowers, children, there is nothing looking above that, and thus you have to control your attention, if you have respect for Shri Rama you will control your attention like him, you have tell your wife you are Shakti and I respect you for it bit you need deserve it, like “Yatra narya pujayte tanta ramate devata” means where women is respected there resides god but she should be respectful, nobody will respect an bad women a rakashin, the women who is respectful should be respected and there will reside god, first of all we need to know that she is mother of our children, if the husband scolds his wife in front of children and says insulting words to her and don’t respect her than the children will not respect their mother, wife should not insult their husband neither, women and men thinks everybody should listen to me, if women know how to handle men there will be no fight believe me it is very easy since the men are like children, the men are innocent like children if you disturb them with nonsense things it won’t work, you need to forgive them like children, men goes out he fights with others, is facing troubles, if he doesn’t get upset with wife he will get upset with outside peoples and will get beaten , even he gets upset with you what is wrong? if you don’t have love and compassion for him there is no love and joy in couple,  the husband needs to look after the needs of his wife, he is thinking wrong than you should be able to tell her but no need to fight with small issues, this doesn’t suits to sahaja yogis I wonder how the sahaja yogi couples fight if they cannot leave in peace and I am telling whole world to stay together in peace. The husband should be complete aware of the needs of his wife and should keep in his mind all other women are like mother and sister for him. even after coming to sahaja yoga if men cannot do this he is of no use, according to our culture the relationship of men and women should be like brother and sister, but I notice sometimes it is not the case some women will start doing nonsense she will not sit with women but with men , there are some men of same kind they don’t have self-esteem and we say it as manliness, Shri Rama was purshottam if you believe in him don’t do nonsense follow his ideals, this must be reasons why the chlidrens are getting spoiled, women are getting spoiled but I will say due to indian culture women have taken care of many problems,

If it was American women they would have done all wrong, If men are married for 2-3 times he becomes bankrupt if women gets married for 2-3 times she will build a big house, what is there ?

The state of society ? children run away from homes, in India the speciality of women is she take cares of her house, she takes care of her children and her husband but this changing she is watching her husband is doing nonsense and running after 10 women than they think they run after 15 men and do the same nonsense, if he going in hell I will go before him,

The dharma flag is in the hand of women she has to take care of it and help her husband to follow the dharma, she has to look after her husband she needs to develop the bigger quality of dharma the forgiveness, she need to forgive the children husband and take care of all servants.

The work which I am doing Shri Rama, Shri Krishna and Jesus would have not done, Shri Rama would have kill you all if you are not following dharma and running after women, Shri Krishna would have send his sudarshan chakra on you and Jesus would have crucified you to avoid everyday crusification , I am being mother and the mothers love is so strong that she can overcomes all obstacle and help her children If things are not ok mother can sense it and she overlooks it and scold the children sometimes, the children knows that the mother loves them and she is saying everything for our benevolence, if father  gets angry or scold children normally reacts but not with mother because mother’s love has no expectations in return, she desires benevolence of  her children,

sometime some mothers have don’t good sense and will keep on talking without meaning and the poor husband cannot say anything than the children will get spoiled, such mothers can have children you are emotionally imbalanced and dangerous, women needs to stay back and let the men in front and help her husband from the background, the source of power of the husband is his wife. You have to understand that you need to be pure, need to work hard you may say mother is letting women do maximum yes because I know that women are powerful and they have bigger powers inside them,

just because I am mother everybody has let things on me to give you self-realisation , to cure you love everybody as any other incarnation has done this before, One Ahilya was realised from her curse did Shri Rama realised anybody else? Jesus had cured only 21 disciples, I would have around 21 thousands, travelled all world, do several things for different yogis but I don’t feel anything because I have power of love in me, this power of love is running before me , while going out I always think I should bandhan since I don’t what kind of people will come and catch my feet’s, but I forget and when such needy people are in front of me I suck all their problems, this love is such it make you doing things, I know it works with help of love although it is painful I don’t feel bad about it, only a mother can do it  hence I am expecting maximum from women and men should help women, understand them and respect them, if both the wheels of chariot are not on same level the chariot will not move forwards it will be on turning on the same place. We are right and left wheels of the chariot both have to do their respective works the right cannot do the work of left and vice versa.

Shri Ram did not think about husband wife relationship but all family relationship, he thought of children, brother sister mother and father, as it is to be done by any normal person, he look after his surrounding around him, the people his kingdom , he should how to fulfil his duties towards all, His was loving his wife too much still he sacrifice his wife to keep the goodwill towards his people and kingdom, nowadays husband do many wealth for their wife they will not help any poor nor any other needed relation, this is also problem with the political persons,

He sacrifice his wife she was pure and goddess herself, we have to understand he manage to get over the attachment, we get attached to my house my relation, mine mine ,

Before in western countries it was not going well between husband wives since they are in sahaja yoga wife has become everything for husband. At least 4-5 leaders are thrown out of sahaja because of their wives, because their wives were not ok, husband was good but wife was teaching husband and spoiling his head, I will tell that the wives need to understand what is sahaja yoga , what is her position, the husband doesn’t have to agree with his wife, he needs to tell her that’s she speaks a lot and has to take her care of here spoiled chakras this will help the wife to cure herself, in sahaja yoga we need to pay attention to our defaults and work to correct them.

We need to look towards the quality of Shri Hanumana how he helped Shri Rama in his work and served him, he knew that he had to keep himself in the service of Shri Rama, we need to take this quality in sahaja yoga it doesn’t mean that you bring food for me, not at all because I don’t eat and you are coming always with different food and put me in trouble, just think does Shri Hanumana was cooking food for Shri Rama ? Delhi yogis has troubled me lot now I have put a condition if you people are going to cook I am not coming anymore in Delhi, what is important you should do , it is useless to cook for someone who don’t eat and give it with force, if not you will bring things for me, believe me your mothers cupboard is full and I feed of this things, I am telling not to bring other things if you want please bring only flowers but not costly ones keep everything in balance just to please your mother, your mother is a simple lady , what to do with all these things ? so we need to take examples of Shri Hanumana how to do service, I don’t need any personal service, you serve Sahaja Yoga, if you serve sahaja yoga it will be my service, how many people you have self-realisation? As soon as some new seekers is coming in programme we start telling them there is bhoot inside you , we go so much after them that they stop coming to programme, Once I asked a gentlemen you were well established why you stop coming to programmes he said one yogi told him that he has 3 bhoots inside him , I asked why you believe this yogi? He said this yogi was someone important and was repeatedly saying you have 3 bhoots inside you,

Shree Mataji says I don’t who said it but this new seeker is gone.

So we have to learn from Shri Hanumana who believed to render his service to Shri Rama, we have to ask question ourselves what should be our work, my work is Sahaja yoga , my work is raising kundalini, giving self-realisation , bring peace , love in people, talk to everyone with love, explain people about chakras whatever is need explain them  it doesn’t mean you start giving lectures, speak for 2 hours , yogis like to give speeches they cannot leave microphone, this has become new sickness, so you have understand why you need to give such long speeches; there are so many talks of mother make them listen,

You show my videos to new people or make listen to my audio tapes and give pen and paper to write their problems and give them their self-realisation ask them to write down their problems and sickness. Here is only one man running around to clean everybody, you can all clear any one, all the men and women can work to cure people why one man has taken this responsibility, In London at least 15-20 yogis  can cure others, you should learn the techniques to cure others, you should take bandhan and cure people no need to invite yogis from outside to take care of it, you are moving around with the badges if you are not able to cure others remove these badges, if you cannot cure yourselves how will do it to others I have given you all the powers, learn how to cure people don’t ask other yogis to come to Calcutta to do this work, nothing is going to happen to you, no sickness can touch you the more you work in Sahaj yoga you will grow more, like the tree the more it will become round it will grow deeper,

There is difference between Sahaja yogis and other incarnations they did not a mass work, these powers were not given to anybody, Raja Janaka has given only realisation to Nachikta but you can give to many at same time, you have these powers, grow it cure yourselves and cure others, try to understand Sahaja Yoga, everything is within you, I don’t understand why your attention is not stable what are still searching ? you have to understood that Sahaja yoga is only blessings and nothing else you will never miss anything , but you have to do something for sahaja Yoga, even if you don’t do you will get the blessings, many are getting benefits like job health and other things for which you did not have to give up anything ,

I will tell for the freedom fight so many were tortured, my parents were send to jail, our house was sold , we had to stay in hut, we have to do much sacrifice, now we don’t have to do all these, you have to just benefit and get all the time the blessings, but you have to also give somethings, we need to keep both the doors open, keeping only one door is not useful, just put attention on what you have done good work, but there is fight who will become leader, you have to understand that these is all mother’s play, one day you will fall from there, you have not to pay attention to this specially women, everybody has to understand the leadership is just mothers play there is nothing important about your mother is testing how much ego business you can handle.

Nothing can hide in Sahaja yoga every things is exposed I say it or not it will be exposed, sometimes the leaders come to me and confess that they have some things wrong, the leaders have more responsibility to become more nice, sweet, humble and loving, and move forward taking everybody along with you, on this special day of Shri Rama we have to accept this, whatever he has done in his life we try to do the same and please our mother , he stayed so long in jungle eat whatever he got, wear simple cloths just to keep the promise to his father.

You don’t have to go to exile to obey my orders, neither you have to remain barefoot nor to starve, nothing to do such thing, everything is taken care in Sahaja Yoga but you have to know how to cure people you have to have complete knowledge of sahaja yoga, above all you have to know that Sahaja Yoga is love it is power of love which works everything which will take care of all, Sahaja yoga is not for one person not for anybody special not for one country but for the whole world, we have to just look how is our attention, it is said that if the attention is not stable we have to put control on it, you have to put the power of spirit in it, you have to do things with full concentration ( ekagraha)

The one who will do things with bhakti, with love will grow deeper or otherwise there is lot of garbage, you know what happens to garbage. If you are thinking that you are somebody special you are very fine you can do this and that, first try to understand that you have to be humble not towards only me but towards everybody, talk with humbleness and love, we have to  becomes like lotus and spread the essence of it,

If you all behave like this people will say about you that you are gentle like the Puroshotama Shri Rama, The bigger thing for me is that you are like Shri Rama temple for me , do puja to it take care of it  and keep with self-respect, you have full benefit of self-realisation and the same time you have to adore it and respect it and have devotion towards it, we are realised souls and it is possible for us all. We cannot do, it  is not impossible, believe me it is not correct to say so, you will see that all my blessings will be with you, everybody is calling me Rokhada Devi and you will see you will have the blessings immediately, you will to share with others,

Shri Rama used all his powers for well-being of mankind, you all become ideals for this world, you will be all surprised your own progress, there should not be no sickness inside you, change your habits , eat what is necessary, speak what is only necessary, introspect yourselves what I am doing ? Why I am doing so? Is it necessary? I am sahaja yogi, where is my mind going, stop ! by doing all this you will see that your kundalini will be very happy with you and will give lot of blessings, than you will say Mother what happened to me, when you come into it than you will know what it is, just work it out.

Today I said that Shri Rama was born at 12°clock hence the puja should be at time as such it is not long puja but we have to understand that the human form within us in form of humanity in which we understand and make changes in our mind, curiosity and thoughts.

Through the medium of Shri Rama can bring change in our thoughts, he can bring change in our behaviour because he is ideal for us, reaching this ideal we can reach other ideals since he is ideal of human being,

This is big thing that the god himself came on this earth and become ideal ,

We don’t leave our dharma “Vishwa Niramla Dharma “even if we have lot of difficulties.

May God Bless you.

Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi
