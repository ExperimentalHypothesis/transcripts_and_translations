I bow to all the seekers of truth.

One has to understand that truth is what it is, we cannot conceive it. We cannot organise it. We cannot order it. Only, as a scientific personality, we should have an open mind to see what it is. As we go to any university or any college, we try to find out what it is there, in the same way, when we have to find out about the truth, we have to be very open-minded.

But when we talk of ‘love’, we must know that love and truth are the same thing. There is no difference at all between God’s love and the truth itself. This difference exists when we are not one with God. For example, if you love someone, even on a very mundane level, if you love someone physically, also you can say, or in a carnal way, you know a lot about that person; you just know it. But when you know the truth, then you become the love. And the love I am telling you about is the love that is all-pervading, which acts, coordinates, and is the truth.

But, for this, we have to realise that we have not been at the level which we call as the absolute. We are living in a relative world. And relatively, when we start seeing things, it cannot be truth. Truth cannot be relative. It has to be absolute.

And in our evolutionary process, when we have become human beings, whatever we know, as truth...for example, if you know that I am wearing a sari, through your eyesight you know definitely that I am wearing a sari, which is the truth for you, is the truth for everyone. Everyone sees the same thing. So it relates to your central nervous system: that you must know it on your central nervous system – the truth. It cannot be any imagination. It cannot be any mental projection and it cannot be anything that cannot be proved.

So we have to prove Christ, His existence, we have to prove God, on our central nervous system. We have to prove that whatever Christ has said, is the truth. Unless and until we prove that, no amount of talking is going to convince the progeny.

Now the time is come for us to prove that. And that proof, whether you call it scientific or Divine, whatever it is to be, has to be expressed on our central nervous system. That means we must feel it, we must see it, it should happen.

Mohammed Sahib has said – they all have said the same thing, only depending on the times as they were – that, “At the time of resurrection, when the humanity will rise, their hands will speak.” He’s talked of resurrection most of the time, but somehow they never talk of it, only of the doomsday.

And this is the reason why, whatever was important in every religion, was not given the proper importance. That’s why, today, the situation is such that we find all of them in different compartments; but they are not. They were all born on one tree of life at different times. The same energy of love which nourished them. And [when] they flowered people plucked them saying, “This is mine!” “This is mine!” [And] put them into dogmas, into ideas, finished them completely. And then, now [what] we see is a quarrel going on.

So one must know that there must be something more we have to know. I would put it this way: that in the West, whatever knowledge we have had about science or about other things, is like the knowledge of the tree which is outside. Now, whatever Dr. Warren has told you is the knowledge of the roots.

Now supposing, if the East has learned this knowledge from you, has tried to understand the knowledge of science – of course, which is not very fruitful, also, but doesn’t matter – they have tried to learn this knowledge of science, why not we try to learn the knowledge of the roots? The roots of the tree of life. Why should we not try to find out what are the roots which are to be nourished, which were neglected, and that’s why we have problems?

These are the roots within us which are being described, and when these roots are understood, then only we will see that something more has to happen: that we have to feel those roots, [and] we don’t feel them on our central nervous system. We have no sensitivity at all within us.

For example, now, supposing a person is getting mad, he’s not conscious of it, that he’s getting mad. Or if he develops some disease, he doesn’t become conscious of it, till he gets some pain. But actually, these centres are the subtle energy centres, which give energy to the plexuses and look after us very well.

But how to enlighten these centres? That was the big problem: how to enlighten these centres, so that we start feeling our roots. For that, God Almighty, who is our Father, who is very kind and gentle in His all-care, has made this beautiful thing within us and all of them are like the milestones of our evolution.

These centres are to be enlightened and when they are to be enlightened, something has to be done. For that, in the triangular bone here, is placed the energy called the Kundalini. It’s a Sanskrit word meaning “the coils.” It is in three and one-half coils for a particular mathematical reason. A mathematician can understand [that] three and a half is a very important coefficient. [In] three and one-half coils it is placed there. And this has to be awakened, like a primule in a seed, to enlighten all these six centres, and ultimately enter through this centre (Sahasrara) which is the sixth one in this order because the seventh one lies down below the Kundalini. This is the important thing that has to happen to us: to become the Spirit, as Christ has told us that we have to become the Spirit, that we are to be born again.

By certifying ourselves that we are born again you do not become! Let us accept one thing: we are not going to live with myths and dishonesty. If we are going to be honest with ourselves it is beneficial to us. It is benevolent for us to be honest with ourselves and to realise that by giving ourselves certificates we do not become anything. It’s only a mental projection.

Whether I call myself a Christian or a Muslim or a Hindu, makes no difference whatsoever. Whatever dress I wear or howsoever I comb my hair makes no difference to me at all. In all honesty, we have to perceive and see.

To reach that absolute stage this Kundalini has to rise. There’s no other way out. And this is what is the Holy Ghost within us. This is the Holy Ghost, it the reflection of the Holy Ghost. And Holy Ghost is the energy of God, which is Love, which is His desire. His desire is the Holy Ghost, and is reflected within us as the Kundalini.

So the desire of God is that you should become the citizen of His Kingdom, that you should enter into His Kingdom and enjoy all the fruits of His blessings: understandingly, knowingly, on your central nervous system. This is his pure desire, and if that pure desire within us rises, then we see that all our desires were useless, and they are not pure, either. Because we have some desire, say, for example, we want to have a car: all right, have a car; then we want to have a house: have a house. They are never satisfied. In general, it is said that wants are not satiable because they are not [real] wants, they are artificial wants. The real want, the real desire, is this one: this energy of pure desire that says you have to unite, unite with the Divine, with the All-pervading Power of God. That is our pure desire, and unless and until that desire is completed, you may do any kind of things, you may go to all kinds of things, try anything: you can never achieve it.

Now, this is a living process because God is a living being. He is not empty words. He is not just something like a dead book. He’s not. He is a living God. He is a living energy and this is a living process, so it has to be spontaneous. It has to be spontaneous if it is living.

For example, there is a seed and you want to sprout it. Can you order it? Can you mentally say, “All right, it has now sprouted.”? Can you say that, “All right, I read these mantras to you, or Bible to you,” or do this? Will it rise? No, it won’t. It’s a living process. You have to place it in the Mother Earth [and] spontaneously it will rise. You don’t have to say anything. You don’t have to imagine anything. It will rise. And that’s what it is, that this Kundalini has to be awakened in the same manner, in the living process.

Now, many people are surprised that I don’t charge any money. How can you charge money for love, first of all? And this love, which is so spontaneous? I don’t do anything, I’m just standing before you, I’m doing nothing at all. But if that love is flowing all over and if you get this awakening because of my presence, I am doing nothing; it’s your own. Whatever is your own, this Kundalini is your own, your desire is your own: and if you achieve your Realisation, it’s your own. What is there to charge for? To be honest, I don’t do anything. There’s no obligation at all. It’s just the catalyst. Then you become the catalyst. Then the third person becomes the catalyst. Everybody can become the catalyst. But one has to be honest and truthful otherwise you cannot find truth. If you are living with myths, how can you find the truth?

Now the modern Sahaj Yoga, as I call it, whatever the way I am trying, is a little different than people could have used before. Like they first wanted to clear chakras, after chakras, everything, and then go to all kinds of penances and all that and raise the Kundalini – because people needed this cleansing.

Now, what I thought was the easiest method is somehow or other to raise the Kundalini, somehow, make it even a little glimpse of the light into people, let the light come in the lamp, let the lamp be seen by the people themselves.

When the Kundalini rises [and] there’s a flickering of the light, you can see [for] yourself what’s wrong with you, which chakra is catching, where is the problem, and then it’s very easy to correct. But if I say, “Do this!” and “Do that!” – finished! Either they will categorically destroy me, like Jesus, or they may [call me] a Hitler or something like that. Better is that, allow them to judge themselves, let them become their own guide, let them become their own gurus and find out. But how?

When the Kundalini rises by itself and pierces through, what happens is that your hands start speaking. You start feeling all around you the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost. You start feeling the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost coming out of your head also. Now, when I tell you what are these centres for, what will they denote on your fingertips and you start practicing it, you start seeing how it works out and then you realise it’s true. Then I say, now, supposing the Christ chakra is catching – this is the chakra of Christ. If I say that you might say, “How do you say, Mother, this is the chakra of Christ?” Because here you have to say Lord’s prayer. If you are catching on that, without saying the Lord’s prayer it won’t rise. But a person who is not a realised-soul, if he says a Lord’s prayer God doesn’t hear him at all. Supposing this (mic) is not connected, this doesn’t work.

You are to be connected to the mains. You are to be connected with Him. Once you are connected with Him, everything becomes alive and you can have a rapport [and] they can understand. Then you can say Lord’s Prayer [and] it works, it just works.

And another simple thing I have reduced it to [is] just if you say, “I pardon everyone. I forgive everyone.” It works ! Now, this is such a simple method. The other day I was surprised when I went to Spain. They said, “Mother, no, how can it be that simple?” And then another fellow told me that, “You see, Mother, we are confused, that we must suffer to achieve God. “

I said, ” Which religion are you to achieve?” He said, “Christianity. ” I said, “Impossible! It’s not Christianity. It’s the Jews who believed in that because they didn’t want to accept that Christ suffered for them. Are you Jews or Christians? First decide.” “Christians.” I said, “Then it’s wrong. How can you suffer when Christ has suffered for you? You don’t believe in His suffering.” Or did He not suffer sufficiently for you that you are still suffering?”

Then I challenged their ego a little bit, I’m sorry to say but I did. Because I thought they wouldn’t understand this. I said, “You said you are suffering. I don’t know of Spaniards suffering anywhere. If Columbus had not gone to America, we would have been finished in India, completely! You would not have had this. When did the Spaniards suffer? Let me know that. When did the Christians suffer as the non-Christians at the hands of Christians? What you tell me? I can’t understand.” It is not that.

It is something else you must know. That there’s no suffering needed at all. He is God Almighty who is the ocean of love, who is the ocean of grace and compassion. If an ordinary father won’t allow his son to suffer, how can that Great Father make you suffer? You challenge his love you challenge his compassion by saying you want to suffer. All right, you want to suffer, like Jews? [Then] have Hitler! You will have Hitler. You want to suffer, then suffer nicely! (laughter) Simple as that! You are not to suffer anymore. No suffering. You have to enter into the Kingdom of God. I have come here to give you the message of joy and message of happiness and eternal life. I have not come here to tell you about sufferings at all. And I don’t believe in it.

You suffer because of ego or superego.

There are two institutions within us which are built through our activity of the Left Side and Right Side.

Shri Mataji: I don’t know, Warren, did you tell them about left or right?

Warren: No.

No. So the Left Side is our desire of power. And the Right Side is our action power. And the result of our action power we collect here [as] our ego; and as result of our desire power, we collect superego, means conditioning. We have both things. One side is the superego, another side is the ego.

Now, when these two meet here (at Agnya), and join together and there’s a calcification on our fontanel bone area here then what happens [is] an I-ness develops within us and we become Mr. So, Mr. So and Mrs. So and all that. But when the Kundalini rises, here it is Christ the Lord, he sucks in these two. That’s why we say he died for our sins, for our karmas. It’s proved because he sucks in, he is the door here. He sucks in these two

institutions within us, where our conditioning and our so-called karmas are sucked in, and it opens out and the Kundalini rushes out.

You, yourself, can experience your own Kundalini coming out of your own head. I don’t have to certify you. The experience is your own. Everything is your own. I don’t have to say that you feel it, nothing of the kind: you feel it and then you feel on your fingertips.

Now here I feel that you must have pure intelligence. If it is biased, it’s already being spoiled by your own dogmas, your own ideologies and all that, you won’t see the truth easily.

I will give you an example [of] Dr. Worlikar or Dr. Warren. We have other doctors also, very well educated people and [also] very simple village people, extremely simple people. If you take the cross-section you can find people who are absolutely uneducated, you will find people who are very well educated, all kinds of people of all the walks of life. But, I have seen there’s one common point about them, is they have pure intelligence; that once see the light, they accept it and they work it out. This is the only point where I have seen people fail, and that’s how some people become Sahaj Yogis very fast and develop that state.

Now, this Dr. Warren must have given Realisation to thousands of people in Australia, you will be surprised. Then there are so many who have done this. But to establish you is your own value system. Realisation is not difficult, but to establish it you have to understand how to raise your Kundalini, how to establish it.

Some people take hardly three to four days and they establish it. Some people take a month at the most. But one has to get after it and respect your Realisation and love yourself first: that you are the instrument of God, and that [like] this instrument (microphone), as it is connected, you are to be connected with God. And if this connection is a little loose, you have to put it right – it’s your job. And if you learn that, it’s very easy for you. When an ordinary villager can do it, why not you? You will be amazed as soon as this happens.

We talk of peace. Those people who talk of peace...on the other side of it, as you know, I have another life also: they talk of peace, and the United Nations, this, that, big, big things. But [there’s] no peace within. Those who have no peace within, how can you talk of United Nations or anything on the basis of peace? You cannot, because it’s just mental and it will break in one moment as soon as something will happen of that kind, challenging your ego or superego.

So to get to the right point one must understand that, whatever human problems we have, are coming from inside, not from outside. You don’t worry about atomic bombs, they will not destroy us. The atomic bombs within us are going to destroy us. As you see, AIDS has come, this has come, that has come. They are going to destroy us and if you can just manage somehow or another to take this Kundalini there and establish it there, you will have no problem of any kind, no problem of any kind.

I have seen people who have been cured of cancer with Sahaj Yoga. Our [country’s] president was there and he was, [Neelam] Sanjiva Reddy – you may write to him and ask him – he got cured of cancer. And only ten minutes he took to get cured. You can get cured, even of AIDS, you’ll be surprised, if you take to Sahaj Yoga.

But whatever one may try, you see, it doesn’t go into heads of people who are much full of dogmas. They cannot believe that God can cure you! I don’t know, they have the photograph of Christ in their house, they have Bible in their hands. What did Christ do? Didn’t he have that energy to cure people?

Now this curing is not important, but as a by-product of this happening you get your physical curing, you get your mental curing, as a by-product. As a light comes in...see now, supposing I am holding onto a serpent in my hand and there is no light. In the darkness somebody says, “You are holding onto a serpent! Throw it away!” You won’t listen. But if there’s a little light, you see the serpent and you will just throw it away, “Oh, God!” That’s how people have got rid of their bad habits of drug addiction and all that, just like that. But I must tell you it’s so difficult to explain to modern people that there’s something much higher than all this!

We had very bad experiences, sometimes in England. Like the BBC people called me on the television and asked me to speak on that, but they said we can’t believe that you should do it without money. I said, “Why? How much will you pay me?” He said, “No! An Anglo-Saxon brain cannot understand anything without money.” I said, “Then an Anglo-Saxon brain cannot get Realisation! That is the equation.” How much Christ charged you? If you understand Christ at all, you must know that we sold him, and we are still selling him!

You cannot sell God, and you cannot sell all these things. That’s what they were surprised at. And they wouldn’t have me on the BBC. I said, “I will not say anything against BBC as such, but as far as my work is concerned, you cannot pay me.” How much will you pay me you just tell me? This is just love and just affection. Like Sid came and just said, “Hello,” to me: how much should I pay him for that?

Love doesn’t, cannot, charge. All right, for your hall, you can, for other things you can. This is one thing we cannot understand. And [when] I went to Toronto, I was surprised they asked me a question, “How many Rolls Royces do you have?” I said, “I don’t have any!” (Laughter). Then they are not interested in me, there’s no business about it!

Now, we have to understand that we are seekers of truth, and we are seekers of peace within, the silence within, the love within, and that power that gives you, empowers you to love others. Now, when we love others, our idea of love is either some sort of possession or maybe some greed or maybe some lust or something. But this love has nothing to do with that, it’s pure love. And the pure Divine love is such, like a sap in a tree, which rises and goes to all the parts of the tree, goes to the flower, goes to the fruit, goes to the leaves, and comes back. Supposing it gets entangled into one flower? The tree will die and the power will also die. It doesn’t get attached, but it nourishes. It [is] absolutely involved, but not attached.

All this discretion you develop when you have your vibrations and you are surprised that you start talking like a third person. Like we had one lady from India, she came down with me to Los Angeles and we had her son from Honolulu. She said, “Mother, give him Realisation!” I said, “I have tried, you give.” She said, “How can I? He’s not getting it.” So I said, “Then how can I?” Then I said, “All right, give him a certificate [that] he’s a realised-soul!” “How can I give him a false certificate, Mother?” I said, “That’s the point: he’s not getting Realisation. That’s the point! Accept the truth.” “So what should we do?” I said, “That’s a different point! But he is not getting Realisation! One must understand that.” So she said, “Yes, it’s true. It doesn’t go; it doesn’t work.” “It.” She didn’t say, “I have done” or “I do it.” “It doesn’t work.” You become a third person and you start talking in a third person language. As in Sanskrit, we call it as akarma: that your action becomes non-action.

You do not act anymore, but it becomes a non-action, a detached action. You just say, “It doesn’t work out. It doesn’t move. It doesn’t come out.” Or “It does.” So it’s something else that is doing it. Actually, you are raising the Kundalini, but you don’t say that.

And this power all of you have got. All of you have got this power. All of you should have it. Why should you hesitate not to have it, I just don’t understand? Supposing you belong to somebody, or some special dogmas or anything: that has not given you full satisfaction, that has given you nothing! So why not have this power which makes you absolutely dynamic?

Now, you know [what] my age is, I’m very old and I am a housewife. I’m a grandmother and I have so much things to be done on the other side of my married life and I travel so much; everything I do, I don’t feel tired at all. And you can become very magnetic and such a person becomes such a pure personality that even a glance of such a person can create peace, can give you joy, can lift you, can cure you, can do anything.

Such an ocean of power is within your reach and why shouldn’t we get it? It’s very simple. This is what, all of them have said it. It’s not that it was said only by Christ, but every one of them has said that you have to get your Realisation. It was thousands of years back when Rama came, even before that, we had many other people, they came. Then came Shri Krishna, then came Buddha, Mahavira: all of them said, “Get your Realisation.”

Buddha and Mahavira went to such an extent that they said, “Don’t talk of God. Don’t talk of incarnations. Just get your Realisation.”, only Self-realisation, nothing else. Because they thought that, when you start talking about God, they just slip off.

So, tell them, “You get your Realisation,” is the point and that’s what is important. So people called them anishwarwad (अनीश्वरवाद – atheist) – the ones who are atheists that don’t believe in God. They did believe in God, no doubt, but they didn’t want to talk about it, because they thought talking about God becomes a talk and a talk and a talk.

So, now the time has come to have the experience.

Unfortunately, Houston seems to be a little far away for my touring and all that, but in the whole world we have thousands and thousands of people who have got Realisation and are doing this work. Not necessarily that you have to give up your job. Nothing else to be given up. You are so dynamic. You don’t have to change your names and wear funny dresses. Nothing of the kind! (Laughter).

Some people think you have to develop some horns, you see. There’s no need to do all that nonsense. Wherever you are, it is an internal change that takes place. It becomes your own power. Only thing [is] the glow on the face is different; the glint in the eye is there. And such a person is a very loving, affectionate, and peaceful person; doesn’t get disturbed, no pressures of any kind, nothing of the kind. A very, I should say, contented person. A very contented person. All this is your own, just, just, this breakthrough has to take place and I am sure it will work out.

I think tomorrow we are going to have a workshop for all of you.

I don’t know, today do you want me to give them? Am I supposed to do the experiencing today?

Warren: I’m sure they’ll want to.

Shri Mataji: No, ask them!

Seekers: Yes!

Shri Mataji: Thank you. They will always say so. (Laughter)

Now we have imported at least twenty-five Sahaj Yogis across the border. And I must say that one day should come when we should export from Houston lots of Sahaj Yogis all over the world. That would be the best time, when I will enjoy my coming to Houston.

So, as I said it, truth, love and joy are one theme, because all of them are the quality of the Spirit.

Truth, you know on your attention. Whenever you pay your attention to someone, you know the truth about that person. You know truth about yourself, and you know the ultimate truth also: that you are the Spirit.

You are not this body. You are not this mind. You are the Spirit. This is the greatest truth. And that’s why it has to be established.

Once you become the truth, all the powers of the Spirit start manifesting automatically. Like a television, if you see, looks like a little box, but once connected, you see the dynamism of that. In the same way, this ultimate breakthrough has to take place.

May God bless you all.

At the end of it, I would like to thank you very much for arranging this programme. And giving me a chance to come and talk to all of them, and hope that next time when I come in September again, I may be able to come back. Because Houston, as I told you, on my way is a little bit far off, but doesn’t matter. We’ll have to work it out. If this time some people get Realisation, I’ll definitely come back here in September.

So, to begin with, as I said, first of all, we must love ourselves. We must forgive ourselves. We have to forgive ourselves and we have to respect ourselves.

We are human beings. God has made us from amoeba to this stage. We are not worthless people. In His eyes, we are worth all the heavens and all the universes because you are on the stage and you are going to fulfil His desire, because He wants all of you to be in His domain and His Kingdom.

So first of all, you have to forgive yourself and not to feel guilty at all. If you feel guilty, I will tell you what happens to you – it’s shocking. If you feel guilty, you develop this centre here, which is the Left Vishuddhi, as we call it. By developing that centre, you develop, from the very beginning, is the spondylitis. If you do not get spondylitis, then you develop a disease called angina. So please do not feel guilty at all.

Perhaps we have no idea what’s love and His compassion. Above all, He is the ocean of forgiveness – believe me! His forgiveness is so great that we cannot commit any such a mistake that He cannot forgive us. We have to just forgive ourselves. We should not judge ourselves also. By condemning ourselves we are not going to help ourselves at all. On the contrary, just see for yourself that if He is really the compassion, the source of all the compassion, the ocean of joy and love, then how can we have a little thing like guilt, because that will prevent your ascent.

Because in the West, it’s a fashion to be guilty. The language itself goes on, “I am sorry. I am this. I am afraid.” It starts like that. So the whole language itself is that, the whole mentality works that you should take all the blame yourself. “Oh this blame is mine, yes, it’s mine.”

So please, this is one thing: one should not feel guilty. Nor one should think that you have done this mistake and that mistake: that is one thing to begin with. And then it’s only about ten minutes job and you will get your ascent. And then you will do the same whatever I am doing here.

Now, first of all for this experience, we have to understand that all these centres are constructed on a physical level by the five elements, and the most important is the Mother element, this Mother Earth. So to take help from the Mother Earth, we have to take out our shoes and put our feet on the Mother Earth. She’s the most helpful thing and this triangular bone is constructed by her special attention. So just put both your feet on the ground at a parallel level.

Now you have to sit comfortably, not uncomfortably, but not with a lazy attitude, a little alert attitude; straight. Not pushing back your head too much or downward, but in a straight manner.

Now with both the feet like this – and you can even take off your glasses because you have to keep your eyes shut all the time. There’s no mesmerism on – and it helps your eyesight as well.

Now, these, both the hands, the represent: the left represents the power of desire and right represents the power of action. So we are going to use the left hand for desire to have our Realisation. So you place it comfortably on your lap towards myself or any way that you feel comfortable. If you think you can keep it on top of the arms of your chair, whichever way you like. And then the other right hand is to be used for helping your centres.

I will tell you how to raise your own Kundalini so you can do it at home also, and to raise it properly is very easy. And just now, you can raise it yourself it’s very simple.

First of all, I will ask you to put your hand on your heart. You need not close your eyes just now. I’ll show you the centres and you can just place it. Now, on the heart first then in the upper part of your stomach, abdomen. Then another one is on the lower part of your abdomen, on the left hand side.

All our movements are going to be on the left hand side.

Then we go back on the upper part of the stomach. Then we go back on the heart again. Then we go back on this centre, which I was telling you, between the corner, on the corner of the shoulder and the neck you can place this hand like this, and turn your head to your right so the hand goes back, quite back towards the spinal cord.

Then you raise this hand in such a manner that you press the forehead from both the sides, place your hand on the forehead, across; and, from both the sides of the hand you press it hard like that. You may bend you head, if you like.

Then you can put this right hand on the back of you head; not on the neck, but head, where the optic lobe is. And then press your head backwards, like this, push it upwards.

Then the last is that you have to set your hand and the centre of your palm, exactly the centre of your palm, has to go on the fontanel bone area, which was the soft bone in your childhood. Then you have to press it hard, stretching your fingers and press it hard, seven times move it slowly on your scalp. That’s all. That’s all you have to do. That’s all. It’s so simple as that.

All right. But one thing: please don’t open your eyes, because attention is to be drawn inside and if the eyes are opened, the attention goes out, you know that very well.

So just like this sari of mine, the Kundalini is coming up, so it pulls out the attention inside with the movement of the Kundalini. Everyone should try this. It’s very simple. Will help you immensely.

And then tomorrow, for the workshop, if you come, then we’ll establish it well and we’ll let you know what’s all to be done about it.

So now we place the left hand towards myself, [that’s] one thing, and the right hand on the heart and close our eyes. Just close our eyes.

Now, the left hand should be comfortably placed. There should be no discomfort anywhere. I mean, if you feel any discomfort anywhere, it’s tight or anything, you can release it so that you are comfortable, that’s very important. Because discomfort can take away your attention, that side. So better be comfortable, relaxed and sit in a straight manner.

Now please put your right hand on your heart. Now here resides the reflection of God Almighty that is the Spirit in the heart. In the human being it resides in heart. Though the seat of God Almighty is on top of your head over the fontanel bone area, but the reflection is in the heart, that’s why heart is so important. Here you have to say, or you have to ask a very fundamental question to me. You can call me Shri Mataji. If it is easier, you can call me Mother. “Mother, am I the Spirit?” Please ask this fundamental question in your heart three times. “Mother, am I the Spirit?” which is the truth, but you ask me the question please.

Don’t feel guilty. I can feel still there is [a] lot of guilt going on, so that we think, “How can we be Spirit?” All of you are the Spirit. You don’t know your greatness. You don’t know your glory.

Just say, “Mother, am I the Spirit?”

Put the left hand towards me and right hand on the heart. Only one hand on the heart, one hand towards me.

Now, take down the right hand on the left hand side, in the upper part of your abdomen, on the left hand side, and press it with your fingers. Now this is the centre of your mastery. If you are the Spirit, you are your master and you are your guide, as I told you.

Now here press it hard and ask a question, three times again, “Mother, am I my own master? Am I my own guide? Am I my own guru?” We are not going against all the great masters who are real masters, sat purushas, sat gurus; like the great incarnations; like the great prophets. All those great Divine people can make us our own guide. Three times please.

Now, you have to take down your hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. Now, this is a very important, very, very important centre. This centre is the centre which works out all the Divine techniques and Divine laws of which we are not aware so far. We do not know. When the disciples of Christ got their Realisation through the Holy Ghost, they got, they felt, the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost and they started talking in a different language. They didn’t speak in some language like Latin or Greek or anything, they spoke the language of the chakras. And they started moving their hands, so people thought they were mad.

But you will see now that all the Divine laws can be managed through your fingers if you get your Realisation, because your fingers become active and emit cool vibrations or cool breeze of the Holy Ghost. So there is nothing wrong in that, but those who were not realised people cannot understand that and that’s why they called them mad.

That’s not the situation today.

Now, please put your hand there on that centre which is called Swadishthana. And here you have to ask that you want to have the true knowledge, the pure knowledge of this technique. I cannot force on you anything because your freedom is to be respected. If you have to get the complete freedom it should be done on your own choice and your own freedom.

So here you have to just say, “Mother, may I please have the Divine, pure knowledge?”

Please ask six times because this centre, as you will know later has got six petals. Please ask, “Mother, can I have the pure knowledge of the Divine?” “Mother, may I have the true knowledge of the Divine?” Six times. Now six times you have to ask this.

As a result, Kundalini has started moving. So now, to enlarge the higher centres, and to give full confidence to the Kundalini, we have to put our right hand in the upper part of the abdomen on the left hand side and press it hard, and say here, will full confidence in yourself, “Mother, I am my own Master. Mother, I am my own guide.”

Please say it with full confidence. There’s no ego about it. With full confidence you must say so [that] the centre of your mastery will open out and the Kundalini can pass through well. It’s effortless. Only thing [is] we are helping the Kundalini to have Her own way upward.

This you have to say ten times, because there are ten petals to this. This is actually the ten commandments, which represent these ten petals. And there were ten

Satgurus in the past who came again and again on this earth, like Prophets: like Moses, like Abraham, like Lao Tse, like Socrates.

Please say this ten times.

Now please raise your right hand to your heart again, and press it hard. Here is your Spirit. Again, with full confidence, you have to see the greatest truth: “Mother, I am the Spirit.” Please say it ten times, “Mother, I am the Spirit.”

This you have to say twelve times, with full confidence. Twelve times, “Mother, I am the Spirit.”

Now please raise your right hand and put it on your shoulder, in the corner between the shoulder and your neck, on the left hand side and press it hard.

Turn your head to the right, so you can push back your hand now. Take it from the front side, don’t take the hand on the back, but just from the front side across. You can do it. And here you have to say, sixteen times, “Mother, I am not guilty at all” sixteen times. Turn your head to the right and say it sixteen times and even then, if you want to feel that you are guilty, or if you really believe that you are guilty, I think that you better punish yourself by saying it a hundred and eight times. (Laughter)

You should be pleasantly placed towards yourself, as I have been requesting you, to be pleasantly placed towards yourself. Not to condemn yourself all the time, to find fault with yourself and to say that you have done this mistake and that mistake – nothing of the kind. So just be very pleasant and happy about it and just say that, “Mother, I’m not guilty at all.” Please turn your head to the right, please, it would help you. Sixteen times.

It’s still terrible. Just go on, saying from the heart. Please say it from the heart. Still catching very much, I don’t know what I have said that you feel guilty. If I have said something like that forget about it. Forget about my lecture also. It’s too much sometimes with the guilt business.

Now, raise your hand, right hand, across your forehead. Press it on both the sides. Now here, from your heart, not how many times, from your heart, you have to say, “Mother, I forgive everyone,” from your heart.

Many of you may think that it’s difficult to forgive. But it is myth. Whether you forgive or you don’t forgive. Only thing [is], when you don’t forgive them, then you play into wrong hands. So please say it from your heart, “Mother, I forgive all of them. Every one of them.” And don’t try to remember whom to forgive, please, in general.

Now, that’s a nice happy mood, I think.

Now, please take your hand back, on the backside. And now I would request you not to be very serious about it, because if I say something you shouldn’t do it that seriously. It’s a very simple method.

So just push back your head and not here to feel at all to feel guilty. You have to say it once [and] for all, for your own satisfaction, that, “Oh Divine, if I have done anything wrong, please forgive me.” But don’t try to remember anything like that, what wrong you have done, or what harm you have done, nothing of the kind. Just push back your head for one minute.

Now, stretch your hand, stretch your hand, and put this hand in such a manner that the centre of your palm goes on the fontanel bone area which was a soft bone. Press it hard, stretching your fingers and move it seven times, slowly, slowly, in the clockwise manner. That’s all. Press your head. Press your scalp, hard.

(Shri Mataji blows into microphone).

Please take down your hand. Put it on the lap as the first [other] one.

You can now open your eyes, slowly. Now watch me without thinking. Just watch me without thinking.

This is the first state, called as ‘nirvichara samadhi’, where you are without thoughts.

Now put your right hands towards me, like this, slowly. Just right hand like this. And with the left hand try to see if you feel any cool breeze coming out of your head.

It can be quite high up also, with some people could be high up. All right?

Now put it, this one, towards me, like this, the left one. Now with the right hand just try to feel. You might get some hot, also coming; hot breeze coming out, because the heat might be coming out also. It doesn’t matter.

Now please keep this hand, now here you have to ask for your Realisation. I cannot force on you. So you have to put both the hands like this and say, “Mother, please may we have our Realisation? May I have my Realisation?”

Now, push back your both the hands like this, like that, and ask a question by pushing back your head towards the sky, asking a question:

“Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?” “Is this the All-pervading Power of God?” “Is this the Brahma Shakti?”

Ask three times any one of these questions.

Now please take down your hands. Now see for yourself: are you feeling anything in the hands or not? The cool breeze. Feeling it? Good.

It’s all over. Just you can feel it within yourself. It’s all over. Now you might think it is air conditioning: it has nothing to do [with that], because it acts. You see, many people first think it’s air conditioning. It acts, air conditioning cannot act. All right?

Today is a first day. In one day, how much one can explain? It’s a vast ocean of knowledge.

I must have given at least two thousand lectures in English language so far. And you can get all these tapes and everything here – they are in video tapes also – about everything. But experience is the most important thing. And to keep the experience on.

It’s very relaxing. It’s very peaceful. Now, I would like those who have felt the cool breeze from their head or in their hands to raise both their hands to see what the result is like?

Look at that! May God bless you! May God bless Houston! May God bless you! (Applause)

How about you? You got it? He got it? Great! Congratulations!

Now respect your Realisation. You can’t argue [about] it because you go beyond thought.

Tomorrow, I hope you will make it convenient to come for the workshop where we’ll answer all your questions, we’ll look after you, every one of you. And whatever is possible in these two days, we’ll try to work it out for you.

May God bless you.

Don’t feel guilty! Even now I am catching on that finger, so I would request you, you will catch on this finger if you feel guilty, all of you, so you might get a little burning here, so please don’t feel guilty. Be very happy and joyous. You must laugh it out now. You have found it! Like I went to Rome and the director of the national television was a very interesting man, and he said, “First give me Realisation, then only I’ll interview you. I said, “All right!” He got his Realisation and started laughing. He said, “How will I do the program? I feel like laughing all the time.” I said, “Better laugh! That’s the best way.”

So now, tomorrow I hope to see you all. Please make it convenient, please.

May God bless you.

So, thank you very much. I thank you very much. May God bless you!
