Shri Ganesha Puja. Rome (Italy), 19 May 1985.

But everything works out when manifesting our love. By thinking we only create complications as I did yesterday. Because also we decided something beforehand and I could not take any present from Ganesha. One should not decide such a thing. Because there were three Pujas only and if I take in two, if I don't take in the third one, I'll hurt Italians. 

So your Mother also changes everything, and you should be prepared to change also. Like I was telling him the example yesterday of only one Guru Puja we had, only one, in Bombay in India. See how lucky you are, only one Guru Puja there. And for that Guru Puja they bought a shawl for Me, a shawl. So I said, "Now, if you bought the shawl, then you don't give me sari. I won't take any sari because that will be too much to Me." And I absolutely I was sure I'll not take and I said, "No, no, no," until they know that no is ten times, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. But you see these deities are completely one with you people more than with Me. Because all the Sahaja Yogis were feeling very sorry that they had bought the sari. It was only one Guru Puja in India and I should have allowed. I said, "You must detach yourself when you are at Guru Puja. Don't worry our guest." But they would not. They were feeling all bad.

Then before Puja I went to wash my feet under a tap in India. You know how the taps are sometimes - at that height it was. And as soon as I opened the tap the whole thing, the water came on Me. I was completely drenched. So I came out completely drenched. I said, "All right, give me the sari." So because I don't want that you should be taxed for Puja, because some money has to be given because that's the part, but should be little part. So little part has to be given. That is important because you must learn to give in the sense that when you give little bit you get a lot, you see. It's another bribery corruption.

So I was telling Gregoire that "You should not tax people too much.  Let it be a small contribution." And deities in him miscalculated and he asked for fifteen pounds. And you'll be surprised. These fifteen pounds I've got in all kinds of money. I don't know what to do with it, but it is there. Out of this money I always buy something of silver for your Pujas because you can say that this belongs to Me. But you see, there is nothing wrong if I take away everything that you have. I know that. But I want to put a maryadas to everything, for you must also have maryadas, I am a maryaad, means I have no boundaries, but you must move with maryadas. I need not have any maryada whatsoever, and I don't have. What can I do? But I deliberately put these maryadas because you should have maryadas.

Because when you take an incarnation, you come in a maryadas. You come in an embodiment. And that's how one has to teach maryadas, boundaries, to human beings because they can always say, "What's wrong? If they are giving me, why not I'll take them?"  Anybody giving them anything, they will say, "Why not? I can exploit." Human beings are like that. So always an incarnation by His own maryada life, creates the maryada for them.

Now, as you know I like generosity very much. I like to be so-called generous because it's all your own.  If I give you anything, the joy is Mine. Now by giving only you understand how joyous you are. Otherwise there is no way out. So when I go to any other country but England âˆ' because in London I have no time for shopping âˆ' I go to shops. I leave my vibrations and everything there. Also I try to buy something which I can give away easily, in a good way, and something of course for my family which I have to run on other side. But then the things accumulate too much and even if you spend the whole night distributing, it doesn't finish. This time in India, the whole night we were distributing presents.  Nobody was tired, the givers neither the takers. And when we gave, all the Western Sahaja Yogis said, "Ha," as if they are getting it, you see, and then they would give to the Indian Sahaja Yogis everything. I tell you I have seen it. I sometimes overspend things, money and all that, in sort of trying to express Myself even when it comes to tours, but I am never running short of money. You see there is somebody sitting, Kubera, who is filling up my purse all the time. I never run short.

He is a very interesting guy for Adi Shakti as well as for you people. You just watch and see the whole thing. Don't get worried. Don't get upset. You'll see that the whole thing is so beautifully managed like a drama.

[Aside remarks: Are you all right now? I was told you were rather worried. I have to talk to you about it.  No, you are not worried, good.  I don't know if we can do the thing now because it's time to do the lunch, this time [UNCLEAR] Tell him do not worry, will let them have their lunch. My lunch is over. I am so full of joy and the Divine Love, and then we'll have the [unclear] Better finish. One hour eat. Are they hungry? It's a good idea [Mother speaks in Hindi] Where have you arranged? 

Sahaja Yogi: Not yet arranged, Shri Mataji. 

Shri Mataji:  Well, let them have that. 
 

Sahaja Yogi: Okay, Jeremy, okay, okay. It's okay. Leave it. We have lunch first. 

Shri Mataji: I mean it is [UNCLEAR] You are seeking.  Nothing should be binding.  You are seeking, nothing should be binding. Maryada is different but binding is different. Maryada is different.  Binding is different. 

Binding, see now I am in maryada, My body is in maryada, but if I tie it up then it's binding. Make it into a bandhi, and tell them. Bandhare, you say, bandhare? Bandhar?

There is a song in Marathi when about Rama when He was building the bridge for crossing over - Bandha re bandha re - yes, in Marathi Bandha re. Bandha re. Bandha re.

Translator:  What does it mean?

Shri Mataji: Means build up, build up and bandhara in India, Indian language means bandh is a...what you call that bandh - bandh, bandh...for the water to go, oh no, to stop the canal, bandhan, part bandhare, bandhare.  That's it, bandhare. Italians must have had some Maharashtrians here, I am sure. Otherwise, how can you say...

Sahaja Yogi:  Shri Mataji, can we offer the other presents?

Shri Mataji:  Just now. Had your lunch? Have backside, all right, have backside. All right.  Now....

Sahaja Yogi:  Just is this one.  We couldn't open for Your Puja, Shri Mataji.  It's from Alessandra. 
 
 
[Chanting: Ganesha Arthavasirsha, one hundred eight names of Mother, Devi Suktam (Ya devi sarvabhuteshu)]

[First fifteen minutes chanting of various mantras.
Married ladies were asked to offer sari to Shri Mataji.]

This is another Rutumbara Pragya.  This one, you won't believe, we got them for sixty-five pounds. Fifty-five pounds. In London, back in London, that too in London, another Rutumbara Pragya. This one you bring in this side. We'll another one on right side. All right, this one is [Unclear].  

This is another Rutumbara Pragya, under Ganesha Puja. Another Rutumbara Pragya works out. You don't see the saris and after all...all with the chakras.

This is also another Rutumbara. They wanted to buy eleven saris with the real gold, and these are very expensive saris. So I was hesitating about it very much, and we went to the shop to buy and they said the shop is burnt away and everything is stored up in another shop. So I told them whether these international saris should not be more than two thousand rupees at any cost. And they were also not very happy with the proposition. And it so happened, we went in that shop and we asked them, "Have you got saris with real silk?" So they took out one bundle. They had only eleven.  We needed eleven in a bundle of real ... and they cost us on the average sixteen hundred rupees only! That is how it was done so, exactly eleven and at sixty percent discount. Have you heard of such a thing? 

But later on, they all, in the shop recognized Me and they wanted to have Realization. And all of them got Realization. So much so that the Board of Handloom House wrote a nice letter to Me that "We'll always give you twenty percent discount." So in the marriages we all got twenty percent discount sari. So in buying this, how much money we have saved. Tremendous it was, really. The whole experience, the whole shop, all the laboring people, everybody came in the shop to get Realization. They also came to our Pujas and this and that and suddenly you got about thirty people there by these eleven saris. But when I wanted to buy for My daughter, I had to pay four times more because they are not Sahaja Yogis. So this is your luck.

Look at the quality! You see this combination.  And this is the one, the dress of Shri Ganesha, Pitambara. He wears the yellow, Pitambara He wears, yellow. How many of them are wearing today yellow, see? So there is no end to this miraculous happening. 

Now, unmarried girls, where are they?  They all should come now. You allow them to come. The poor boys don't do anything.

Devotional songs are sung.

[Aside remarks: See these mangal sutras the Italians have made themselves. are made by Italians. Good idea, these mangal sutras, like the Kundalini is the, a mangal sutra. You have to get some little Italian boy to put it. An unmarried boy? Boy, boy...]

Shri Mataji [on listening to Ganesha Mangalmurti Aarti]: Beautiful. You remembered by heart?  You are, you are remarkable, really!
