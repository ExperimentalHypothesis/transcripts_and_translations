Narrator: Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi - grandmother, scholar and freedom fighter. As a child she lived in Gandhiji’s ashram, as a student she studied medicine and as cry for freedom swept India she fought for her nation’s independence. The year 1970 was about her most important role. The discovery of development of Sahaja yoga, a movement which is now spreading in worldwide. Sahaja yoga is a science of integration which results in man’s mental, physical and spiritual wellbeing. The union of mind heart and spirit is a achieve through the working of a subtle energy system within each one of us.

Shri Mataji: “That you are not this body, this mind, these conditionings, this ego but we are the spirit. You don’t have to accept what I am saying blindly because blind faith leads to fanaticism. But as scientist you must keep your mind open and see for yourself what I am saying if it is so honestly you must accept it.”

Narrator: In today’s society this subtle energy system which has its origins in very roots of our being has been neglected. It is out of balance. Today’s physical and psychological diseases are gross expressions of a subtle system in dire need of repair and nourishment. Our collective desire of a peace and rejuvenation is a yearning coming from deep within. It is a reflection of our internal condition.

Shri Mataji: “We know so much though science about our civilization our advancement . This is a advancement of a tree which has grown outside very much but if we do not know our roots we will be destroyed. So it is important to know about our roots. "

Narrator: Within each individual the subtle energy system or subtle body is divided into 3 channels right, left and centre. The right side channel corresponds to right sympathetic chain of the autonomic nervous system and left hemisphere of the brain. While the left side connects to the right hemisphere of the brain and corresponds to the left sympathetic chain. If a person suffers a stroke in the right lobe of the brain it is commonly known that the left side of the body becomes effective. In line with the opinion of the psychologist Sahaja yoga identifies the right hemisphere of the brain has been responsible for the functions of the lateral, artistic, expressive thinking. Those functions traditionally believed to be more predominant in a females. The left hemisphere corresponds to functions of the linear, computational and mathematical logic traditionally considered to be predominant brain activity in males.

Dr. Carl Gustav Jung well known analytical psychologist identifies the left and right side as the anama and anami with the collective unconscious lying in the central channel. Through he studies he observe that in the every women there is a masculine aspect within her psyche the architect of the animus and for every men the feminine counterpart the anima. Jung was always aware of the imbalance in western culture in favour of the masculine seen in a preference for logic, analysis and external achievement. These are all claims for masculine side or right side of the psyche within all human beings. A right side channel also provides the energy needed for plan, act, analyze and predict. On the physical level it corresponds to liver and pancreas.

Shri Mataji: “This power of action moves on the right side of the spinal cord and coming to the optic chiasma it crosses over; passes to the left side and creates an institution called ego. The institution of ego is a myth. What we do is to get something dead like some trees dead so make some platform or some furniture, we take some stones and make a hall and we think we have done a great job. Actually what we have done is to reconstructed the dead. But while doing it we get the feeling that we have done it something. That is how our ego develops. This channel on the right hand side caters to your future. So those people who plan too much think too much, exhaust the energy of this centre because this centre has the first responsibility to convert the fat cells in the stomach for the use of the brain which is overused to make them into gray cells. So when you start thinking too much it has to work more for this very important function. When it starts working for one function the other functions are neglected and the other functions are it has to cater, to nourish or to give energy to your liver, to your pancreas, to your spleen, to your kidneys and part of your intestine.”

Narrator: Western medicine has followed the path of right side pulling a part dissecting or analyzing with little regard for the whole working mechanism of the human being.

Shri Mataji: “Of course when you neglect your liver you know liver as they say you will live till your liver will allow. Now this liver has to clean all the poison from your body. It comes out as heat and is delivered to the blood stream. But when this is neglected this poor liver doesn’t know how to function without the energy and all the heat is accumulated in the liver. So a person suffers from liver trouble and symptoms are he gets migraine, he cannot see the sun then also he gets very hot tempered, irritable, angry because there is so much of heat. Then this heat passes; I was telling in Canberra most of the Bureaucrats have this problem because they plan too much and where do we land with that planning oh God only knows. So then this heat passes upward and downward so when it passes downward it gives you a very bad problem of terrible constipation because the heat constitutes your intestine large intestines. It also coagulates your kidneys by which you have kidney trouble you cannot pass your urine. Then you go on the dialysis and you are certified as really dead. Because you cannot last longer. So very expensive treatment but doctors do not tell you frankly that oh, you are not going to live. Then this heat can pass upward and when it goes upward it goes say to your right heart as shown there. As a result of that you develop asthma. Of course asthma is connected also with the left side. So when this triggering is done by the left side then you get this horrible disease called asthma. Then this heat can go upward and can ruin your throat. It can freeze your right arm. It can make your left eye red and also your left ear deaf. But by chance if such a person is young and using too much physical energy and mental energy as well as drinking a lot he can have a very fatal heart attack very massive one and he may die in very early in age. You must know that all such attacks in young age always are fatal.

But when you see to the other side is that there is a pancreas which is neglected as a result of the neglect of the pancreas you develop a disease called diabetes. Even the mothers who are extremely planning type and thinking type give that disease to their children and children are born with diabetes. Then you have the third problem with the spleen. This is the most dangerous one. Now a days as the life is we are all time bound very particular about time. As a result of that we have become extremely hectic. Supposing if you sleep very late in a night then you have to get up early in the morning somehow. Somehow get into your clothes and run to the office. Don’t even take your breakfast; your wife will give you so on the way in the car you are eating your breakfast and then you read the newspaper. You get a shock of your life because so many horrible things are happening. Newspaper will never give something that is good or is doing well. But something that is gone wrong to give a sensational feeling. It’s just a sometimes horrible thing so early in the morning if you read something that is horrible being a human being then you sometimes shocked. Then you find there is a jam on the way and you get so upset and all your peace is disturbed.

Now this spleen is responsible for creating red blood corpuscles when you are in emergency. You must have seen when you eat your food and you run you get a pain here. That’s because your spleen is trying to pump out new RBC’s. Now to create that poor this spleen has to work very hard but it cannot understand the crazy hectic personality. Every time it tries to cope with it. It goes crazy. So such a spleen becomes crazy and ultimately leads some triggering on the left hand side; you develop a horrible disease called as leukemia or blood cancer. Then also your intestinal problems, the pain in stomach and all that indigestion all go hand in hand only because of the one centre only on right hand side. I have not even described the left side centre. So if I describe all this the whole Materia Medica will be described. It’s like that. So all the permutations and combinations of these centres give you physical problem then the left side gives you the mental problem.”

Narrator: Jung called the left side the collective subconscious. This side of our psyche is very complex and affects it can have on our physical wellbeing are devastating.

Dr Chugh: “Because as it has been hypothesized in Sahaja Yoga that there are 7 main plexuses and their functioning is dependent upon the individuals psycho social behaviour. This is advancement in the understanding of psychosomatic medicine and human physiology. For the first time it is possible to find the links between the behaviour and the disease. Because up till now it was only thought that stress can cause a variety of diseases from diabetes, hypertension, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, etc, cancer even. But it was not known why a particular individual will get a particular disease.”

Dr Rhi: “If you read disease in medical literature you find you could say that it is psychological stress which is responsible for increasing incidence of hypertension in most of the western countries, developing countries as well as the developed countries and we found by our first thesis you see on which work was done that this could be a very important if a person practices Sahaja yoga this stress factor can be managed very nicely. Because all the parameters you see for testing whether a person is in a state of stress, tension or anxiety are in his relaxed strain who are done and that we found that a person who do Sahaja yoga only for 20 minutes a day you see in about 3-4 months time that there were changes in the blood, there were changes in heart, there were changes in the lactrine cyclograph, there were changes in the muscle activity and the changes in the neurotransmitter.”

Dr Chugh: “In the essential hypertension group we have taken 25 female patients of a similar age group and socioeconomic status and out of these 15 patients voluntarily consented to practice Sahaja yoga while 10 patients acted as controls and these patients initially both the groups were on drugs also. The initial blood pressure in the Sahaja yoga group was 169/109 mm of mercury and in the control group it was 166/111 mm of mercury and as the study progressed for four months we observed that many of the patients gradually could be taken of the antihypertense of medication and at the end of 4 months all the patients in the Sahaja yoga group could be taken of the antihypertense of medication and the blood pressure had reached the level of 135/83 mm of mercury. While the control group blood pressure remained at 167/111 mm of mercury and this shows that it is possible to treat this condition essential hypertension by practice of Sahaja yoga and without taking medicines.”

Dr Valentine: “In my hospital I began to hold use Sahaja yoga treatment on children and it so nice to see how it’s possible to resolve many questions, many problems for instance child 7 years and he had big liver 1 cm and lot of problems with joints and doctors could not make correctly diagnose. But when I feel what chakras were affected. It was most Swadishthan, Nabhi and Agnya and after first my cleaning liver decreased 4 cm and everyday more one cm and after 10 days he was absolutely well. He had lot of neurological problem like teak like neurotic reaction and when he came back father couldn’t recognize him. He sit quietly without problem. But of course you can’t introduce Sahaja yoga only in children, mother has to be very very with the children and the same and its useful in other disease or for reference I worked in department of intensive care and recepation. Sometimes I rise kundalini and severe attack of bronchial asthma disappear and many other cases. Now I began to with one group of Sahaja yoga in hospital, doctors, nurses and other people during about 2 months we began to start probably hospital and it gives effect. I am so happy that I stay in Sahaja yoga and everyday thanks Shri Mataji. Jai Shri Mataji.”

Narrator: Western medicine has enhanced the quality of our life enormously and enables us to experience hillo to unknown heights in medical efficiency. But in doing so it has lost sight of the whole. By contrast medical doctrines such as traditional Chinese medicine approach the human being as a whole personality the emotional stability, mental attitude spiritual requirement and also sense morality are considered in a traditional Chinese process of medical treatment. As a result traditional Chinese medicine treatment has a subtlety which western medicine lacks. With this realization we have tried to translate Chinese medicines into western culture and into western contexts but in doing so the foundation has largely been lost. The focus in western medicine remains set up on the element and not upon a whole person or his subtle relationship with the universe. Like Jung’s anima and animus the yin and yang represents the masculine or feminine or right or left side of our psyche. The yang being masculine active right side and yin being the feminine passive side. Viewed in a light of Sahaja yoga we can see how this parallel is the subtle system. In Sahaja yoga Tao refers to the balancing of right and left side. When this balance is maintained the healing energy is able to travel on the central channel to integrate and nourish all the energy centres and ultimately keep us in harmony with the balance of nature.

Shri Mataji: “As we have two sides in our system of autonomous nervous system left and right which we call as left and right sympathetic nervous system. The left side caters for our emotions, for our past, our desires. The right side caters for our action physical and mental. If we indulge into one too much and go too far with it you develop an imbalance within yourself. In the centre lies the third power which we call as parasympathetic nervous system. This is channel which is the central path of ascent. When the kundalini rises through it, it brings you in the balance because it rises in the centre of the system. So this is a minimum that happens that you develop your balance.”

Narrator: The ascent which is the awakening of this feminine energy coiled and sleeping in our sacrum bone nourishes and revives the subtle system. She is like the Mother Earth or our own Mother soothing, nourishing and sustained the powers of gentle and strong. She is the kundalini the very root of our existence. Within her lies the potential for us to become complete in knowledge of ourselves.

Shri Mataji: “All right what I tried to show them that this is the left side this is the right side. This is the left sympathetic nervous system and same this is the right sympathetic nervous system and really spinal cord looks like this and inside here is the spinal cord which has the centres in it. The subtle centres. Now when you start using the energy of these centres say too much on the right and it starts moving more towards the right and there is a constriction and the power becomes less because you are exhausted going more towards the right side. Suddenly something happens that from left there is a jerk then the connection is completely broken. This is on its own. It starts working on its own that’s we say that this has become malignant and no relationship with the whole to have the proportionate growth. So if the nose starts developing it can cover your eyes and cover your mouth everything. This is how a cancer is set in or any other disease so many psychosomatic disease are nothing but somatic is from right side and when the psyche gives in then it becomes a psychosomatic. There are so many diseases which are more psychosomatic than the physical and these we call them as incurable can be easily cured by kundalini awakening because when kundalini passes through this she just integrates them for example she going like this then she goes into this integrates them. Just like she strings them like pearls and so they are brought round and also she nourishes that centre that’s how people get cured automatically by themselves by their own power.”

Narrator: Again if we look at traditional Indian medicine the purpose of Ayurvedic medicine was to integrate the mental, physical and spiritual wellbeing of patient. The identification of three points of reference bile, phlegm and wind corresponds in Sahaja yoga to the manifestation of right, left and central channels respectively.

Dr Chugh: “As you know that health is normally that is not diseased but it is the state of complete mental, physical, emotional, spiritual and social wellbeing. Now this spiritual aspect of health has been missed in modern medicine. It is not known, taught or practised in modern medicine. This word kundalini does not find mention in the modern medical textbooks but it was mentioned in and may mentioned Indian medical textbooks of Ayurveda and many other religious textbooks religious scriptures.”

Shri Mataji: “There is a subtle power which is all pervading of God’s love which manifests all the thing like living work, all nourishment all balancing. It’s so balanced. If the pacific was slightly deeper than this; there would have been problems. If Himalaya was say one and half times than what it is there would have been problems. So everything is so balanced in nature...Which is the subtle energy all around us which organizes us and which nourishes us, does all the living work and above all it loves us”

Narrator: Sahaja Yoga takes us back to this original desire and in practice fulfils it in addressing of spiritual needs of the human being Sahaja yoga has potential to bring balance back into west and back into western medicine. The essence of Sahaja yoga though is not to cure people. This is a side effect of the subtle system bring itself into balance. As it's core Sahaja yoga enables us to discover our true selves the purpose of our being, the true meaning of why we are here.

Shri Mataji: “The reason is you have to now become the spirit go beyond your physical, emotional, mental being and become the spirit. Because spirit is the reflection of God all mighty and spirit is the universal being within you. When you become the spirit you become a universal being.”
