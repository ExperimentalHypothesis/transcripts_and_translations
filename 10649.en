b'\nEvening Program before Sahastrara Puja Day 1, Cabella Ligure, May 5th 2000\n\n[The evening program is concluded by a santoor concert by Bhajan Sopori. During the concert Shri Mataji says\xe2\x80\x9dWah\xe2\x80\x9d. At the end of the concert: \xe2\x80\x9cWah wah\xe2\x80\x9d.]\n\n(Shri Mataji speaks first in Hindi: \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6Sukhwinder\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d)\n\nIt is really a very memorable program we had, as was told before, and I\xe2\x80\x99m amazed how it has all been done so well.\n\nThe idea of calling Bhajan Sopori was very much appreciated in the beginning. And I thought santoor is the best instrument for Sahastrara. Because it has got so many strings to play, just like our Sahastrara is made of one thousand petals. So the \xe2\x80\x93 it was very apt that we could invite these two great musicians.\n\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to praise them, because is really so much beautiful way of rendering was there, that we all got lost into the ocean of joy.\n\nIt was very, very beautiful, and from all of you I thank them very much from My heart, that they should really develop this art and this kind of creativity much more, and come to us again and again - will be a much better promise for us on this auspicious day.\n\nNow, you see, one has to know that Indian music is a very deep subject, it\xe2\x80\x99s - only can be understood by people who have depth in them. And I was surprised that the people who went to Babamama\xe2\x80\x99s Academy, in three months they started singing ragas like Malkauns.\n\nSo I think sahaja yogis have a special aptitude to pick up Indian music. And the way they learnt it, when people spend years together.\n\nAnd I was very much surprised how it worked that way, and the way you all are enjoying shows that it is the music of the heart, music of the Spirit. And that\xe2\x80\x99s why, even if you do not have education in that, still you were all enjoying it very much.\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99m very much thankful to them that they came and played so well, with a full heart in it.\n\nAll of us are very much thankful for all that, and I hope they\xe2\x80\x99ll come again and again and oblige us with their great \xe2\x80\x93 grand music.\n\nIt is not only thankfulness, but the way it entered into our awareness, our attention, is a remarkable thing.\n\nAnd that everybody \xe2\x80\x93 so many of you are here - have enjoyed it thoroughly, is something shows the oneness, the collectivity of enjoying music.\n\nIs that\xe2\x80\x99s a sign of real ascent, and a real \xe2\x80\x93 I would say - advanced state of Self-realization, that you all could, from very different, different countries, different languages, different styles of music, all of you have enjoyed the music, that was really universal.\n\nSo I\xe2\x80\x99m very much thankful to them and I bless them from My heart, that they will develop more love for us and come down again sometime, whenever we call them.\n\nThis is \xe2\x80\x93 this will be a great blessing to all of us.\n\nSo, may God bless you all.\n\nThank you very much.\n\n(Applause)\n'
