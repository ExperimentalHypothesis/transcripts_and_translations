Here we're going to do what we do. See this one is an area which we can reserve for an agricultural development for the villagers for their training and all that, this one. For local people, for the local people, for other people also for their for their understanding of good agriculture and all that that we can have. This is a big area. We can even have a small type of animal husbandry to teach these people yeah but the main thing is the 22 acres of land we are going to have all the foreigners put there on the 22 acres of land that side we are going to have. This organisation where we'll be teaching people how to learn Indian craft. You see all these, all kinds of crafts, crafts, arts and crafts, as well as music. So that's the place we are going to have a little far away from the madding craft. See, here they will be taught how to look after their agriculture and improvement, everything. So that centre will be here and at Nga we are going to have the small scale industries.

Very picturesque over here, very beautiful. So this is my guys. Look at you. So good. On the opposite side is that when you take 2 acres. That's where the the foreigners are going to stay here. They're going to occupy this area and establish arts and craft, centres where they can learn such crafts as goldsmiths, silversmiths, and so on. They're going to learn art. And they're going to learn Indian music. This is the whole purpose of mother establishing a centre for us to come from abroad to learn these eternal crafts here in India.

It's a very peaceful place. It's a very beautiful place and in in the monsoon season, this whole rivers awash with water. It's very, very beautiful. The land is quite rich here too, but unfortunately, the village itself is very poverty stricken and that's going to be transformed by the yoga. I You can see the barren barrenness of the river now. Wait till you see it in flood time. OK. And you should see the other. It's better to have this because once we develop it, then you will be able to show the difference between what we have done.
