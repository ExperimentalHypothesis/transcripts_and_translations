Gavin: Here we are going to do what Shri Mataji?
Shri Mataji: See, this one is an area which we can reserve for an agricultural development for the villagers, you see, for their training and all that, this one.
Sahaja Yogi: For local people.
Gavin: For the local people, for other people also, for their - you can say, for their understanding of good agriculture, you see, and all that, that we can have. This is a big area. We can even have a small type of animal husbandry, husbandry at the site, to teach these people here. But the main thing is, on the twenty-two acres of land, we are going to have all the foreigners put there. On the twenty-two acres of land, that side, we are going to have this organization where we'll be teaching people how to learn Indian craft, you see, all this, all kinds of crafts.
Gavin: Arts.
Shri Mataji: Arts and crafts, as well as music, you see.
Gavin: Wonderful.
Shri Mataji: So that's the place where we are going to have you, a little far away from the madding crowd.
You see here, they will be taught how to look after their agriculture.
Gavin:: And improvement.
Shri Mataji: Improvement, everything, so that center will be here. And at Nangaon, we are going to have the small-scale industries.

Gavin: Very picturesque over here.
Shri Mataji: Very picturesque.
Gavin: Very beautiful.
Shri Mataji: So this is my ideas.

Sahaja Yogi: That's where the foreigners...
Gavin: The foreigners are going to stay here. They are going to occupy this area and establish arts and crafts, centres where they can learn such crafts as goldsmiths, silversmiths and so on. They are going to learn art and they are going to learn Indian music. This is the whole purpose of Mother establishing a centre for us, to come from abroad, to learn these eternal crafts in India. It's a very peaceful place. It's a very beautiful place. And in the monsoon season, this whole river is washed with water. It's very, very beautiful. The land is quite rich here too. But unfortunately, the village itself is very poverty stricken, and that's going to be transformed by Sahaja Yoga. You can see the barrenness of the river now. Wait till you see it in flood time.

Shri Mataji: That money can be used for this and that one. So, that how the money is generated. [Hindi] And you should see the other land also.
[Cut in the video.]

Shri Mataji: It's better to have this, because once we develop it, then you will be able to show the difference between what we have done.
