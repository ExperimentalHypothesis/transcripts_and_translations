Speech on Christmas Eve, Pune (India), 24 December 1982.

Before we start, the celebrations of the birth of Christ, we have to little bit review what we have done after His Birth, so that we understand where we stand in relation to Him. For He was the Son of a Virgin so that even the slightest blot on His name should not be created. Because He was to do the greatest job, of creating for us Agnya awareness, which would help us to suck in all our sins, all our conditionings, and all our egos. And the great personality was created for such a great work within ourselves. But unfortunately, we have spoilt both these institutions within us to such an extent that it is the ‘most’ difficult task to give realisation to Christians.

On the one side we have too much conditioning, as you know, through catholicism and other ideas about Christianity which created a ‘horrible conditioning in our super ego, which is just like a solid rock, I think, sometimes. And those who have been to catholic churches are still, get stuck up with it. Even as they are facing me, I find their eyes are blinking and the Agnya is not straight.

You have to give up all that conditioning ‘completely’ if we have to ‘really’ get to Sahaja Yoga. To that extent we went, that we tried to create institutions – of course, we collected money, no doubt about it, lot of money – all kinds of drama, of the Papal Order and of Arch Bishop Order and all these Arch Bishops and all tomfoolery. All kinds of nonsensical donkey people were created. ‘Absolutely.’ They have nothing to do with the Christ, they have nothing to do with GOD, they have no idea of Divine Life. And to them prohibiting people from doing something was fully religion. And his has taken the West into such darkness that Sahaja Yoga has to be worked out in a very great speed and in a very expansive way, otherwise you cannot get over these horrible ideas of Arch Bishops, and the Bishops and the Popes.

The other side is the Ego part. Then people like Mr. Freud came in and they put ‘absolutely’ anti-God ideas into people, ‘absolutely anti-God.’ It is against the Mother, against the Son, ‘Absolutely, it is absurd.’ These anti-God devilish ideas penetrated and people started saying, “what’s wrong? This is all conditioning, we should remove all conditioning,” so they became ego-oriented, which is the other side which Christ had to work out. So I mean, after Christ has been established in the West, they have seen to it that they create ‘all’ hurdles that are possible under the Sun, for the Agnya Chakra to open out.

Despite that, I find that all Sahaja yogis who are from the West are still attached to ‘Christianity’ and not to Christ. There is a lingering Christianity still within you, and the Christianity has to drop out. While Indians are very good at dropping out all non-sensical ideas. Because we have had lots of challenges in this country for every thing. For the conditioning, we have had challenges, for the ego oriented, we have had challenges. So people are used to this kind of a giving-up. But in the West, we still are very much attached to that non-sense of Christianity. It has nothing to do with Christ, believe me, and this fanaticism which is lingering still in your mind must be given-up, otherwise you do not do ‘any’ justice to Christ. That by no chance means that you take to another religion like Hinduism or any non-sensical Jainism, or any thing.

The ‘essence, the ‘Tattwa’ of Christianity is Christ. And it is ‘so’ thickly clouded by all these non-sensical things that you ‘really’ have to drop out this word ‘Christianity’ from your vocabulary completely, and from your mind, otherwise you can ‘never’ go to the essence. It is a fact, take it from me.

And even now the attention of all the people is on what Christ said, or Mother Mary has said it, and which has come through these horrible people to us. So to learn about other deities and other great Incarnations, we neutralise. We must try to neutralise too much attention by learning about other deities, say, Shri Ganesha.

If you talk about Shri Ganesha, he is the essence of Christ. You understand it. Ganesha is the essence of Christ, and Christ is the manifestation of Shri Ganesha’s powers. So, if you go to the essence, of most things, you see, that is better. Then of course, Christ is there but we must see in Him, as He is, which ‘very few’ people have seen before, but now in Sahaja Yoga you ‘should’ see Him as He was. He was the Holiest of Holy, first of all. You accept that position. Then this Freud nonsense has nothing to do. Those who call themselves Christians: five days they do all nonsensical of Freud and sixth day they talk of Christianity, and seventh day they go to Church. How can they go? I mean, how can they call themselves Christians -  by what standard? Just tell me. I mean, just think of it. And the Indians have asked them to get out because they won’t understand what it is. ‘So’ nonsensical, it is filth. The Holiest of the Holy, we have brought Him down to such a low level by our nonsensical ideas.

So one has to understand that these conditionings of Catholicism made us so repulsive to ourselves that we took to the other side which is even worse, much worse than the conditioning. And you come in contact with these people morning till evening. Either they are Freudian or they are so-called Christian; even after realisation.

But you must know you are special people. You are above them, you’ve risen above them. Christ is awakened.

So to do justice to Christ, you must get over all your conditionings, to begin with, of Christianity, if you have any, or if you have been Freudian get rid of that horrible fellow, absolutely, he was anti-Christ. Sick, sick, sick. We have nothing to do with Freud’s ideas, even this much. Believe me. We have not to justify him at any point for any thing.

He took full advantage of the repulsion people developed out of the conditionings. And then he built up all these stories, because he was himself a very low level man, not to be counted as a human being from any standard. You see, Christ came for human beings, but not for these low level people. Even the lepers were better than him, I think. Horrible! Even to think about the whole thing makes me nauseate. It is very unholy. So, for all practical purposes, we have to understand that we have nothing to do with Mr. Freud. He is filth, he is dirt. He is absolutely low level man. We have nothing to learn from him, nor from his ideas.

Now, the other side of it is the conditioning of the church. There are still many Sahaja yogis, still confused with it. Of course, if you have to save the Christians, so-called, you have to take them out of the conditioning. Luckily, we have someone who is writing a thesis about these things, how these things are dangerous to society.

But still nobody realises this is anti-Christ activity; to condition. It is a anti-Christ activity. Christ came on this earth where Moses has laid down the dharma. After it, so many. He thought people will be in balance and He has to give the message of His resurrection and ascent. That is how He came on earth. But then they created even worse things than the Shariat; Shariat is in the Bible. All these laws are in the Bible where they say that anybody who does this thing should be killed, anybody who does like that should be beheaded. It is all in the Bible. You see, whatever these Muslims are doing is all in the Bible. Coming from Bible. So, to neutralise all that Mr. Freud started another style.

For us divine laws are binding because we know that is the only way one can rise. It is not compulsion, but voluntary acceptance that we have to rise, that we have to be alright, there are no conditionings in Sahaja Yoga but this is how we improve. This is how we go further, so we accept the situation, and we move forward with it. That is why realisation should give you that strength to fight anti-Christ activity within your mind. You have to face yourself, is the point I am saying. Not only that you have to face yourself, but you have to face the so-called society that is around, and see for yourself that these conditionings and these anti-Christ activities into which you have indulged are completely detrimental to your growth, and to your ascent. And as you are special people who have got realisation, you have to argue it out with yourself and reach proper conclusions. No use arguing out with others.

As you know with the conditioning, people get quiet, they do not talk, but the conditioning is growing inside. With the ego people talk too much and they aggress others with their talking and the ego is growing too much. So one has to be in the witness state, that means wherever you have to talk, you have to talk and wherever you have to keep quiet, you have to keep quiet. This is at the Vishuddhi level. At the Agnya level, you have to detest all that is ugly, all that is unholy, all that is filth. Because now a new sensitivity has developed within you. And a new sensitivity to Holiness, to auspiciousness. Try to improve this auspiciousness within you. I find people get very easily attached to negative people. They get identified with negative people, very common. And they think that they are being sympathetic. It is the sympathy they are working.

It could be your sister, could be your brother, mother or could be your wife, your child. It can be anybody. But by getting attached to such people, you are really harming that person because that person will go down to hell, and you will also go down to hell. So if you want to do any good to the person, best thing is not to be attached to that person and tell that person that these are anti-Christ activities; and get attached to that group which is doing holy work and understand that the strength lies in getting attached to that group than getting attached to one some single-out negative personality.

Now, everyone of you has had some experience, I give you the example of ….’s wife, she is not here neither he is here. But it is nice to understand what happened in her case. He was very attached to her. He married her. He asked me. I was really shocked that he so insensitive, why can’t he see her, why can’t he understand her? But I did not know what to say.

If I say do not marry, he will think that Mother is trying to force him down or something, I did know what to say, but I was really shocked and for about two minutes, I did not say anything. I am sure she played her cards very well. And I said: “Alright, you can marry. You will get happiness, if you think, you get happiness, that is all.” I did not say ‘joy’. If you think you can get happiness, marry. Now she got married to him. Then he said she must come with him to England. He brought her. I tried to avoid. I told him “Be careful.” Then they lost their passports. He found his passport, she did not. But he got after my life; he said please ask Mr. Shrivastava; somehow get her passport. Passport should be there. I said alright. Then they made her passport. Then she came with me. Still she was continuing.

I told that “please send away this lady, I do not want her to be with me. It is a headache, all the 24 hours she is with me. I must have some time without these horrible bhoots around me. Please get rid of her, she is bad.” But he could not understand I Still he was siding with her. Then one day it happened that she attacked my heart. The heart got into a big fist. I said now you put hand on my heart and see. It’s throbbing like anything. He could not put his hand. Could not even bring it near it. I said now please ask her to get down. When she got down, it stopped. Then he realised this is the thing, but still he did not give her up, did not give her up

I went to Los Angeles, everywhere she followed me. The sympathy, you see, she could have gone away, she was quite a robust lady.

But in Los Angeles, then she started showing her teeth to him, gradually. And then ultimately he got into trouble, he started getting the pains, but as soon as I left Los Angeles, she got her epilepsy. And he realised how dangerous it was to carry her all the time with me. Now he cannot send her away because she has epilepsy. He did not take her back. She tried to disrupt all the Ashram by telling them her sympathy stories – “Oooh I you know my husband, he wants to leave me,” this, that, non-sense; and all of them fell for her.

Now, she is a bhoot, and a bhoot, and a bhoot. And the bhoot started increasing. One more bhoot added sympathy to other, one more bhoot added once you’ve given sympathy, one more bhoot added. And she was creating problems, “you see that, this is not good, he is not good, he is against me, this family is against me, that is against me.” Then someone got heart attack, got heart attack. So then he sent her away.

Now you do not repeat all that non-sense. Negativity is not to be tolerated, not to be carried on with, discretion is better part of balance. One need not be afraid, but discretion is better part of balance. All right? If you have negativity, better get rid of it. if somebody is so negative, better have nothing to do with that person, whatever may be the relationship, just have nothing to do. Because no use going down, if you are a seeker; you are a responsible seeker and a Sahaja yogi; one has to be careful.

This is on a Christmas day I have to say because there only the fight starts – at the Agnya Chakra. Because if you shift from the principle of Christ you start giving arguments in support of the negativity. Always: in the opposite direction, alright?

And you have all the arguments which work against Christ. The same Agnya Chakra when it goes funny, you start seeing things very reasonable which are absolutely false and wrong. So we have to be alert. We have to be with Christ. Now, they will say also about getting vibrations: “Mother, alright. I am also very much there. True, we saw the vibrations.” Nothing doing I feel embarrassed. Sometimes I do not tell, I feel embarrassed.

And people also try to manoeuvre me by playing tricks on me so that I am rather worried, sometimes, how to tell people. Because I have seen ego-oriented people are extremely sensitive. Now they are not arrogant, one thing is there, but they are extremely sensitive and if you tell them anything they will not accept. Like yesterday, I lashed all the Poona people, they said it was for our good. Nobody said that “Mother why did you say such and such thing?” No, Not one. Everybody said it was for our good. But in the West if you lash them, then you will be lashed. Nobody is going to take it that way.

So I have to tell you one thing to have your ego problems settled, first of all see, that you are not playing to your ego. And also, see your conditioning which are now bhoots, all these conditionings have become bhoots in you. All the Church bhoots have got into your heads. They are all there. So you must see that these bhoots are not there, because we have to be holy. We have to be clean. We have to be resurrected. We are resurrected people. Christ has resurrected us. But you have to think how much he has to work for us. The more you try to be in unison with negativity, we harm him more, we torture him more, we trouble him more. The one who was born in the manger in the most difficult circumstances, where everybody requires comfort, who from the very beginning went through hazardous life till His death. His birth itself, you can see, was in a cow-shed. None of you are born in a cow-shed. And while the Christians are so particular about comforts, most surprising is, why Christ was born in a cow-shed? In a very very cold night Christ was born. Nothing much to cover: sparkling beauty it was.

Now we have to keep him within ourselves comfortably. We are not going to give Him that manger in our Agnya Chakra. Manger of thoughts and a crown of thought – that we are not going to give Him. We are going to make Him comfortable by not accepting negativity as a sympathy. You have to be kind towards your auspiciousness and holiness so that Christ enjoys His stay there in your Agnya. That we do not torture Him by our useless ideas, uncomfortable behaviours, inauspicious appearances and unholy acceptance of wrong ideas.

Try to respect Him; there He stands. Try to make Him very comfortable. I wish I could do that, but He resides in everybody’s Agnya Chakra. If He was only in my Agnya, I would have given Him the greatest comforts, but he wants to be manifested in everybody’s Agnya.

So I have to request you as a Mother to look after Him, give Him a nice cradle, give Him a comfortable time, because He is born to give you your resurrection. He has taken up such a great responsibility to suck all your conditioning and to suck all your ego, but that does not mean that you put stones on top of it.

It’s like, sometimes I find the conditioning of some of the people in the West is so great, that a big mountain is falling on this little child. And sometimes I find a big a bad breath. Horrible breath of ego, it stinks, blowing like a big wind towards the Agnya, horrible stink coming out of this terrible type of a ego.

Absolutely not the way to treat the King of Kings who is born within you. You are so respected that Christ is born within your Agnya. But you must respect your Agnya Chakra.

Your attention should be in the centre so that no wobbliness – imagine put a child-like they say, a child is to put on the wings. So this Agnya Chakra is to be kept very clean, healthy and holy. The attention should be holy. The attention outside is still not very holy, should be detached attention. If you start seeing through your Agnya it should project a power of holiness so that anybody who looks at your eyes should know that serenity is flowing from these eyes, and not lust and greed and aggression. All this we can achieve because we have got Christ within our Agnya. Accept Him there. He is born, yet to grow. I am sure Sahaja yogis will understand the importance of the Agnya Chakra.

In the East, no problem, because to them He is only Ganesha. Ganesha is a child and they know for definite that childhood has no contamination, no problems, nothing. So they are still children as far as sin is concerned. There is a story – one pastor went to a village, and gave a big lecture to them, and the villagers had to thank. So he got up and he said, “Thank you very much for telling us all about it, we did not know what was sin and thank God you have told us that there is sin!” So this awareness is not in their heads. They do not understand. You will be surprised, you cannot ask Indians. They won’t understand what it means, you know. They may say Mr. Freud, this, that; but they do not understand, it is so anti-God. Actually I did not know till the other day, when Rustom told me with great hesitation what it means really. So that is what it is and we have to understand this.

Today is the great day of holiness. Let us celebrate the birth of Christ in our Agnya Chakra and let us sing praise of it so that He in His pure essence, in his holy body, He should be there, not Christianity and neither Freudian non-sense. Christianity is equally bad as Freudian. There is no difference at all. Whether you kill the child with the mountains falling on him or with a horrible stinking, dirty-smelling breeze blowing on him, it is just the same.

So please get rid of both the ideas – absolutely. And in purity you respect him. Absolutely purity because He is purity. Now you may say that Mother if He is pure purity – there are some stupid people who ask me – “if He is purity, then how can we make him impure?” What I mean, if you do not respect Him, why will He be there? He will disappear. He likes purity. He will disappear from there – it is not good for you.

So better create a cradle, a beautiful cradle, of love, of honesty, as His Mother prepared for Him. With all sweetness and kindness and assurance that you will nurture the beauty and the auspiciousness of Christ.

May God bless you all.

Any questions you have, ask me.

S.y.: When I am in thoughtless awareness, I can’t see clearly. 

S.M.: I think you must be seeing more than what you seen normally!

He is correct. When you are thoughtlessly aware your eyes, you see, - the pupils start dialating, it’s correct. But take it higher – the Kundalini – slightly higher, push it up. Alright?

If Kundalini is staying at thoughtless awareness means just dilating and the eyes can become black, but there’s no sparkle. But when it comes out, then you find a sparkle in the eyes. There is a difference in the eyes, if you see. The eyes get dialated – when the Agnya Chakra is being just penetrated, that is still here it is. Then you can’t see clearly. Correct. But at thoughtless awareness is all this part (Agnya and above) So if you push it up a little higher – you know how to push Kundalini with your attention – or you watch here (Sahasrara), or you think of me; Kundalini will go up. Alright?

So thoughtless awareness is just the beginning. And it’s a great area, up to Shri Krishna point where you become the witness. Now the witness point when you’ve become, then there is a sparkle in your eyes. Your eyes sparkle. Sparkle in the eyes is a sign that the Kundalini is flowing well. That time you see more than you see normally. And in the start, it starts looking bigger, everything starts looking much clearer. Alright?

Dilatation of the pupil takes place. Some people really at that time have opened their eyes and they said “Oh I We’ve become blind.” That’s true, it happens. It’s correct. Alright? Good question….

Agnya is very important and best way is to take your Kundalini up. You see, don’t roam about in Agnya. Very dangerous. [You can be thrown as he said on the 4, 4, 4 foot back or you can go this side 6, 6, 6, 6. It works out 6, 6, 6, 6 this side and 4, 4, 4, 4 this side]. Dangerous. Never go. You see you should be very careful. You should never roam about in Agnya because you’re thrown out. The attention is thrown out – projected. You start thinking; all problematic.

Try to take your Kundalini out all the time. See, that it’s coming out. Put your attention there – and the best is now put your attention to me I Because I am at Sahasrara.

Don’t allow your Kundalini to remain in Agnya part. It’s dangerous. No doubt. You have become subtler and you can start moving left and right if you want to, and if you try to.

I’ll tell you. If you start closing your eyes; say, you’re sleepy and you start seeing images at that time. That means you are going on to the left side – they’re dead bodies, you start seeing their faces, this, that – you are going to the left side. Now supposing you start seeing lights and stars and this and that – all sorts of things -  I mean more the colours, we should say; you are moving on the right hand side, so try to avoid it. ‘I don’t want it,’ you should say. And you try to put your Agnya – if it is left, you put it to your right side or if it is right – just by pushing it.

But what happens, that after sometime, when you’ve achieved a certain state, of higher consciousness, then if you want you can penetrate into these areas. You can see all these things. But then certain different types of things you see, for example, you might see from my Sahasrara huge, big ‘Valayas’ coming out, or something like that. That’s a different point altogether. And also sometimes you might see a little – say, a flame –that’s a good sign, that means somebody is guiding you. But you’ve to be careful. Not to indulge into these things because there is a guidance for you and you’re all followed by great deities, no doubt, but you should not try to, sort of, hanker after that. If they are there, let it be. Because, you see, your Agnya is very important. You should not allow your Agnya to be attracted by these things. You might just find a flame, like that. Sometime you might just find a little dot: standing dot. They are all actually angels who are with you and try to assure you. But that’s not important. What is important is, on your way, you should go further and do not go this side or that side. But if you are seeing everyday those images, then try to push it back or this way, whichever way it is and try to finish them so that you go further. That means you are sticking on to the same point or you’re moving in the other direction on the sides. Because direction should be further and further and further.

Sy: How should we protect our subconscious since we cannot be conscious about it?

S.M.: You need not. I mean, you don’t have to worry! Just keep to the conscious. Alright? You don’t protect anything, actually you don’t do anything! Actually, if you see; what do you do?

Sy: I just enjoy.

S.M.: Yes, just enjoy. That’s the best part. Just enjoy! I want you to enjoy. Don’t create problems for yourself that’s all, and just enjoy. Alright? Just don’t create problems for yourself.

Don’t be ambitious. Don’t be aggressive. And don’t be – submissive too much to others. That’s rarely so. But be submissive to Sahaja Yoga, be surrendered to Sahaja Yoga.
