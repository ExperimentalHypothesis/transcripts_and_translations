I bow to all the seekers of truth, at the very [UNCLEAR] we have to know the truth is what it is. We cannot change it. We cannot describe it. It is, it has been and it will be. Only thing is that we can feel it on our central nervous system, when you become the spirit. It has been said in all the scriptures that you are to be born again, that you have to become a wali and [UNCLEAR] in the Quran. Kundalini is God’s ascent. My father has translated Quran in Hindi and sometimes [UNCLEAR] there are many misinterpretation in every religion. Because any religion if it becomes money oriented or power oriented, it loses its power. But all religions are spirit oriented.

You had a great leader Ataturk, Mustafa Kemal Pasha who was a realized soul. And I read his life [UNCLEAR] twelve years, I gated mad. But people don’t understand him sometimes. For all saints and Sufis who were real Sufis, it is very difficult to explain what they are enjoying. We had a saint in India Kabir, he was Muslim. And He said how am I to explain everybody is blind. And this blindness is there because there is general ignorance. This ignorance can be removed through this Kundalini awakening.

Now the truth is that you are not this body, this mind, this [UNCLEAR, intellect], ego, conditioning. But you are pure spirit. And the second truth is that there is a all-pervading power of divine love. This is calling ruh. So you have to reconnected with that. Unless and until you have this connection you cannot understand yourself. These centres about you, they have told you where created during evolutionary process within us.

God Almighty is the greatest creator. And the way he had created us delicately, we have to understand that only thing we have to go to the last stage. Surprisingly in Turkey there has been so many Sufis. Sufi word comes from saf. Saf means clean. That is my name also. So how do we become saf. We have [UNCLEAR, physical] problems, emotional problems, we have social problems, political problem, all kind of problems. Now these problems come to you, because there are problems in your centres. But when the kundalini rises she passes through these centres.

This kundalini is your own mother, your own individual mother. She has been with you in ages. But people did not know about it. Greece maybe [UNCLEAR, know], of course I will say. And this work was done in India also for very few people. So in these modern times it is already predicted. That there will be a mass realization on [UNCLEAR, you]. For this you can’t pay. This is your own power. It is potential. We use our brain very fractional also our heart. But after this happening you know about these centres.

All the problems of the world mostly come from human being. And the problems of human beings come from these centres. Somehow you can put these centres into proper shape, life could be different. Now these problems which we think are great and global are nothing.

People ask me about peace. Now we have about 65 nations who are practising Sahaja Yoga. Especially Russia, they have never heard about even God. But there are some [UNCLEAR] something like that. They are very intelligent and like a clean seat.

I am surprise that in democratic countries, it has been [UNCLEAR] demonocracy. For example when I go to America my husband says you [UNCLEAR] everything, no ornaments, nothing. Can you imagine, the greatest democracy full of violence? And it is western culture I have seen it through and through. Same in England, the parents kill their own children. 75% children who are still, who died because the parents. Can you believe this? I don’t know, how they can call themselves higher races. Higher races do not take the killings. To me that very stupid also.

Now take out this Elizabeth Lady, she married eight times, very inauspicious. And then she married a boy who is 20 years younger than her. And 4.000 people go to watch her going for honeymoon. And there are helicopters, ten helicopters covering round to take her photograph and some of them [UNCLEAR] down to take the photograph. They fall on people and on trees. Indians maybe poorer but much wiser, you won’t buy one Indian [UNCLEAR] this nonsense.

If you see the extreme is stupid thing have reached, you will be amaze even their music now they are saying it is up to brain cells. In my own other life which I met many people many [UNCLEAR] sophisticate.  And what they talk among themselves is nonsense. They talk about drugs, ladies, try this drug, it is very cheap now in bargain.

And I have to warn you, don’t take to their stupid culture. Now at least you are, I think 10, 20 years behind. Because now the women are looking nude and men are also looking nude in the advance countries. And their all market are [UNCLEAR] and down like that. They have lost their jobs, they have lost their [UNCLEAR]. They have big mess. They have no shame, nothing. And they have no idea of in moral life. Without morality a society is finished.

They followed this stupid Freud. When I told them against him they never agree with me very much. Now they are known. That Freud, [UNCLEAR] Freud, one book I have read. And another one was Down Fall of Freudian Emperor. The base of Freudian principle is that you have bad relation with your own mother. Thank God it is [UNCLEAR] to India. Otherwise they would [UNCLEAR].

We can’t stand this nonsense. There is no wisdom in saint, such horrible thing and then do you believe to this. As you say pak, they are not pak, pure, absolutely. And if they combine together, if I they are collective, they take to something horrible. They take to alcohol, drugs, [UNCLEAR] Michael Jackson business, I mean.

So what I feel that Turkish must stand back and see what is happening in this mad world. I was surprised that you also import food for your country, I mean Indians won’t do that. What I knew about Turkish people, they are very patriot that what I knew. You come back your [UNCLEAR, wrong] first of all by through Sahaja Yoga you will.

You will have self-knowledge by which you will be self-confident. You will have peace in your heart so you will be peaceful people and enjoying the blessing of your spirit. With the light of the Spirit you can feel your own centres on your fingertips.  You can feel the centres of others on your fingertips. Whatever race you are, whatever country you are, you become a universal being.  Sitting down here you can feel anybody vibrations, because your computer is connected with this all-pervading power. Which thinks, understands, cooperates, coordinates. It is very efficient. Above all it loves. It is compassion. It forgives you, looks after every moment. Thus you enter into the kingdom of God. Whatever is written about cennet it is a fact. And that is what you feel you enjoy.

If you are that, if you are so much empowered within yourself why not get to it. They say that this what about this guru, what about that one why [UNCLEAR]. You become your own guru, your own master. Because we don’t take money they are very much against us [UNCLEAR].

It is your right to have this. And once you get it, you will be amazed at yourself. Supposing you are an artist, you become a much greater artist. You must have heard the name of “Hamzat Ali” from India and also we have many people who play tabla “[UNCLEAR]” and all these people.

They are all Sahaja Yogis. And after Sahaja Yoga only they became so famous.

Many diseases are cured by Sahaja Yoga, many diseases, without penny. Diagnosis you don’t have to go through the [UNCLEAR] of diagnosis and doctors. Your own power cures you.

Now in India there are 3, I think now 4 doctors who have got their MD after [UNCLEAR] in Sahaja Yoga. Definitely cancer has been cured in Sahaja Yoga, so many diseases, because these chakras are the fundamentals of our being. If you know how to correct them you get cured. And you can cure. You can help others.

Now our attention which is all the time wobbly like this. It becomes innocent. And whenever such a person puts the attention it cures. It gives peace, it gives joy. You don’t have to give up anything. Not to become a sanyasi or something [UNCLEAR]. Whatever will not suit you do yourself give up.

I give an example like I am holding a snake in my hand and I am very obstinate. So if somebody says and  I am in darkness. Somebody says there is a snake in your hand; I say no, it is a rope. Till that snake bites me, I will say it is a rope, but as soon as I see some light, I though away, because than you realize what is destructive for you and what is constructive for you. It every way it helps. We have some hippies to begin with, now they are very rich people. So the financial problems also can solve. Many people say we worship God, we do this, we used to do so much Namaz still we are pure. Or some of them say that we are doing all kind of immoral things and we go to the mosque what is the use. We cannot control ourselves. But after realization you really become rightest. Nobody has to tell you, automatically become like this. But you must have desire, pure desire to be a Sahaja Yogi [UNCLEAR].

Sahaj means born with you. Yogi means the one who has connection with the Divine. Than you can amaze how many powers you have. You can raise the kundalini of others. You can give them realization. You can, I mean so many things happen to them. I am surprised how many talents they have. They always say Mother you have done it, no, no, no it is your own mother, your own Kundalini.

Now there are so many things that happen to you. That people started writing to me what miracles they have seen. So I sent them to very intelligent Sahaja Yogi that you better write them down. Within one month he telephone to me, the miracles have come up this much. I don’t know [UNCLEAR] which one to write.

Than you realize there is God. Otherwise whether you believe in God, not believe in God is blindness. People will say how to say there is God, you cannot prove but we can do. Above all you start swimming in the ocean of joy. You develop your balance, your satisfactions and you just enjoy yourself.  You are full of energy see I am 70 years of age, I don’t think anybody [UNCLEAR]can go like myself. It is so relax, no strain, no stress, nothing.

Joy is singular. It is not happiness and unhappiness. And your ego is pampered when you feel happy. When it is puncture you feel unhappy. But joy you enjoy everything. You enjoy also stupid people, mad people and [UNCLEAR] Divine, and then self-respect, self-confidence which is compassion, extremely compassion, at the same time dynamic. That is what you are and why not become.

In one small lecture I don’t know how much I can do it. Only in English language I must have done 4 - 5.000 lectures only. But also this is all mental acrobat like you have a sign this is this hotel. But you have to enter inside. No use just reading, those who just one reading morning till evening have reached nowhere. It is to follow what it is and you have to enter in, which is very simple. Especially with Muslims are I have seen it works very [UNCLEAR] well. In the Bazar we gave realization to someone. Only thing you have to have pure desire. Arzu we also say, so many words are like Indian language here. So now we say, we have to come to the sahil.

We have had a lots of problems, but there is solution, believe me, so [UNCLEAR] we could have the session.

Now there is one thing I have to tell you that I cannot force on you spirituality. You have to ask from your heart. You can take out your shoes, if you don’t mind, it helps a lot. It is very simple.

I must say there are three conditions.

The first one is that you should not feel guilty for anything. Because I find people, [UNCLEAR] God how will I get it, because I have done this sin, that sin. There is no sin for you. So please forgive yourself fully, because in modern life it is a fashion. I mean if we have done anything wrong, that is the past. You should face it. But don’t carry it with you. So the past is past, finished. The future doesn’t exist. What is reality is present. When we are thinking, we are thinking about the past or about the future. What about present. If present you don’t have any thoughts and that is the time when spirituality moves.

So the second condition is that you have to forgive everyone. Don’t have to think about it, that is a headache. Whether you forgive or don’t forgive, what do you do? But when you don’t forgive then you play in wrong hand and you torture yourself for nothing at all. So it is a myth. And the one who has troubled you nicely [UNCLEAR, happy] and on his behalf you are torturing yourself. So please give up that myth. And I say even don’t think about it. These two conditions are very important.

If you feel guilty then you catch here, on this centre, left side. This catch gives you spondylitis, angina. And thirdly it is very important that it should open, because the kundalini has to pass through it. So please don’t condemn yourself for anything, please don’t feel guilty. If you had done anything wrong, you could have been in jail or how could it be?  So now don’t feel guilty. I think it is [UNCLEAR, rather] please don’t feel guilty. I can feel it you all [UNCLEAR] Because of that you feeling sick also for nothing at all.

Now the third condition is that you should be all absolutely confident that you will get your self-realization. Just be fully confident.

Now what we are going to do is to nourish our centres, our own centres which we will show you how we do it. First you see [UNCLEAR]. So first we put the left hands towards me, like this. It is just like Namaz, I am telling you, put left hand toward me. Now this is the symbolic that you want your realization, because this is the power of desire. Now so that’s why because this the left side is the power of desire and the right side is the power of action. We keep both the feet apart. You can keep comfortably on your lap [UNCLEAR].   It is working everywhere. Now we use the right hand to nourish our centres. Unfortunately this is an air condition now. And when you start feeling the cool breeze of this all-pervading power, people doubt also. I think better to [UNCLEAR,close].

Now first we put our hand on our heart. So in the heart is the reflection of God Allah as [UNCLEAR, spirit]. Now when you became the spirit, in the light of spirit, you know your will.

So you know that you are your master. So you on the left side, upper portion of your abdomen, this is the centre of your mastery, mastery as a saint.

Then we go down into the lower portion of our abdomen, in the left hand side. Now this is the centre. No this side, all we are working on left side. This is the centre of pure knowledge, knowledge about the laws of the Divine.

Then again we take our hand on the upper portion of our abdomen on the left hand side. This is the centre as I told you of your mastery. This has created by great [UNCLEAR] also every kind of religion, masters.

Then you take it on your heart where resides the Spirit.

Then you take it in the corner of your neck and your shoulder and turn your head your right. I have already told you about this centre. You catch it when you feel guilty even now it is there.

Alright, now you take your right hand across on forehead like this. Here you have to forgive everyone in general without thinking of [UNCLEAR, it]. Please put down your head.

Now you have to take your right hand on the backside of your head and push back your head as far as possible. Now, at this centre push back. Without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes just for your satisfaction, you have to ask forgiveness from this Divine power.

Now stretch your hand fully, the palm, this is the last centre. So you put the centre of your palm on top of your head. Now push back your fingers, very important and please put down your head. Now move your skull seven times, slowly clockwise, push back your fingers. Look push it not to just move hand but push your skull. That’s all you have to do.

Now, please again put your feet apart. Put your hand like this as we do for Namaz. And put your right hand on your heart. And now close your eyes. You should take out your spectacles because it will help your eyes [UNCLEAR]. I have to ask you to ask me a question about yourself. It is a very fundamental question. You can call me Mother or you can call me Shri Mataji whatever you like.

So in your heart ask question three times, “Mother, am I the Spirit?” Ask this question three times. I have already told you that when you become the spirit, you become your guide, your master.

So now please take your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen, on the left hand side. Here you ask very fundamental question, “Mother, am I my own master?” three times. I have to tell you that I cannot force Divine knowledge on you. You have to ask for it.

So now please take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen, press it. And here you ask six times because this centre has got six petals, “Mother, please give me pure knowledge”. As soon as you ask for pure knowledge, this kundalini your mother starts rising like a [UNCLEAR, premium] in the seed. So now you have to nourish your upper centres with your self-confidence.

So please take your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen, on the left hand side and press it. Here you have to say with full confidence 10 times, “Mother, I am my own master”, 10 times. I have already told you at the very outside that you are not this body, this mind, this ego, this conditionings but you are the pure Spirit.

So now please raise your right hand on your heart, and say with full confidence 12 times, “Mother, I am the pure Spirit”. I have already told you that you are not to feel guilty. This all-pervading power is the ocean of knowledge; it is the ocean of love and peace but above all is the ocean of forgiveness. Whatever mistakes, you might have committed, are easily resolved with the power of compassion.

So you surrender it that is Islam to surrender to this power of love.

So now raise your right hand in the corner of your neck and shoulder and turn your head to your right. Here you have to say 16 times, “Mother I am not guilty at all”. Also I have told you that whether you forgive or don’t forgive, you don’t do anything. But if you don’t forgive then you play into wrong hand and you make yourself miserable. This centre is a very constructive centre. And if you do not forgive all of them, this centre will not open. As it is you have tortured yourself by not forgiving. And at this moment if you do not forgive the centre won’t open. Also you will miss the chance, the great chance of realization.

Please raise your hand on top of your forehead across and please put down your head. Here you have to say not how many times but from your heart, “Mother I forgive everyone in general”. Say it from your heart.

Now please take your right hand on the backside of your head and push back your head. Here without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, just for your satisfaction, you have to say again from your heart, “O Divine power, please forgive me if I have done any mistake knowingly or unknowingly”.

Now the last centre, please stretch your palm and put it on the fontanel bone area which was a soft bone in your childhood, the centre of the palm. Here again I cannot force self-realization on you. Please bend your head. Please bend your head. Now move your skull 7 times slowly, say “Mother please give me self-realization”.

Now please take down your hands, please put both the hands towards me and watch me without thinking. You may not think, there is no thought, you are in present.

Now please put your left hand towards me and right hand also and see if you are feeling thoughtlessly aware. Now please put you’re your right hand towards me and bend your head and see for yourself, if there is a cool or a hot breeze, like vibrations coming out of your fontanel bone area, to the centre of your head. Don’t put, please don’t put it on top, away from your head. And some people get it close and some people get it far.

Now please put the left hand and again bend your head, and see for yourself, if there is a cool or hot breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area which was the soft bone in your childhood. Please move your hand.

If it is hot that means you are not forgiven, so even now you should forgive. After the heat it will become cool. Once again with the right hand, put down your head and see for yourself with the left hand if there is cool breeze coming out of your head or hot breeze.

Now raise your hands up in the sky, open your hands and ask in your heart 3 times

“Mother is this the cool breeze of the ruh?” or ask a question

“Mother is this the all-pervading power of Divine love?” in our language, we say

“is this the Paramchaitanya?”

Now put down your hands please, put your hands like this. They have put off the air conditioning. All those who are feeling cool breeze or hot breeze on their hands, on fingertips, palms or out of their fontanel bone area, please raise both your hands, cool or hot breeze [UNCLEAR]. All of you got it, May God bless you. So, all of you have it. Maybe one or two, they can also get it. You will feel extremely peaceful. And the joy will start bubbling. Now know that for the first time you have felt the ruh. But you have to work it out, the raising of kundalini, at least for few days when they are having a follow on to fix the connection. So you have to respect the self-realization. You don’t have to pay anything. But of course you have to give some time for yourself. And once you are established, you will be the masters.

Thank you very much.
