Shri Mataji: I love this special bhajan they are going to now play for you, it’s written by a great saint, Tulasi Dasa. The description here is of a little Shri Rama, while walking, how He used to walk in a particular beautiful manner. And He would fall down, and again He would get up, and all that description of a child.

I don’t think – I haven’t seen any such poetry in the Western areas, describing a little child, how he walks, how he runs – you see, this is one of the very big things to understand.

I don’t know about Italians, because they have lot of love for children; but the description is so beautiful of a little baby getting up, and He is an incarnation. And just like another child, how He walks and how He crawls.

Now, thumakata itself is a very lyrical word I should say, which is going well with the tabla also as such, we use that, or you can say it’s rhythmic.

So the whole concept in India is that a child is something very Divine, and if it’s an incarnation, the childhood of an incarnation has to be very great.

I haven’t seen one poem – if you find anywhere – in the history of English, German, French and Italian where they have described a child’s movement – I’ll be very happy, because this is how you respect and enjoy a child.

Alright?

I’m sorry to say, but our country is full of this kind of love.

Thank you.

We have to be really very much grateful to these three great artists, you know them, all of them, you know Sangita whom I knew since she was a little girl, also Mr Ronu Mukherjee who has played before us. I asked Babamama what is his name, he said: “His name is Ronu”.

I said: “How can that be, must be some other name also”.

So it’s alright – he said: “No, because he never cried, that’s why he was called as Ronu”. Just like Babamama, you know.

Now we have before us a very great genius, is this Sukhwinder Singh Namdhari.

Somehow these Namdhari people have a great attraction for Sahaja Yoga. I went to Thailand, there were so many Namdharis.

This is what we are doing, is Sikhism only. But it’s the Namdharis who can see that this is the same about what Guru Nanaka has talked about.

They are the first people to enter into. Now of course we have many, and he's, he belongs to the same very sensitive sect, I think they are very sensitive, this sect.

I think he must have been a great musician in last life, also all of them.

Otherwise you cannot achieve at this young age this kind of mastery.

And to do the accompaniment, the Sanghat, is a very difficult thing. I think is easy to play solo, but to go with the mood and everything of the musician, and to bring out the beauty without going into competition, but to slow down at a point, and heighten at a point, and all that little, little things, comes from a very large heart. And from a heart which is already a realized soul.

Otherwise it cannot work out. I have seen people fighting on the stage also sometimes.

As you know, her mother is a great musician herself, right.

And I hope I am going to meet her. I went to Banaras because she asked Me to go there.

And it’s as if through these musician also our family of Sahaja Yoga is expanding so much. And the way they are realizing the oneness of our lives and oneness of our value system.

As if they are all getting absolutely lost into our own families of Sahaja yogis.

It’s – I don’t find any difference because they all have vibrations, they all play with vibrations, and nothing goes wrong.

I have seen it’s just like as we say Sanchar hona, I felt there was Sanchar in them the way they started playing, the whole Shakti started moving in them.

And it was a remarkable thing I have seen, whether they are Muslims, Christians, Hindus, Sikhs or anything. It is this music transcends themselves.

This Nusrat Ali Khan Sahib was sitting on the stage. And he just looked at Me, I don’t know what he knows about Me. And he said to Me : “Ma, come and sit next to Me here”. I was amazed how he recognized Me. I was like any other audience sitting there, so, like, I was sitting on the ground. He just called Me, I was so surprised at this gentleman Nusrat Ali Khan.

So it transcends, you know. This music is Divine, it transcends all races, all religion, all nonsensical divisive ideas. No doubt about it. And that is what is Sahaja Yoga.

And so all these great talents are born today. There were two boys, little, sitting here, I must tell you, one of them plays very beautiful Murli and another plays tabla. Both of them very good and very difficult song they played. I was surprised how they have picked up, and they are picking up so fast.

So the talent among Sahaja yogis as I told you that this music of Saatajanam was, not only was written down by them in Hindi way, absolutely they didn’t know Hindi – in Hindi. Also it was composed, it was put to tune and also to the dam. By them only.

Now so, how our music is spreading into their hearts! And this our music which is Indian music is really, is a Divine music.

Also they have very beautiful, very beautiful classical music, no doubt about them, and I also enjoy that very much.

But our music is a different type, because in this the rapport is established between the artist and the listeners.

And every time they can start creating, they have freedom to create.

And that’s what I think the Sahaja yogis are just all the time like to hear only our Indian classical music, all the time. And they appreciate it very much. Whatever country they may come from, but you’ll be amazed how they enjoy this music.

And this is to also say, one of the desires of My father that he said that our music is so Divine, it should reach the whole world.

And now, for your information, we have already started a very beautiful music academy in Nagpur, and we bought a very beautiful land there, and I would like all of you to visit that place sometimes, and see these young people within three months’ time – they sing Malkauns just like any great musician, any raga.

I was surprised how these people – Rumania they sing Qawwalis so beautifully that everybody will be amazed, you know, there’s some sort of a spark in them.

So not only it is spirituality, but the beauty of spirituality is expressed in so many ways.

I don’t know how to thank you here, My children, I don’t know how to thank you for giving this beautiful time to all of us, and we enjoyed ourselves very much. And I hope you’ll make it easy to come to India also, especially for My birthday we always try to invite many people.

So I think already I am extending you invitations, and they’ll be all very happy to have you there, all music pagals. I tell you, all of them are ek dum bilkul diwane hai.

So, this little thing that we have for you... Sangita? As your name is, you are. Whatever small, they could give... eh?

Sukhwinder! I don’t know what to say about you.

You are... Majumdar! Ah! .
