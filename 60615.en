Shri Mataji: The truth is that we are not this body, this intellect, emotions, this ego, the conditionings, but we are the spirit. And the second truth is that there is a subtle , All-pervading Divine Power which is doing all the living work.

Announcer: In 1970 Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi founded Sahaja Yoga, a dynamic technique for meditation that takes us beyond our limitations. Through the awakening of the spiritual energy within us, we can experience the integration of all aspects of our life, physical, mental, emotional and spiritual. Thousands of people from more than 40 countries have experienced this enlightenment. True peace in the world will only be achieved through the inner transformation of human beings.  Sahaja yoga, [is] the unique discovery.

Shri Mataji: I bow to all the seekers of truth. Truth is something, which can not be changed.  It can not be challenged.  It can not be imagined. One has to feel the truth on your central nervous system. What is the truth? The truth is that you are not this body, you are not this mind, you are not this intelligence, you are not these  conditionings or your ego, but you are pure spirit. This is one truth. The second one is that this whole universe is covered with a very subtle energy, which is called as the  All-pervading  Power of God’s love. Or in Sanskrit  language it is called as  Paramchaitanya. These are the two things which we have to seek, and this is what once we know what it is, then the truth you can feel it on your central nervous system. For this happening, there is an element arrangement within us already made within our being, is a power which is a residual power of Kundalini. It is called as Kundalini because it is coiled in three and half coils.  It is resting in the triangular bone called as sacrum. That shows that the Greeks knew that it was a sacred bone. Now, this is the energy that has to be awakened, and when it is awakened, it rises through 6 very subtle energy centres and pierces through the fontanelle bone area. And then you feel as if a cool breeze is coming out of your fontanel bone area. But this  is just like a connection with the mains, as we have  for every instrument. With this happening, you become a self-realized  person in the sense that you develop a new dimension in your awareness in your central nervous system. On which you can feel the centres of these chakras of your own being and that or others. So you get the self-knowledge , also you get the knowledge about others, what are their problems. Thus, you become collectively conscious, as Jung has said that [the] next stage of human awareness is going to be collectively conscious. So you become collectively conscious, it is a question of becoming it is not just a certificate, it is not exercise. Sahaja, ‘saha’ means with, and ‘ja’ is born with you. Also, sahaj means spontaneous. Yoga means the union with this All-pervading Divine Power. . Sahaja Yoga is the right of every human being to achieve that ascent. In the evolutionary process, we have come to the stage where we are human beings.  But the knowledge that we have is not absolute, to get to the absolute knowledge, we have to rise higher into [a] new realm beyond thought. And this [is] a new realm which you achieve after Sahaja yoga, by which you feel the truth, the absolute truth, and everybody feels the same. With the awakening of the Kundalini, so many things also happen, because it nourishes all your centres. By the nourishment of the centres, you find that your health suddenly improves. Definitely Sahaja yoga has cured many psychosomatic diseases like cancer, no doubt about it. But it only happens if the Kundalini rises and pierces through your fontanel bone area. Then it only happens, and it works out in a way that will definitely show you that something new has happened. But apart from that you get your mental peace. Many mental cases have been cured. Also, you get your intelligence suddenly sharpened up because the brain that you are using is just a bit part but, with the light of the spirit comes into your brain, you start seeing things much more deeply and understanding them much better. It is such a remarkable thing, that it has to happen to all of us as the last jump or breakthrough  into the evolutionary process. As this Sahaja Yoga is not a new thing, it has been there, but it was only transmitted from one master to one disciple. Only in the  twelve century, somebody wrote about it very clearly for the masses, and now it is becoming practical and thousands of people are getting realization all over the world. May God bless you all.
