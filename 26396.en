Tomorrow we have to prepare. It will be a nice [unclear].

Shri Mataji: [Unclear], you can take her purse [unsure]. Because she doesn't want me to take her purse.

Arnaud: Perfect.

Shri Mataji: Can you please bring that one?

Yes, it fits.

Shri Mataji: Today is [unclear] everybody’s purse here? Is it? Today is [unclear] everybody's pure.
Sahaja Yogini: Oh, well, maybe. Not [unclear]
Shri Mataji: Yes, they didn't do that to me last time, I was
not even aware.
Sahaja Yogini: No, of course they won't, Mother.

Shri Mataji: We go?
Sahaja Yogini: Jai Shri Mataji. They just wait to check if the [unclear] is just under. But you don't wait down there.

Shri Mataji: Please, be seated.

Shri Mataji: We have to see now, tonight, how it works out. Please translate.
That we have to, we have to see how it works put, here, tonight. How many people are there, to the program.
[To the translator] Please translate. You can sit here.
Because Gregoire came here. That time, there was this concert, you see. And so many people came from all over the world. There were 500 people for this concert. But how many Brazilians we got?
[Sahaja Yogis discuss in Portuguese]

So, we have no idea, you know, how many Brazilians are taking to Sahaja Yoga. So, because according to her, when they had their programs, they had only two people.
And also, [unclear] they came, but they are doing Osho [unsure]. And especially this Sathya Saibaba. I mean, if they are with this Saibaba, I think they are lost.

Firstly, but they do like these thieves, you see. It's not of spirituality [unclear].
Yes, but they like these thieves. Sainath is different. This Saibaba is the one who creates black magic.
Sahaja Yogini: You want [unclear]?
Shri Mataji: All right.

Brasilia was a great experience. Also Salvador. But I don't know about this place. We had a bad time that day, yesterday.
There's a way, you see, they just asked Me questions, [unclear].
Sahaja Yogini: [Unclear].

[Shri Mataji is laughing.] He has too many, I think. [Unsure] You know, they upset him. I didn't know why she behaves like that. [Unclear].
Sahaja Yogini: It doesn’t matter. Did he explain to you Mother? He wrote the letter. I brought the letter to the program. Ask the way to receive [unclear] prepare to announce your coming. But not for you and I gave her, [unclear] watch. [Unclear].
Because it's not it's like [unclear] it's not a program, it's not serious.
Shri Mataji: But they all said, that they want to focus on the mother. That's what they told Me.
Sahaja Yogini: But they changed everything, they [unclear]. But anyway, it was amazing, it was a very important program. Not because it's important, it's available, but because everybody sees it.
And the most important is the people [unclear]. But it's during daytime and so they want people like housewives and young people to see it's [unclear]. And people who doesn't work.
So, they want like a magazine. And our people, our people here in Brazil, they don't have enough culture, formatted culture, and they go like this, they ask full of questions to people like, "What you do?". My son-in-law went to [unclear] and he a scientist and he is astronomy and he asked you believe in the flying [unclear] things like this.
[Unclear conversation]
Anyway they saw you, they saw you.
Shri Mataji: That’s what
Sahaja Yogini: So it's like putting outdoor: we didn't have money to put a big outdoor.

Shri Mataji: But I think, she should be corrected, she should not have here said that, "[Unclear] Mother. She's gone for the [unclear]". She should not have said.
Sahaja Yogini: [Unclear] For me it was great that the new minister of Health was here.
Anyway, I think it's was good for him. He doesn't know that it was good for him to be here.
Shri Mataji: And he had a [unclear] you know [unclear].
[Shri Mataji is laughing.]

[Unclear] They can also think a lot. What kind of health is [unclear]?

Sahaja Yogini: You have a lot of work to do Mother.
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Sahaja Yogini: You have a lot to do here.
Shri Mataji: Yes, I mean I was just laughing when the boys [unclear]
Sahaja Yogini: I thought it was strange but I understood -

Shri Mataji: You know what to ask Me. You know what to ask Me. She got lost. She should have asked me, "What is the advantage of taking Self-realisation, what you get out of it, And what about health? " And [unclear].
Sahaja Yogini: People, do when they go to the program, they don't stop talking. They start talking "bla, bla, bla". What we used to say is, "Stop, stop, stop". Because they know, if she asks questions, the questions will be very silly and so they, they just talk.
Shri Mataji: That means they talk too much.
