Shri Mataji: Have you all meditated?
All right. So, I need to go I'll come back in the evening. Program is tomorrow?
Sahaja Yogi: Today, it's tonight, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Tonight. So, I'll be back and we’ll have the program tonight.
Tomorrow we have to prepare. It will be a nice [unclear].

Shri Mataji: [Unclear], you can take her purse [unsure]. Because she doesn't want me to take her purse.
Arnaud: I can take. Would you like me to take this?
Shri Mataji: Yes.
Arnaud: Perfect.

Shri Mataji: Can you please bring that one?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Shri Mataji. Into this?
Shri Mataji: It fits?
Arnaud: It fits, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: In front.
Yes, it fits.

Shri Mataji: Today is [unclear] everybody’s purse here? Is it? Today is [unclear] everybody's pure.
Sahaja Yogini: Oh, well, maybe. Not [unclear]
Shri Mataji: Yes, they didn't do that to me last time, I was
not even aware.
Sahaja Yogini: No, of course they won't, Mother.

Shri Mataji: We go?
Sahaja Yogini: Jai Shri Mataji. They just wait to check if the [unclear] is just under. But you don't wait down there.

Shri Mataji: Please, be seated.

Shri Mataji: We have to see now, tonight, how it works out. Please translate.
That we have to, we have to see how it works put, here, tonight. How many people are there, to the program.
[To the translator] Please translate. You can sit here.
Because Gregoire came here. That time, there was this concert, you see. And so many people came from all over the world. There were 500 people for this concert. But how many Brazilians we got?
[Sahaja Yogis discuss in Portuguese]

So, we have no idea, you know, how many Brazilians are taking to Sahaja Yoga. So, because according to her, when they had their programs, they had only two people.
And also, [unclear] they came, but they are doing Osho [unsure]. And especially this Sathya Saibaba. I mean, if they are with this Saibaba, I think they are lost.

Firstly, but they do like these thieves, you see. It's not of spirituality [unclear].
Yes, but they like these thieves. Sainath is different. This Saibaba is the one who creates black magic.
Sahaja Yogini: You want [unclear]?
Shri Mataji: All right.

Brasilia was a great experience. Also Salvador. But I don't know about this place. We had a bad time that day, yesterday.
There's a way, you see, they just asked Me questions, [unclear].
Sahaja Yogini: [Unclear].

[Shri Mataji is laughing.] He has too many, I think. [Unsure] You know, they upset him. I didn't know why she behaves like that. [Unclear].
Sahaja Yogini: It doesn’t matter. Did he explain to you Mother? He wrote the letter. I brought the letter to the program. Ask the way to receive [unclear] prepare to announce your coming. But not for you and I gave her, [unclear] watch. [Unclear].
Because it's not it's like [unclear] it's not a program, it's not serious.
Shri Mataji: But they all said, that they want to focus on the mother. That's what they told Me.
Sahaja Yogini: But they changed everything, they [unclear]. But anyway, it was amazing, it was a very important program. Not because it's important, it's available, but because everybody sees it.
And the most important is the people [unclear]. But it's during daytime and so they want people like housewives and young people to see it's [unclear]. And people who doesn't work.
So, they want like a magazine. And our people, our people here in Brazil, they don't have enough culture, formatted culture, and they go like this, they ask full of questions to people like, "What you do?". My son-in-law went to [unclear] and he a scientist and he is astronomy and he asked you believe in the flying [unclear] things like this.
[Unclear conversation]
Anyway they saw you, they saw you.
Shri Mataji: That’s what
Sahaja Yogini: So it's like putting outdoor: we didn't have money to put a big outdoor.

Shri Mataji: But I think, she should be corrected, she should not have here said that, "[Unclear] Mother. She's gone for the [unclear]". She should not have said.
Sahaja Yogini: [Unclear] For me it was great that the new minister of Health was here.
Anyway, I think it's was good for him. He doesn't know that it was good for him to be here.
Shri Mataji: And he had a [unclear] you know [unclear].
[Shri Mataji is laughing.]

[Unclear] They can also think a lot. What kind of health is [unclear]?

Sahaja Yogini: You have a lot of work to do Mother.
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Sahaja Yogini: You have a lot to do here.
Shri Mataji: Yes, I mean I was just laughing when the boys [unclear]
Sahaja Yogini: I thought it was strange but I understood -

Shri Mataji: You know what to ask Me. You know what to ask Me. She got lost. She should have asked me, "What is the advantage of taking Self-realisation, what you get out of it, And what about health? " And [unclear].
Sahaja Yogini: People, do when they go to the program, they don't stop talking. They start talking "bla, bla, bla". What we used to say is, "Stop, stop, stop". Because they know, if she asks questions, the questions will be very silly and so they, they just talk.
Shri Mataji: That means they talk too much.

Sahaja Yogini: Because it's the HAD [unclear] belongs to the government.
Shri Mataji: But another lady who said she’s a [unclear].
Sahaja Yogini: She is a very famous writer. She has a ‘colm’. She met a-
Shri Mataji: Column.
Sahaja Yogini: Colum in newspapers and she's a, she lives in Portugal now. And she writes for about 30 years a same column, sending news from aboard. So, she's elderly, she's old lady but she's very intelligent. And she's very famous here, really, especially. And the people here like sleeping, I think. They don't sleep too much.
Shri Mataji: But she was not at all [unclear].
Sahaja Yogini: It's like going-
Shri Mataji: And there also, she was making a big drama.
Sahaja Yogini: Yes.
[Laughter]

Another Sahaja Yogini: They couldn't bear to be in front Shri Mataji.
Sahaja Yogini: You can hear his breath and not get hot. "Keep cool, keep cool, don't get too hot". And things go like this, like-
Shri Mataji: That's true.
Sahaja Yogini: It's like singing. So they talk about-
Shri Mataji: But I think she had prepared her speech at home [unclear].
Sahaja Yogini: No they don’t get mad, they go like this and bring the things together [unsure].
And change one subject for the other.

Shri Mataji: That was not a place for Me. And she should not have insisted on my coming. That was a mistake here. And then she got lost. She didn't know what to say. Because a soon as she came to Me, she started shaking.
Sahaja Yogini: There is, there was another interview for you. That was for you with a famous humourist. He's very intelligent but he never treats nobody like hot [unsure]. [Unclear] and he never gives a treatment for the person. So, I was so afraid and it was [unclear] power. And people keep talking, But you refuse to go to that program.

Shri Mataji: No, I have been to so many of them. You see all kinds of [unclear]. But I never go to the studio [unclear]. It’s only the second time I’ve been to the studio.
Sahaja Yogini: Anyway, it was the best [unclear].
Another Yogini: Yes. She thinks it was the best propaganda. It was a bliss too, all your programs.

Shri Mataji: A short [unclear] must have been [unclear].
I said, "You come to my program". She said, "I want to contribute".
Sahaja Yogini: That was the best one. I think if the seekers could see you, they feel touched.

Shri Mataji: So, let us go. [Unclear name] comes here?
Arnaud: He's waiting for us, here.
Shri Mataji: So, we should go. Very sweet, very [unclear].

May God bless you.
Whatever it is, let’s take [unclear]. It’s all right.
She was very upset. I thought that this lady is trying to find out [unclear] Maria. She was not. But I was not understanding what she was talking. [Shri Mataji is laughing.]

And when she came, she started shaking and when she looked at Me also. Poor thing, something is wrong with her. She smokes.
Sahaja Yogini: Smoking?
Shri Mataji: Yes. She smokes a lot.

With Me, she was smoking all the time.
Arnaud: And the smile was so unnatural. Her smile was just unnatural that she must sleep with a smile like that, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: But I think, [unclear].

Sahaja Yogini: You see, they have power.
Shri Mataji: Pleasant, pleasant face. She must be quite a pleasant face.
I must say. Only before Me, she started shaking, otherwise she was [unclear].
Sahaja Yogini: Shaking?
[Shri Mataji mimes.]

Shri Mataji: That’s why I had a particular [unclear]. I said, "See [unclear] ".
Sahaja Yogini: Mother, she was so, she was feeling something.
Shri Mataji: I saw that. As you said that people have seen Me and heard. She didn't know what to ask, she didn’t know. One has to see [unclear].
Sahaja Yogini: Streaming on TV it's like spreading like [unclear]. It's so important. I can’t imagine.
Shri Mataji: Because she said they had focussed on Me. That's why they got it.
If she had not said that, I would not have gone. I was not going myself. But she insisted.

Sahaja Yogini: It was a threat, Mother.
Shri Mataji: Just to [unclear] Me.

As soon as I went there, they were [unclear] on the chair and all. And it took half an hour for Me to sit down.

It’s all right. I mean [unclear] have experienced [unclear].

So, let us see what happens.
