b'\n1986-02-19 Morning Program in Jaipur\n\nSahaja yogi: Jai Shri Mataji! All the brothers who are standing outside, please come inside. In a short while Shri Mataji is going to come. All the brothers and sisters who are waiting for Shri Mataji, please come inside. As soon as you come inside we will start the program. Please come inside.\n\nSong in the background\n\nSahaja yogi: Shri Mataji is going to come. Till then we will talk a little about Sahaja Yoga. Please come and sit in your respective places. Brothers who are standing behind, please sit down. Jai Shri Mataji!\n\nToday we have gathered here on the third day of the program to receive something and learn more about what we want to receive. We are all are here for that purpose. Today, Shri Mataji will tell you about some more chakras, and also about Sahastrara, but before She comes, I want to explain about the same chakras in an easy way, through this chart, so that when She talks about chakras you will understand it better.\n\nAnybody can come to the chart. I don\xe2\x80\x99t need anybody to speak, but someone who can understand when I speak about the chakras to point them out. The chakra names are universal.\n\nThis Sahaja yogi is a doctor who has come from England and his name is Dr. Bogdan. Together we will explain about chakras. I will talk, and he will show the chakras with the pointer.\n\nYesterday, Shri Mataji told you about the initial chakra, which is Mooladhara. The deity and king of this chakra, who takes care of Mooladhara in your subtle system, and who initiates your awareness, starts from this chakra, on which Shri Ganesha is present.\n\nHere, I want to tell you in the beginning that we have heard many stories about the form and the formless, but God is present in both the form and the formless. The only difference is that our eyes cannot see the abstract or formless. In our brain we have different images of the formless, but our physical eyes can only see the concrete form. So, weak people like me think that, if I can see the form, one day the formless will appear before me.\n\nSo, without falling into any discussion, I want to tell you that this pure form of Shri Mataji, whose name is Nirmala, is the embodiment of Adi Shakti. You must have heard and felt that the source of all the shaktis is the Adi Shakti. So, today we are fortunate that Shri Adi Shakti, in her physical form, that is, in the form of Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi, is coming before us. You all want to see miracles, and there cannot be a bigger miracle than this.\n\nHowever, there is a seed of doubt in our minds, which is clouding our eyes and is not allowing us to see the truth which is before us. That is why the awakening of Kundalini has become necessary. What happens when the Kundalini is awakened is that your body parts are separated from one another; our mental state does not support our physical condition, our physical state does not match our emotions, and as far as our spirit is concerned, we have completely forgotten about it or it is covered with so many layers that we don\xe2\x80\x99t understand anything. So, the awakening of Kundalini is important because the energy which is situated in the triangular bone, above Shri Ganesha\'s chakra in Mooladhara, in our spinal cord, is sitting there and is born with us. Now, we have to understand and awaken this energy, in a very easy way, because when this energy is in a dormant state, we face physical, mental and emotional problems and our whole system goes helter-skelter. We don\'t understand what we are doing. One minute we go into depression, and the next minute we become so aggressive that we start fighting, our ego develops, and we get stuck in this whirlpool.\n\nAnd why does it happen? If we want to co-ordinate our physical, mental, emotional and spiritual states, by the combination of which we humans are made, then we need to awaken this energy which is inside us. But to do that we need to know ourselves first. People who have attended this program in the last two days, and those who have felt the vibrations, are Self-realized. Those who could not feel the vibrations also are Self-realized; accept this. The only difference is that as the Kundalini gets stuck in some chakras, only a few strands of it come out of the fontanelle bone, and so they are not able to feel it. As soon as you come in front of Shri Mataji, who never differentiates between Her children, you attain Self-realization.\n\nNow, the remaining thing is that when your Kundalini awakens completely, then you will see how you feel. You remember one thing. As all of us have shortcomings, we get diseases and we run to doctors or to physicians, or to any kind of yoga practitioner, to cure ourselves. As I observed in the past two days, some brothers and sisters came to me in Bhagwan Das Road with the only intention of curing themselves. I told them humbly that I am a doctor, but if you people want the regular treatment, please go to Sawai Madho Singh hospital or any other health centre and take the treatment. You may be all right for some time, and then the same problem will start again. But here the treatment is of a totally different kind. The difference is, I say, that you become your own doctor.\n\nWe are presenting for you the method by which you become your own doctor. When you become your own doctor, and start raising your Kundalini, because of the power given to you by the grace of Shri Mataji, then you will understand Her power. If it was some other guru, he would always try to make disciples. At least, I have neither heard nor seen any guru who tells you, \xe2\x80\x9cYou become your own master,\xe2\x80\x9d and also tells you how to become that. In my sixty years of experience I have seen that only Adi Shakti, who has incarnated on this earth, can do this kind of job, because we all are Her children, and She wants each and every child of Hers to become so strong that he can take care of himself.\n\nSo, we should try not to go to the left sometimes and to the right sometimes. God has given us two shoulders and a head in between. So let us at least try to keep it that way. This is what Sahaja Yoga teaches you, that it is a matter of someone going towards Ida Nadi and some towards Pingala Nadi. But in Sushumna, when you raise your Kundalini, which is your individual mother, along with your spirit, when it comes out of the fontanelle bone, then the vibrations of the All-pervading Power, which flows in your body and passes through every part of your body, comes out. Then is it possible that any germ will survive against this power? Or is it possible, that any part of your body doesn\'t become all right? When your body parts get nourished with proper food, that is vibrations, it is impossible that you will not get cured of any disease.\n\nSo, I always say that when you are learning Sahaja Yoga, when you are learning how to awaken your Kundalini, then you should work hard enough to raise your own Kundalini. Here in this crowd there are many people whose Kundalini has risen within seconds, and possibly they might have been great sages in their previous births and may not be aware of it. Their Kundalini rises with full force, within seconds, and sustains itself in the Sahastrara. There are many people in the world of this kind, that if I start talking about them, I may have to stay here all morning. But I want to tell you that some people have seen so many miracles and that they have been cured of diseases like cancer. However, if you think that just by touching Shri Mataji\'s feet you are going to get rid of all your problems, then that is not going to happen. So, I request you all that whoever has any kind of problem, and if they want to cure themselves, then please listen to Shri Mataji very carefully today. Absorb everything inside you and learn how to raise your Kundalini by the grace of Shri Mataji, in Her presence, and start practicing this every day.\n\nHere on this earth, many sages came to know about Kundalini, after taking thousands of births. Today in this Kali Yuga, we are so lucky to gain this knowledge, comfortably sitting in this place, with a roof over our head and lights around us, without going to the Himalayas, without doing hatha yoga, because Goddess Adi Shakti decided to take birth in a form, give realisation to the children who are seeking their spirit and raise their Kundalini, so that the children can take care of themselves, and slowly you will learn how to work on others when you are working on yourself. When you have any problems on your chakras, and you learn the methods to clear them, what happens is that your Kundalini will awaken, and after coming out of the fontanelle bone, it will communicate with Adi Shakti. At the same time, other Sahaja yogis\xe2\x80\x99 Kundalini also would have risen. At this time, when a communication system is established through Adi Shakti, we are connected, whether we are here or ten thousand miles apart. Then you will feel the reflection of the person on your chakras, who is in your attention. So, you will see that if someone\'s Nabhi Chakra is catching, whether he is here or in London, you will feel the sensation in your finger, and in an attempt to clear the other person you will also benefit.\n\nNow there are doctors like me who have been learning throughout and think that we know everything, but after coming to Sahaja we realise that what we know is a myth. We do nothing. The power which does everything is among us. I am just a witness because I am a spirit, and if we are witnessing, then we cannot be doers.\n\nSo, I humbly request you not to touch Shri Mataji\'s feet when She comes here. Also, don\xe2\x80\x99t start discussing your ailments with Her, because you don\xe2\x80\x99t know that as soon as you come in front of Shri Mataji, She knows on which chakra you are catching and what is your problem. Without your saying so, She absorbs all your problems in Her body. After this, Her body suffers so much that last night four of us had to sit with her for three hours to remove the negative vibrations from Her. Do you want to trouble Her in this way? If you want to, then say yes. Otherwise, stay calm.\n\nShri Mataji has arrived. Sit peacefully and listen to Her and, as I told you before, if you have any queries please talk to Sahaja yogis.\n\nSong in the backgound\n\nBackground voice: Whoever is standing, please sit down. Whoever is outside, kindly come inside the pendal and sit down.\n\n1-st translation of SHRI MATAJI\'S speech\n\nMy salutations to the seekers of Jaipur. The seeker is one who achieves something. One who only entertains himself, keeps singing bhajans, wanders from temple to temple, and spends his whole life like this, has not achieved anything. There should be an instrument through which you get connected to the Divine, through which communication can happen, and the Divine has already equipped this instrument, very beautifully, inside us. The one and only thing remaining is that we make use of this instrument. Inside each and every plexus or chakra in our subtle system, there is a deity present. We believe in Ganapati, but we do not know that Ganapati is present inside us. We believe in Lakshmi and Vishnu, but we do not know that they are present inside us. Just now Jagadamba\'s song was being sung; Jagadamba also is present inside us.\n\nYesterday, I told you about Nabhi Chakra. When Brahma created this universe, the Void was created around the Nabhi Chakra, and to establish religion inside this Void, starting from Adi Guru to this day, many great personalities have taken birth, who have ten principles. These ten principles bind our human religion. This human religion is present inside us, just like ten valencies are present inside carbon. These saints have been illuminating their ten principles inside us from the time of creation, and we are supposed to adhere to these principles, but human beings, in their ego or misunderstandings, turn religion into irreligion. That is why we see many deformations in our religion, and we start thinking that there is no religion and there is no God. Religion is present inside us.\n\nMany incarnations have introduced religions to us. For example, Shri Ramchandra ate Shabri\'s already-tasted berries. Shri Ram Chandra, who was an excellent man from Suryavansh, ate the berries which were offered to him by an old lady, Shabari, after she tasted them. Shri Rama ate them with lots of affection. There is a very strong religion implemented in this, and that religion is that love is most liked by the Divine. A human being who doesn\'t have love in his heart can never step over the threshold of the Divine, and the Divine embraces a person, forgetting everything else, whose heart is full of love. For example, Sudamaji carried pounded rice with him, and Shri Krishna ate that with love. We create lots of fuss in the matter of food, but we don\xe2\x80\x99t think that if a person, whoever it may be, offers us any food with utmost love, he is a personification of God. So, the reflection of religion is love.\n\nBut nowadays there is dispute among religions. People may ask, "Mother, if religion means love, then why are people fight among themselves?" The great masters who have taken birth in the world are like flowers blooming on the same tree, at different times. They bloomed on the same tree, but we start plucking them and fighting for them after their death. When they are alive we torture them. If we do not trouble them, we become the witness to their torment. We have troubled each and every saint, and even if we have not troubled them, we have not made any attempt to stop the people who were tormenting them. No one offered a single glass of water to them. These saints are flowers of the celestial tree. We pluck these flowers and fight for the dead flowers, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is my flower. That is your flower. My flower is better than yours." This way, all the flowers are dead, and we are fighting for the dead flowers. The flowers that once decorated the celestial garden have become subjects for dispute today.\n\nSo, this religion is a religion of love because the whole power is due to the love of the Divine. If God did not love us, He would not have created this universe, but we don\'t love ourselves. We negate and imprison ourselves and impose our own thoughts on ourselves, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cThese are my thoughts and they are right. They are correct.\xe2\x80\x9d So when we imprison ourselves with this kind of conviction, then others also do the same thing, and keep shouting. Human beings become independent in love. They start knowing their own mechanism. So, religion is love.\n\nAt times, situations arose where violence had to be used, such as when Shri Krishna told Arjuna during the war, \xe2\x80\x9cKill all these people, because they are already dead.\xe2\x80\x9d He did not teach Arjuna today\'s non-violence that also protects all kinds of insects. Am I going to give Kundalini awakening to these insects that you are protecting? At that time, Shri Krishna said, \xe2\x80\x9cKill all these people, and kill your guru also.\xe2\x80\x9d You should understand the religion completely. You know the story of Karna when his foot got stuck in the wheels of the chariot. At that time, Arjuna lifted his bow at Karna. Then Karna said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou are a warrior, and I am also a warrior. According to the rules, you cannot attack a weapon-less person.\xe2\x80\x9d At that time Shri Krishna raised his finger towards Karna and said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhere was your chivalry when Draupadi\'s modesty was under attack?\xe2\x80\x99 So he killed him. Only violence is going to work with evil. We people are violent with good people and use non-violence for evil. There are many people among us who would say, \xe2\x80\x9cWe protect insects,\xe2\x80\x9d but the same people, when they want to capture someone\'s property, will not hesitate to bring his wife and children to the streets. They will insult him and won\'t mind sending the only breadwinner of the family behind bars, just for a small amount of money. This is not religion. This is irreligion. We should understand the definition of religion from the incarnations who came before us. They established the chakras within us and also set an ideology before us, which we should understand.\n\nNow the next chakra, after the religion, about which we need to know is the chakra of Jagadamba, about whom people were singing just now. Jagdamba is sitting in the centre of the Heart Chakra. This Heart Chakra is made up of twelve petals. Up till a child is twelve years old, Jagadamba, who is also known as Brahmaramba, creates antibodies in the rib cage. This is called antibodies in English. By the time the child is twelve years old, she finishes making the whole antibodies, and when there is any kind of attack on the child these antibodies fight against them and protect the child. After the age of twelve years, these antibodies spread all over the body. Our rib cage is like All India Radio, from where the command goes out: \xe2\x80\x9cNow fight this disease, and attack here, and if necessary send soldiers\xe2\x80\x9d. In this way they keep fighting all the time, and sometimes they become very tired. This chakra gets caught up, particularly in women, because they don\xe2\x80\x99t trust Jagadamaba, who is their mother, who is all-powerful and who nurtures everyone, who is the protector of everyone. A woman gets scared when her husband is rude to her, or when she hears some fearsome story. This land is bestowed with heroic personalities, like Queen Padmini, who have been living examples in history. But nowadays, ladies are very scared of everything, and men also suppress them unnecessarily and do not take care of them. For this reason, women get caught up on the Heart Chakra, and they get breast cancer, mostly. When this chakra gets caught up in men, they start getting scared of every small thing. Their hands and feet start shivering for almost everything. Jagadamba is sitting in a place from where she protects and pulls her devotees from the Void, when they want to ascend spiritually.\n\nYou know that the Goddess incarnated several times on this earth. She shone for some time in Rajasthali, also in the form of Sakhirani, and all the kings of this place also are devotees of the Devi. In spite of all these, there is a kind of fear and cowardice that has settled in human beings. Truth should not be scared of anything. A person who stands on the truth is never scared of anyone. He boldly faces the whole world and speaks the truth. In 1970, in Jahangir Kavasya Hall, I declared the names of all the devils who have taken birth now, and their names in their previous births. None of them filed any case against Me or created any problem for Me. One person said, \xe2\x80\x9cMother, they will shoot you.\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cLet Me see who has the courage to do so. They will start shivering.\xe2\x80\x9d Even with this kind of mother\xe2\x80\x99s powers, we are timid and cowardly. This is because we have not understood the truth and we never respected bravery. People who follow the untruth are cowards. Mother worships only the truthful people. She adorns and protects them. So, we should remember that Jagadamba is inside us, and we are awakening her. We get many diseases due to the malfunctioning of this plexus or chakra.\n\nThe chakra on the right side of this chakra is called the Right Heart. In Rajasthan, this chakra is easily caught up. This is the chakra of Shri Rama, who is an excellent person. People who are scared of government matters get caught up on this chakra, because Shri Rama was the ideal king. What is the need to be scared of government for those who worship him? When you are in his kingdom what is the need to be scared? He was a maryada purushottam, meaning he never crossed the boundaries of good conduct. Likewise, whoever remains within the boundaries of good conduct cannot be harmed by any government and is fully protected by Shri Rama. People get asthma when this chakra is caught up. This plexus represents our father, as Shri Rama is in the place of our father. This chakra gets damaged if there is a rift in the father-son relationship, or if there is a vacuum in the place of a father, or the father is troubling the child in some way or leading him in the wrong path. This leads to asthma. This disease can be cured. This doesn\'t mean that you bring all the asthma patients to Me. It means that you raise your Kundalini and clear this chakra. Some people have such nice Kundalini that it rises up within seconds and sustains itself, and after that they never get any disease.\n\nThere is another set of people whose Kundalini rises and falls very often. This type of person should raise their Kundalini again and again, as the power of Kundalini is your injection, your medicine, your dhanvantry, your doctor and everything else. If this power doesn\xe2\x80\x99t flow within us, then how will our hands work? There are people whose Kundalini is stuck. It is difficult to correct this kind of person, but if they are dedicated, and they feel at least a little difference, the Kundalini rises in them. I have cured many people and treated them for their diseases, but I have noticed that very few people among them get established in Sahaja Yoga. You should realise that the Divine is very clever, and why would it light a lamp which cannot give light to others? It is waste of time to light such lamps, who come here only to cure themselves.\n\nThere are also many restless people who come to me and say, \xe2\x80\x9cMother, please give me peace of mind.\xe2\x80\x9d Can good health give everything? Today one chakra will get cleared, and tomorrow another will get caught up. Today you will have one disease and tomorrow another. Can I keep curing you day and night? You need humility and good deeds in the past to get realisation. Many people think that they are doing Me a favour by coming to Sahaja Yoga. They don\'t understand that it is our good fortune that we can do Sahaja Yoga and our Kundalini is awakened. The Divine accepts the humans only when they start understanding this fact and rejects the egoistic people who think that they are doing Me a favour. The Divine is doing us the favour. We should be indebted to Him. We should be thankful to Him that, \xe2\x80\x9cGod, you gave us the understanding to come to your door\xe2\x80\x9d. My attention does not stay on people who come here only to cure their diseases. Yes, it is true that when Kundalini rises, like I told you yesterday, all the superficial ailments get cured, but you have to establish the Kundalini with practice. It is also true, like Mrs. Padthal said, that her angina problem got solved within ten minutes. She is a different type of person. I know everyone in their family, and she is different from them. What can I do about it? There are some fruits which ripen faster, some do not ripen at all, and some others remain rotten. So, after awakening the Kundalini, you should understand where to sustain it, how to raise it, how to clear your chakras, and so on. If someone tells you how to do it, please listen to them and do accordingly.\n\nNow above this chakra, in our throat is the chakra of Shri Krishna. In exactly this centre, Shri Krishna used to play with the gopis. Nowadays, there are people who say that Shri Krishna in the Gita is different, and Gopi Krishna is different, and who knows how many other forms of Shri Krishna will be created. There are sixteen petals in this throat chakra. It is called Vishuddhi Chakra, meaning very clear, because you know that Shri Krishna was Yogeshwara, and so no dirt can stick to him. He is Yogeshwara, and when you come to Vishuddhi, nothing adheres to you. You start looking at everything as if you are watching a drama and start witnessing it. Till now you were stuck in the ocean and were scared of the waves, but now you are on a boat and witnessing the same waves. This witnessing power comes inside you. As soon as this power comes inside you, you start witnessing the whole creation, and you are not affected by anything. Secondly, your attention is on getting solutions to your problems. As long as you are stuck in the problem itself, it can never be solved.\n\nThis place of Shri Krishna has two parts, left and right. The left side is the place of Sri Vishnumaya, who you know was Shri Krishna\'s sister, and who went to the heaven and made the celestial announcement to Kans, through the clouds, \xe2\x80\x9cKans, your killer is still alive.\xe2\x80\x9d The same celestial announcement works even today in the form of lightning. Sometimes you will be surprised to see amazing photographs of mine. You will be surprised that a camera, which looks so ordinary, has taken such wonderful pictures of mine even in the clouds. This is a celestial doing. All this is done by Shri Vishnumaya. This chakra gets caught up when we don\'t consider the relationship of brother and sister and look at other women with adulterous eyes. It also gets caught up when we imagine things such as, \xe2\x80\x9cWe have made mistakes, we are sinners, and we are evil\xe2\x80\x9d, and start feeling guilty for nothing. Sometimes I see too much imagination in people who believe, \xe2\x80\x9cI am guilty. I am a sinner\xe2\x80\x9d. This is mostly given to them by others who keep telling them, \xe2\x80\x9cYou are a sinner,\xe2\x80\x9d as if they are saints. As a result, their Left Vishuddhi gets damaged, and along with this, if the Heart Chakra also catches, then fatal diseases like angina can occur. Day and night, most women get tormented, by family members or by the society, or by the husband, that \xe2\x80\x9cYou are bad\xe2\x80\x9d. This can result in many diseases, the most lethal of which is angina.\n\nOn the right side of the Vishuddhi resides Krishna, who in Maharashtra is known as Vitthala and who ruled over Dwarika, which is in your city. When he is in the center, he is in the form of Gopi-Gopika, when he was ruling Dwarika he was on the right side, and on the left his power is that of a woman who was his sister. Radha was his power in the center, and Rukmini, his wife, was his power on the right side. Yesterday I told you that, apart from these five powers, there are sixteen thousand more powers on the right side, but there are also many defects there. Shri Vitthala\'s statue was sighted in Pandarpur, like Govinda Maharaja\'s swayambhu was seen in Jaipur. After that, people started their business there. They used to chew tobacco and walk for a whole month, chanting, "Vitthala, Vitthala, Vitthala.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNow tobacco is against Sri Krishna. He doesn\'t like tobacco at all. This chakra gets spoilt in people who chew or smoke tobacco, and thus they get cancer. The treatment for this is to inhale the fumes of carom seeds and smoke cigarettes made out of carom leaves. This makes Shri Krishna happy. Another treatment for this is that you drink warm water or milk with melted butter in it. Shri Krishna likes butter very much. Also, use ghee and camphor for your nostrils, because you know that camphor is Shri Krishna\'s favourite. Apply camphor on your forehead. Do everything that makes Shri Krishna happy. This may cure your Vishuddhi problems, and your cancer may get treated. When all your throats catch, my throat also catches, and I have to struggle a lot to set it right. Still, sometimes the Kundalini of many people does not awaken at all. Particularly in this Vishuddhi Chakra, there are three entanglements. Because of this, the Left Vishuddhi gets caught up when a person takes mantras from a wrong guru and keeps chanting them throughout the day.\n\nIn Sahaja Yoga there is treatment for all these problems, in the form of mantras and yogasans and also certain elements like water and sugar are used.\n\nThe Agnya Chakra is in the middle of our forehead. This is the place of Shri Maha Vishnu. This has been described in Devi Mahatmya by Markandeya Swami, but who has time nowadays to read that? This is Maha Vishnu\'s place, and on the left side of Maha Vishnu resides Buddha, and on the right resides Mahavira. Buddhists also have tormented Buddha. Shri Buddha said, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\'t talk about any god or any statue, because until you are Self-realized, you are only worshipping a stone. Get this first so that you can differentiate between an ordinary stone and a swayambhu. First and foremost, Self-realization, Self-realization, Self-realization.\xe2\x80\x9d So, people used to say that he was anti-god, but he was a very practical man. In the beginning, I also used to say to get Self-realization first and then we will talk. But like you witnessed yesterday, one person was saying that he doesn\'t want Self-realization. Then why did you come here? Here you get nothing but Self-realization. This is what Buddha said: \xe2\x80\x9cGet your Self-realization first\xe2\x80\x9d, but when he said, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\'t worship anything before getting Self-realization,\xe2\x80\x9d people started misinterpreting him and going in the wrong path.\n\nAs far as Mahavira is concerned, he is the incarnation of Bhairavnath ji, a very great personality. Once, he was meditating in a jungle, and while returning his attire got stuck in a thorny bush. I really feel very bad about this because he is also my son. His dress got torn, and at that time Shri Krishna wanted to test him. So, he told Mahavira, \xe2\x80\x9cYou are an ascetic. So you don\'t require a dress. I am naked. I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a dress. So please give your dress to me.\xe2\x80\x9d Mahavira gave his dress to Shri Krishna. Shri Krishna, who was a king, hid Mahavira\'s dress for a second and wore his clothes, and then went away. But see how people have made fun of this today? Ask a mother if this is how her son should be made fun of. All over the world, they exhibit him in nude form, and they also roam on the streets shamelessly, without clothes. Did Mahavira ask anyone to do this? To become like Mahavira and do this? People have done many kinds of stupid things, which makes me think that their sins will never be forgiven. How can God forgive someone who has insulted such a great saint on stones and cements?\n\nNeminath ji, who was with Shri Krishna, was a Teerthankar and was also the first cousin of Shri Krishna, had an aversion. At his wedding, when he saw many animals and birds being killed, he felt an aversion towards violence. This can happen to anyone. So, he declared that he would never do violence. But did he ever ask you to protect the insects and beetles? You people mistake everything. At least, try to learn the right thing. I spoke to many Jain sages and asked them, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\'t you people meditate, as told by Mahavir ji, instead of constructing temples?\xe2\x80\x9d To that they replied, \xe2\x80\x9cMeditation leads to acquisition of trivial knowledge (shudra siddhi).\xe2\x80\x9d I told them, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is right that you get shudra siddhi. Now do the actual meditation through Sahaja Yoga.\xe2\x80\x9d Now, many Jains have started understanding that Shri Mataji is telling the same thing as Mahavir ji and Buddha, and this is the true Kingdom of God, and it is not right to waste your money and attention on useless things.\n\nThirdly, in the centre of the forehead is Jesus Christ, where we wear his blood in the form of a bindi. Now, what can I say about the stupidity of Christians? There cannot be worse fanatics than Christians. We say Muslims are fanatics. At least, their fanaticism is visible. But Christians are hidden fanatics. They are so stupid that they never understood Jesus Christ properly. Jesus Christ, whose place is in the centre of the optic chiasma, said, \xe2\x80\x9cThou shall not have adulterous eyes,\xe2\x80\x9d meaning your eyes should be so pure that there should not be any kind of greed in them. Tell me, have you ever come across a Christian who does not have greed in his eyes? The solid quality, which He expected Christians to have, is missing in them. This is the case with every religion. When we [Hindus] were told that spirit is present inside us, we divided ourselves into a caste system, according to birth. There can never be caste according to birth, and Vyas ji could never write any such thing. Whoever knows about Vyas ji, knows whose son he was. He was the son of Matsyagandha, who was an unmarried fisherwoman. Could Vyas ji have written this kind of thing? It was declared that you are a Brahmin from birth, but you have to become Brahmin. This is what I am trying to tell you.\n\nNow, please understand that whatever wrong imaginations we have regarding religion need to be corrected. If we don\'t do that, we will never attain our true religion; like Krishna said, \xe2\x80\x9cKill him.\xe2\x80\x9d We have to recognise and achieve the truth. This will remove all the other religions from inside us, and the true and only religion will be established in the whole world, because ultimately, everyone has said the same thing.\n\nAs far as the chakras on the forehead are concerned, Buddha, Mahavira and Jesus Christ came on these chakras, and their lives were full of penance. Also, in the Veda, seven phases of humans are mentioned: "bhu", meaning Shri Ganesha, made out of the earth element; "bhurv", meaning Shri Brahmadeva, made out of the sky element; "bhur bhuvas swaha". Swaha takes place in the Nabhi Chakra where we eat; that is, "agni", or fire, eats everything. This is the place of Lakshmi Narayan, bhur, buva swaha. "Mana" is the place of Maa Jagdamba. "Jana" Is the place of Shri Krishna where he thought of awakening the human awareness. Not only that, but Shri Krishna is also Virat. The entire body part of the whole humanity is inside him. And "tap", meaning penance done by Jesus, Mahavira and Buddha. And in Sahastrara there is absolute truth which is given to you by Shri Adi Shakti. The same essence mentioned in the Vedas was written by different people in Bhakti Marga by describing deities. All these are true. The only thing is that all these parts are scattered, and people fight to own one hand here and another there. So, this way both the hands are broken. The fight for the form and the formless also is a total waste. Now you all stand on the truth, and you will realise how there is form in the formless, and formless in the form. But you should say, \xe2\x80\x9cMother, we will accept only the truth and know only the truth.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nToday, I have told you a little bit about the chakras. I may have to say a lot about Sahastrara, but since there is less time, I will tell you about the spirit. The spirit, which is inside us, is the reflection of God, whom we call Sada Shiva. He is Sada Shiva, who never incarnates. His reflection inside us is the spirit. And his power of Desire, whom we call Adi Shakti, is in the form of Kundalini within us. When the spirit and the Kundalini unite, then our union with the Divine takes place. This is not an event for which any certificate can be given, or you can stick a label on your head to show that you are Self-realized. When this union takes place, the enlightenment of the spirit comes into your attention, like the Doctor Sahib said just now that as soon as Shri Mataji comes before you, She knows everything about you. When My attention is enlightened, obviously, I will know everything about you. If My enlightened attention is all around, I will know what you are. When your attention gets enlightened, then you will also recognize the truth.\n\nA person may be a very good orator, may give very good lectures, and can be melodramatic also, and people might be behind him saying, "Gurumaharaj, Gurumaharaj," but finally you will discover that he was released from jail only ten months before. This kind of incident you may witness on an everyday basis.\n\nPlease come inside so that others do not get disturbed. Tell the children also that there is no need to peep.\n\nLike a babaji comes today and he takes away all your money. Another comes tomorrow and runs away with your wealth. Nowadays, these babajis pop up everywhere, like frogs during the rainy season. Whichever village I go to, I see these new, new babajis.\n\nSo, only the spirit can tell you if a person is genuine or a cheat, because the spirit is absolute. There are not two opinions about this. Like if we see a person, we may not voice it but in our hearts, but we will know what he is, and whatever we know will be the absolute truth. You may ask how is that possible. It is possible because you are a spirit, and spirit knows only the absolute truth. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have wrong knowledge, and in the absolute knowledge the spirit will tell you that is a fact. The whole truth will be in front of you. In the beginning, you may have to observe on your fingers and find out which chakra is catching in the person, what is his problem, and where is the catch, but ultimately, you will become such an expert that the moment you see a person, you will instantly know his problems. Although many people may deny that they have a guru, the feeling in his Nabhi will make you say, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, you have a guru. Tell me his name, so that you can get cured faster," but they will never accept. They are wasting their time and also My time. I have to work for the emancipation of whole world, but people get stuck with small issues. Why can\xe2\x80\x99t they get rid of the false gurus?\n\nSo, when you start recognising the truth, you are surprised to find so many defects inside you. Like I was talking to a girl today and I told her, \xe2\x80\x9cYou are such a young girl, and you have problems in your liver.\xe2\x80\x9d People who think too much get liver problems. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you eat plenty of fried items?\xe2\x80\x9d The girl said, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I don\xe2\x80\x99t like them at all. I have had this problem since my birth.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cDoes your mother drink alcohol?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNo, not my mother. My father drinks alcohol.\xe2\x80\x9d So I concluded that a drunkard\'s child is born with a damaged liver. So, you have given your child a damaged liver from the beginning, and as soon as a child is born, he will get jaundice. If the father\'s or mother\'s liver is damaged, then the child also is born with a damaged liver.\n\nSo, to know the truth we should keep our attention pure. This doesn\'t mean that you start washing your attention. When you meditate, and when the Kundalini rises above Agnya Chakra, you become thoughtless. We should keep increasing this period of thoughtlessness, which is called as vlamb. That brings peacefulness inside you. When you are peaceful, only then does the tree grow. The tree inside you grows in your thoughtlessness, and you ascend. You will know all kinds of truth. Leave about Me, I know everything anyway, but Sahaja yogis also tell Me, \xe2\x80\x9cMother, we don\'t know how, but we know that if we go to this particular shop, we will get what we want, and that is what happens. We felt that we should take this path, and found a Sahaja yogi who said, \xe2\x80\x98I was waiting for you, as one of my relatives is ill\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d So many big and small things like this happen, and it surprises us. You know the truth by its roots. For example, if the leaves of a tree are damaged, you don\'t treat the leaves. Instead, you have to get to the root and treat it. In the same way, first of all, you realise the truth on your fingertips. The knowledge of the whole Veda comes inside you, and you know the truth. The knowledge of the whole world comes inside you.\n\nRecently, I went to Maharashtra. I had to travel by bullock cart. I started talking to the person who was riding the cart, and I said, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is Kabira who is riding.\xe2\x80\x9d I asked him, \xe2\x80\x9cHow did you know so many things?\xe2\x80\x9d He said, \xe2\x80\x9cMother, all this was inside me. You enlightened me, and I knew everything. Am I not right?\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou are absolutely correct. Hats off to you.\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nWhich university did Tukaram attend? Which university did Gyaneshwaraji attend? They were not incarnations, but then how did they acquire so much knowledge? This is the absolute knowledge, which is inside us, and which we attain after Self-realization. This is the enlightenment of your spirit, which makes you see the snake as a snake and not as a rope. So, this is the truth. Our spiritual attention is also collective. You are part and parcel of the Virat, but these body parts do not know that they are inside the Virat. But as soon as your spirit enlightens, the parts of your body know, \xe2\x80\x9cI am roaming inside Virat\xe2\x80\x9d. His collective consciousness gets enlightened. When a person\'s spirit gets enlightened, his attention becomes collective. An enlightened person\xe2\x80\x99s attention is collective, meaning that it tells you your problems and also others\xe2\x80\x99 problems. And if you know how to cure yourself, that also happens.\n\nIn Sahaja Yoga you get the total knowledge. So, consider that if you go to a doctor, he will say, \xe2\x80\x9cI am a gastro doctor. So please go to a dentist.\xe2\x80\x9d The dentist will take out all your teeth and say, \xe2\x80\x9cYour teeth are all right. So please go to an ear specialist.\xe2\x80\x9d He will tear your ears, and then say, \xe2\x80\x9cYour ears are fine. Please go to an eye specialist\xe2\x80\x9d. He will remove your eyes, and finally you will come back totally sick. All the doctors, please forgive Me. But in Sahaja Yoga the knowledge is aggregated. If a person comes and says, \xe2\x80\x9cMother, my stomach is aching,\xe2\x80\x9d then someone will say, \xe2\x80\x9cGive him medicine for a stomach ache.\xe2\x80\x9d But no, some entity has come inside his stomach, and the entity has to be removed. This is the effect of some other person, and needs to be removed. This is some black magic which needs to be removed. Not that you go to a psychiatrist for this and so on. These are small children, and they do not know anything yet. The whole total knowledge comes inside you in Sahaja Yoga. Even the children know the absolute knowledge.\n\nI have a grandchild who went to Ladakh with her parents when she was very small. There was a lama sitting over there. All these lamajis also are damajis. All are one and the same. This young girl was looking at him. Everyone was touching his feet. So, her parents thought they should do the same and went to touch his feet. The child got angry when the parents touched his feet. She went and stood in front of him and said, \xe2\x80\x9cJust by shaving your head and wearing this long robe, you don\'t become a realized soul. Why are you making others touch your feet? Get down off the stage.\xe2\x80\x9d A five-year-old child said this boldly.\n\nThere was some Prakhandanandini, Pakhandanand, or someone. I was invited as a chief guest, for the 100th birthday of a great Maharishi from South India. This Pakhandanand was also on the stage wearing a long maxi-like robe. My other grand-daughter was sitting in the front row. She said, \xe2\x80\x9cGrandma, ask this man in the maxi to go away. We are getting scorching heat from this person. We are all burning.\xe2\x80\x9d There were many other Sahaja yogis there, who started laughing. Even small children emerge as mighty scholars. The reason is that their attention is enlightened by their spirit.\n\nThe biggest reward given to you by the Divine is that your physical condition, mental condition and also financial state improve, and after all this you experience the prime thing, the absolute joy, which is Niranand. There is no happiness or sadness in joy. Joy is absolute. You cannot experience this without Self-realization. Very innocent people immediately achieve this. Intelligent people keep exploring, saying \xe2\x80\x9cMother, what is happening in this finger, and that finger?\xe2\x80\x9d whereas other people say, \xe2\x80\x9cMother, we are swimming in the ocean of joy,\xe2\x80\x9d and they learn the whole knowledge by themselves. Thus, a state of pure happiness, joy and pleasure is very clearly visible in our character, and people get surprised to see the total transformation, which makes them say, \xe2\x80\x9cOh my God! This man has touched the heights, and he has become a diamond from an ordinary stone.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nToday, the blossom time has come when many more flowers are going to bloom. That is why this work is happening at this particular time. It is a matter of time. This is the time when you also should bloom and achieve your rewards. Whatever is your notion, and whatever you are thinking, has to be changed by you, and you have to recognise the Divine. You have to change and recognise the Divine. Leave all your notions aside and witness the whole thing with your eyes open with the perception of a scientist. May God bless you all.\n\n2-nd translation of SHRI MATAJI\'S speech\n\nI bow to all the seekers of Jaipur. A person can only be considered a Sadhaka\n(seeker), if he has a desire or longing for\nsome pure knowledge. A person who has no desire for union with the\ndivine; but only entertains himself with listening to bhajans; visits temples,\ngoes on pilgrimages, and spends his lifetime in such pursuits, does not acquire\nany union with the Divine. You must\nachieve such a state, that will give you connection with the Divine. In order to achieve this connection, a very\nbeautiful instrument has been created within us, from the beginning, by the\nParamatma (God Almighty). The only thing\nrequired to be done, is to start using this instrument. Inside us, the subtle chakras (plexuses) that\nare there, are built in such a way, that within each chakra there presides one\nDevata (aspect of God).\n\nWe worship Ganapati, but we do not know\nthat He actually exists within us. We\nworship Shri Vishnu. We worship both\nShree Lakshmi and Vishnu, but we are not aware of the fact that they reside\nwithin us. Now the Jagaddamba, whose\nbhajan we just heard, is also enthroned within us. \n\nYesterday I told you about Nabhi\nChakra. When Shri Brahma completed the\ncreation, all around the Nabhi was formed the Bhavasagar. And to establish the dharmas (codes of\nconduct) within us, many divine personalities, starting with Adi Guru\nDattatreya, took their birth, and established the ten tattwas (location of\nprinciples or commandments) around the Bhavasagar. These ten tattwas , mould or give form to the\nvalencies of a human being. Just like carbon has four valencies, a human being\nhas ten valencies. And these Gurus\ncreated and established the codes of conduct; and we have to obey and follow\nthem.\n\nBut human beings, by their ego, or under\nthe influence of wrong interpretation and understanding; make dharma into\nadharma (anti). That is why we see so\nmuch distortion of dharma; and we start thinking that there is no such thing as\ndharma, and there is no such person as paramatma. Dharma verily exists within us. And we have been able to see the\ndemonstration or actualisation of it in the form of the various incarnations. Like one form of Dharma is shown by Shri\nRama. Shri Rama belonged to the very\ndistinguished Suryavansh clan (Sun Dynasty).\nHe was offered some berries by a low caste tribal woman, who had tasted\neach berry to ensure they were sweet, before offering them. He not only accepted them graciously, but\nalso ate them with enthusiasm. By this\naction he demonstrated a very great dharma, that for God, the love of His\ndevotee is of the greatest importance.\nThe human being who does not have any love in his heart can never aspire\nto reach the doors of the Divine abode.\nAnd the devotee whose heart is full of love, for him the doors of heaven\nare open, and God Himself comes and embraces the devotee to His heart. Similarly, when Sudama took a simple bundle\nof parched rice to Shri Krishna, He ate it with great love and relish.\n\nWe practise a lot of discrimination and\nfuss in matters of food offered to us.\nWe never stop to think that the person who cooked or prepared the food\nwith love, no matter from which strata of society he comes, that loving\npersonality, is the embodiment of the dharma of Love, and the personification of\nthe Paramatma Himself. So the\npersonifaction of Dharma is Love. \n\nBut today, fighting is going one between\none dharma (religion) and another. And\nanyone might ask \xe2\x80\x9cMother, why is there so much fighting between religious\ngroups?\xe2\x80\x9d In this world, all the Satgurus\n(real gurus) who came on earth, were\nflowers on the same tree, blossoming during different seasons. They came on the One Tree of Life, and taught\nthe same things. But we started plucking\nthese flowers and claiming this is mine, and that is mine; all after the incarnations left the\nearth. While they were here we ignored\nand troubled them; or passively watched others torturing them. All the saints and holy men were tortured,\nand when they were being troubled by others, we never stood up and defended\nthem; nor did we question why they were being tortured and killed. No one even offered them a glass of\nwater. These saints and holy men were\nflowers on the Tree of Life. But now we\nare laying claims to them, that this is ours, and that is ours. And mine is greater than yours. But all these flowers are dead. We are taking these dead things and fighting\namongst ourselves. The same flowers that\nadorned the divine creation, have now become the causal of religious wars and\nfights. \n\nSo the real Dharma or religion is that of love; because verily the\nEnergy of God works only on Love. If God\ndid not love us He would not have created this universe. But we do not love ourselves. We are confused. We imprison ourselves and we\nbind ourselves with our own faulty ideas, that this is how it is to be\ndone; or this is my view or idea; and\nthis is the truth; and I am right. So just like\nthese kinds of ideas that we accept as truth, and bind ourselves; others\nalso imprison themselves inside their ideas and beliefs. \n\nBut in love, a person becomes free. He begins to find within himself the tantra\n(instrument) of Swa (Self). There\nresides the true Love. \n\nThere was a time once, when even violence\nhad to be resorted to. Like Shri Krishna\ntold Arjun on the battlefield, \xe2\x80\x9cThese people that you see, are already\ndead. Take up arms and kill them\xe2\x80\x9d. He did not teach the violence of modern times,\nwhere you fight to save the lives of worms and insects. Am I expected to raise the Kundalini of the\nworms and insects that you are protecting?\nShri Krishna said \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9cKill all of them.\nEven your guru has to be killed!\xe2\x80\x9d\nWe must try to understand the dharma of that, in a complete way.\n\nDo you know the story of Karn. His feet were entangled in his chariot, and\nArjun raised his bow. Karn said \xe2\x80\x9cLook, I\nam a warrior and you are a warrior, and if a warrior is unarmed, you cannot\nattack him\xe2\x80\x9d. Shri Krishna pointed a\nfinger at him and asked him, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen Draupadi was being abused and disrobed,\nwhere was your warrior\xe2\x80\x99s bravery? Kill\nhim, Arjun!\xe2\x80\x9d He did not teach him\nnon-violence! He taught the destruction\nof corrupt and wicked people. \n\nBut we people practise non-violence for\ncorrupt people, and violence against honest and righteous people. Among us there are many who protects bugs and\ninsects; but if we have to recover debts from a man, we do not mind putting his\nwife and children on the streets. If we\nhave to insult and disgrace him, we will do so; even if we know that he is the\nonly bread earner of his family. This is\nnot Dharma. It is adharma (against\ndharma). \n\nThe interpretation and meaning of Dharma,\nwe have to learn from the incarnations.\nThey came in our lifetime to establish the qualities of the chakras\nwithin us. And not only this, but they\ndemonstrated by examples, which we\nshould try to understand. \n\nNow the next Chakra after dharma, is the\nChakra of Shree Jagaddamba, which was worshipped in a bhajan just now. Shree Jagaddamba is enthroned in the center\nof the Heart. This chakra comprises of\n12 petals. Up to the age of 12, Shree\nJagaddamba, whose one name is also Bhramarambha (creator of antibodies),\ncreates these Bhramars (antibodies) in the Sternum bone, which is called\nantibodies in English. She creates and\ngets them ready by the age of 12. If any\nchild is attacked by any disease, these Bhramars fight and destroy the\nattacking entities. After the age of 12,\nthese antibodies spread throughout the body.\nAnd just like our All India Radio, this sternum bone sends signals to\nthe antibodies all over our body to go into formation and destroy the\nattackers. These antibodies destroy all\nattacks and invasions from negative forces.\nAnd sometimes they also get struck down.\n\nWomen suffer more from these attacks,\nbecause they do not have the confidence\nthat Shree Jagaddamba is our Mother, and She is all powerful. This great Shakti, Who cares for all,\nnourishes and protects, is our Mother, Shree Jagaddamba. If\nthe husband threatens or scolds her, she becomes timid and frightened, and\ncowers down. In our country, where brave\nwomen like Padmini were produced, they should serve as examples to our\nwomen. In history they are very much\nexisting. But today\xe2\x80\x99s women who are\nfrightened and timid, the men suppress them more than necessary. And do not care for them. In such circumstances this heart chakra gets\naffected, and usually causes breast cancer.\n\nThis chakra even gets caught up in\nmen. When this happens they become\ntimid, and become afraid of little, little things. The hands and feet start trembling, and\nwhatever he tries to do, he is always afraid.\nJagaddamba is the Shakti. Just\nlook here how She is seated in the middle of the heart. When the saintly people rise from the\nBhavasagar and travel towards the heart, She protects and guides them, and\nhelps them, and lifts them higher. \n\nYou know very well that the Devi took many\nincarnations on this earth. Even in your\nRajasthan She came as Sati Devi and stayed for a very short time, and in that\nshort time She demonstrated Her Shakti.\nAll the rulers and kings of this place worshipped the Shakti. Inspite of this, there is a kind of fear in\nthe hearts of the people here. Satya, (the truth) should not cause any\nfear. The person who stands on the truth\ndoes not fear anyone. He stands before\nthe whole world and defends the truth. \n\nIn 1970, in the famous Jehangir Cawasji\nHall, I publicly pronounced the names of each and every rakshasa (demon) and\ndevil who had taken birth on this earth, and who they were in their original\nform. I named them all, one by one. And not a single person made a case against\nMe, nor did anyone try to attack Me. One\ndevotee said, \xe2\x80\x9cShree Mataji, these are dangerous people and they will shoot You\nor harm You.\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cBring one such\nperson before Me and I will see what he can do.\xe2\x80\x9d They will start trembling and shaking before\nMe. Even after seeing this great Shakti,\nwho is our Mother, we are still afraid and cowardly. One of the reasons could be that we do not\nknow the meaning of bravery and heroism.\nWe have not understood the meaning of valour. And we did not honour the truth. Those who walk on the path of untruth are\ncowardly. The Mother only recognises\nthose who tread the path of truth. She\nonly adorns and protects them. And we\nrealise that within us exists Shree Jagaddamba, and we are going to awaken all\nHer powers within us. Many ailments are\ncaused due to weakness of the Jagaddamba tattwa. \n\nThe Chakra which you see on the right side,\nis what we call as Right Heart. This\nchakra gets caught a lot in Rajasthan. It is the Chakra of Shri Rama. Shri Rama is the Purushottam (foremost among\nmen). Those who are afraid of political\nmatters get caught on this chakra, very often.\nShri Rama was an exemplary King.\nThey should worship Him. Why\nshould they be afraid of any government.\nWhen He reigns here, what is the cause to be afraid of the\ngovernment. He was Maryada Purushottam (most honourable and dignified), and in the\nsame way if you live within the boundaries of good conduct, no government can\ntouch you. And He is all powerful to\nprotect you in every way.\n\nWhen this chakra gets caught, a person gets\nasthma. This is the chakra of the\nFather, because Shri Rama is the embodiment of Fatherhood. If any child has problems with the father; or\nthe father has problems with the child; or if there is no father, like in\nchildhood the father dies, or there is any problem of the father, or the father\nis teaching the child wrong things, then this chakra gets caught. And with that you develop asthma. This can be cured. But this does not mean that you bring all\nasthma patients to Me! \n\nIt means that first you get your Kundalini\nawakening, and then set right this chakra.\nWhen the Kundalini rises \xe2\x80\x93 some people have a beautiful Kundalini. She rises and takes Her place in a\nsecond. And after that they just do not\nget any illnesses or problems. This is\none kind of kundalini.\n\nAfter this there are some people whose\nKundalini rises, but keeps falling again and again. Such people should raise their kundalinis\nagain and again, because the injection of Kundalini is your medicine; is your\ncure. She is your doctor. She is your caretaker. She is your everything. If this shakti does not flow within you, then\nMy Hands cannot work anything. \n\nAnd then there is the third kind, whose\nKundalini is frozen. She just does not\nrise. It is difficult to set right this\nkind of a person. Those who have\nShraddha, faith and who say that yes, there has been some change in me,\nsomething is happening, in such people\nthe Kundalini starts working. There are\nmany. I have set right their problems, I\nhave cured many. I have seen that out of\nthis lot very few people settle down into Sahaja Yoga.\n\nWe should realise that why should I\nenlighten such lamps who are not going to give light. What is the use of lighting such lamps which\nhave only come here to improve their health or get cured. Lots of wrestlers who are healthy, come to Me\nand ask Me, Shree Mataji please give us peace.\nIf your health improves, will everything else get alright? One chakra will get alright, then the other\nchakra will become affected. Today you\nwill get one disease, and tomorrow something else will happen to you. Is this\nMy job from morning till night. One\nrequirement is worthiness, and the other is humility. Many people are of the impression that by\ncoming into Sahaja Yoga they are doing a big favour or obliging Me. They don\xe2\x80\x99t realise that this is their great\ngood fortune that today I came, and my kundalini got awakened, and I achieved\nthis great happening. It is only when a\nhuman being realises this fact, that God accepts him. But man has so much ego that he thinks he has\nobliged Me by coming here. It is God\nthat has obliged me. We should be\ngrateful to Him. We should thank Him that,\nGod you gave me this opportunity to come here, to Your doorstep. \n\nThose who come only to cure their\nillnesses, My Attention just does not go to them! Yes, once the Kundalini is awakened, and once\nShe rises within you, then various kinds of illnesses, like what I told you\nyesterday, and other superficial problems, do get cured. But the Kundalini has to be established with\nsome practices. And of course it is true\nas Mrs. Pardhal said, she had angina and in ten minutes she got cured. But I know her entire family, and she is\ndifferent from all of them. What can I\ndo about this. Some fruits ripen and\nbecome sweet early; some take longer to ripen, and some get rotten before they\ncan get ripe. \n\nThose who come only to cure their\nillnesses, My Attention does not even go towards them. Of course, when the Kundalini rises, then all\nthe superficial illnesses like I told you yesterday, get cured. But we have to establish the Kundalini by\npractising Sahaja Yoga and learning the techniques. Mrs.Pardhal got cured in ten minutes. I know her entire family, but this soul is\ndifferent. What can I do. That is why it is important that Kundalini\nshould be awakened, and we should know where to take Her attention, which\nchakra is having a problem, how to take Her Attention to it, and whatever\nadvice sahaja yogis give, we should follow that faithfully. All this has to be understood.\n\nNow, above this chakra, at the base of the\nthroat, is the chakra which we call as Shri Krishna\xe2\x80\x99s Chakra. This is the Krishna who played with the gopas\nand gopis (young people of the cow herd community). This chakra is situated in the middle of the\nthroat. But nowadays there are funny\npeople who claim that the Shri Krishna who gave us the Gita is different, and\nthe Shri Krishna who played with the gopas and gopis is different. \n\nThis Chakra in the throat has sixteen\npetals. It is called Vishuddhi, which\nmeans stainless and pure, because He was absolutely Vishuddh (sinless), as He\nis Yogeshwara. Nothing impure can stick\nto Yogeshwara. That you are well aware\nof. He is Yogeshwara, and a perfectly\nvishuddh (pure) atma. And when you reach\nthe state of Vishuddhi everything looks\nlike a play. And you become a witness\nand watch the play. Nothing affects you,\nwhen you become a sakshi (witness), and watch.\nIn this new state you know it is all a play. Because as long as you were in the Bhavasagar\n(ocean of illusion), you saw all the dangers around you. But now you have got into the boat and you\nare safely watching. You come into a\nwitness state. When you come into this\nstate, you just become a witness and watch without reacting. And nothing disturbs you. \n\nThe second thing is that for all the\nquestions that you had, the solutions start coming once you get out of it. As long as you are involved into your\nproblems there cannot be any solutions.\nIt is only when you come out of it, the questions can be resolved. So this place here, on the throat, which is\nthe place of Shri Krishna, this also has two parts. You can say, the left side and the right\nside. \n\nThe left side is the place of Vishnumaya. You know about Shri Vishnumaya who was the sister of Shri Krishna, who went up into the heavens and made a divine announcement (Akashvani). She announced to Kansa that the one who has come to destroy you, is still alive. That same Akashvani works even now, as lightning waves. You will see that in My photographs these waves of light show up in amazing ways. And this camera which we consider as a normal instrument, it captures such photos of Mine that you will be surprised. It has even taken pictures of My face in the clouds. This is the work of Akashvani. That is the power of Vishnumaya.\n\nRegarding Vishnumaya I have to tell you\nthat there is no proper understanding of the relationship of brother and\nsister. When there is no virtue and\npurity (shuchita) inside us. When we put\nour impure eyes on other women, then this chakra gets caught. Or if we keep feeling guilty that we are\nsinners, we have made mistakes; or unnecessarily blaming ourselves, then also\nthis chakra catches. Because there are\nsome pompous people who come and tell you that you are sinners, you have done\nwrong, this world is wicked, etc.. And\nwho is that person who feels that he is a great saint or dharamatma (saintly\nsoul). By constantly hearing this kind\nof talk, people sink low in their own estimation, and this gives a catch on\ntheir left Vishuddhi, and together with this catch, if the heart Chakra also\ngets disturbed, then one can get the dangerous condition of Angina.\n\nIn our society, it is the woman who is\nalways blamed by the family, by the husband, or by anyone, that you are not\ngood. That you are bad. This has an effect of disturbing the left\nVishuddhi, and many ailments can happen, especially angina. \n\nNow, on the right side there resides, as we\ncall in Marathi as Vitthala, or which you call as the King of Dwaraka, Shri\nKrishna. When He played with the gopas\nand gopis , His place in the Vishuddhi was in the Center Vishuddhi; and when He\nruled in Dwaraka as the King, then He took His place on the Right Vishuddhi. And on the left, His Shakti, which was in the\nform of the female energy, came as His sister, Vishnumaya. In the center, His Shakti came as Radha, and\non the right side, His Shakti came as His wife Rukmini. As I told you He has five Shaktis; plus 16000\nShaktis in this Vitthal area. The right\nVishuddhi is the place of Vitthala. But\neven here there are so many distortions.\nThe murthy (form or image) of Vitthala is in Pandharpur. He manifests there, just as you have a\nswayambhu here. \n\nAfter this manifestation, the people\nstarted their usual business there. For\na whole month they keep tobacco in the mouth, and keep chanting \xe2\x80\x9cVitthala,\nVitthala!\xe2\x80\x9d and go walking for miles, towards the temple. Now this tobacco is totally against Shri\nKrishna. He does not like tobacco at\nall. Those who eat tobacco, this chakra\nof theirs gets spoilt, and those who smoke tobacco, also spoil this chakra, and\nend up with cancer. The treatment for\nthis is to take inhalation of ajwain smoke (carrom seeds). Make a roll of dried ajwain leaves and smoke\nthat. Shri Krishna becomes pleased with\nthis. \n\nThe second treatment is to float a small\nblob of butter on a cup of hot milk or hot water, and drink this. Butter is the favorite of Shri Krishna. Put a few drops of melted ghee in your\nnose. Ghee and a little camphor, because\nHe also likes the smell of camphor. So\nadd a little camphor in the hot ghee, put it in a bottle, and use it for your\nnose. Rub some camphor on your\nforehead. If you do whatever Shri\nKrishna likes, he becomes pleased, and your Vishuddhi gets alright. Your cancer can be cured. All your other problems can be cured. Because when your throat gets caught, My\nthroat also gets caught. And I have to\nspend a lot of time and effort to make it alright. \n\nSome people\xe2\x80\x99s Kundalini is like a mountain,\nand just cannot be raised. It requires\na lot of effort. In the Vishuddhi there\nare three coils or twists sitting. The\nleft vishuddhi gets badly caught if you have taken wrong mantras from false\ngurus, and are chanting them from morning till night. Now for all these problems there are solutions\nin Sahaja Yoga. There is a mantra for\nevery problem; there are also other\nmethods, like using water, fire and other elements, or things like vibrated\nsugar, salt, etc.. \n\nNow the Agya Chakra is in the middle of the\nforehead. This is the seat of Maha\nVishnu, and a description of this has been beautifully given by Markandeya in\nthe Devi Mahatmyam. But who reads Devi\nMahatmyam in these times. This is the\nplace of Mahavishnu. And here and here\n(left and right) these two places, we have Buddha on the left side, and\nMahavira on the right side. \n\nNow, even in the case of Buddha, people\nhave spoilt the name of Buddha. He had\nsaid, do not talk about God first. Don\xe2\x80\x99t\ntalk about God, and not even His images, because until one gets realisation we\ncannot say what kinds of objects people will start worshipping. If they see a stone, they will start\nworshipping it. How can one know which\nstone is to be worshipped and which is not.\nThat is why he said: Get your realisation! Realisation! Realisation! Get this knowledge first. That is why people started saying that He is\ntalking like an atheist. That is not\nso. He was a very practical person. In the beginning even I said \xe2\x80\x93 First get your\nrealisation and then we can talk. Like\nyou saw yesterday, one person announced that he did not want realisation. Then why did he come here. Here there is only one activity, and that is\ngetting your self realisation. Nothing\nelse. This is what Buddha said. Get your realisation first. But what he said was, do not perform any\npujas and worship, but just get your realisation. Receive it.\nBut they started creating funny kinds of practices, and started\nfollowing the falsehood and pretence. \n\nWhat can we say about Mahavirji. He was Sakshat (verily) Shri\nBhairavnath. A very great person. One day he was meditating in the forest, and\nwhen he was returning to his palace, half of his robe got caught in a protruding\nbranch, and it got removed from his body.\nNow don\xe2\x80\x99t misunderstand Me. Things\nwhich are wrong upset Me greatly. I have\nbeen greatly upset, because He was My son.\nSo since half of his dress got torn, he was returning with only half the\ncloth on his body. Shri Krishna Himself,\nin the form of a devotee, put him to the test.\nHe said, you are a great auliya\n(holy person) and you are an avadoot (ascetic).\nYour need is not so great as mine.\nSee, I have nothing to wear. I am\nunclad. So he removed the remaining\ncloth and gave it to him for a moment.\nHe was a prince, and lived a royal life.\nFor just one moment he was without any clothes; and he quickly entered\nhis palace. Now this incident has been\nwrongly used, out of proportion, by the people, and this pains Me. Ask a mother how she feels. Is this the way he is to be disrespected! They keep parading his unclad form all over\nthe world. And some of them even walk\nnaked on the roads, insulting the name of this great deity. Is this what Mahavir taught. First you become like Mahavir and then we\nwill see. I get so sad and upset, that\nsometimes I feel the sins committed by these people is too great to be washed\naway. Those who have openly insulted this great incarnation by making vulgar\nimages in stone, cement, and whatever they could get, how can God forgive such\npeople. \n\nNeminath was a cousin of Shri Krishna \xe2\x80\x93\n(His father\xe2\x80\x99s brother\xe2\x80\x99s son). During his\nmarriage, for the feast, many animals and birds were brought to be killed. When he saw this he was filled with\naversion. It happens sometimes. So he made a declaration that he would never\nbe a party to cruelty to anyone or anything.\nBut now people are even protecting worms and bugs. Is this what he meant we should do. From where to where people can misrepresent\nand misinterpret situations. At least we\nshould try to learn the truth of what was spoken by these great souls. \n\nI have spoken to a lot of Jain ascetics and\nasked them \xe2\x80\x93 Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you meditate in the way that Mahavira has taught,\ninstead of building temples. So they\ntold Me, Mother if we do a lot of meditation we get shudra siddhis (low level\npowers). So I told them, come into\nSahaja Yoga and we will teach you the right way to Meditate. It is only now that the Jain community has\nunderstood that whatever Mahavirji taught, the same thig is being taught by\nShree Mataji. And whatever Buddha\ntaught, that also Shree Mataji is teaching here. And it is not advisable to waste ones money\nand attention on useless things.\n\nAnd the third great incarnation was Issa\nMasih (Jesus Christ). You can say that\nwe wear the blood of Christ here on the forehead. Now what can I say about the stupidity of the\nChristians. They are so ill informed,\nthat one cannot reason with them. They\nare dogmatic and stubborn. We think that\nMuslims are dogmatic. But these people\nare the most ignorant, stubborn and dogmatic.\nThey have never really understood Christ. Christ is placed on the forehead, here, on\nthe optic chiasma. And that is why He\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cThou shalt not have adulterous eyes!\xe2\x80\x9d.\nThat your eyes should be innocent and pure. That no kind of lust should be there. Can anyone find a Christian with this\nquality. In whose eyes there is no lust\nor greed. One quality that He emphasised\nthe most, that quality is not there.\nEverywhere the situation is the same.\n\nWe have been taught one thing, that the\nSpirit resides within all of us. But we\nhave made something else out of it. We\nhave made the Caste System. Classifying\nthe caste of a person by the circumstance of his birth, is absolutely\nwrong. If this system is right, then\nVyasji could never have written the Holy Books.\nThose who know, are fully aware of the circumstance of his birth. What do you know. He was the son of Matsyagandha, a woman of\nthe fisherman community. And she was not\neven married! So how could Vyasji have\nwritten that birth determines caste. But\npeople have decided that if you are born in a brahmin home, you are a\nbrahmin. You have to become a\nbrahmin. That is what I am trying to\nexplain to you. \n\nNow we have to decide that all the mistaken\nnotions that we have about Dharma (religion) have to be corrected. If we do not understand and accept the truth\nas it is, we cannot be accepted as dharmic (righteous) people. Like Shri Krishna said, Kill them. They are already dead!\xe2\x80\x9d It is like that. Whatever is the truth, we have to attain\nthat. We have to accept that. Only then all the false ideas of religion\nwill go away. And the one, real\nreligion, will be established, and all of us will belong to it. Because all of those who came said one and\nthe same thing.\n\nNow the three chakras that I told you\nabout, are here on the forehead \xe2\x80\x93 Buddha, Mahavira and Issa Masih (Jesus\nChrist). These three came, and their\nlives were one of Tapasya (austerity).\nNow in the Vedas our seven stithis (states) have been described. Bhu \xe2\x80\x93 Bhu means the earth. Shri Ganesha is made out of the earth. Bhurva \xe2\x80\x93 means Antariksh (firmament, space). Shri Brahmadev made\nthis Antariksh. It only means the\ntattwa (the elemen (((t, the principle).\nBhu, Bhurva, Swaha! Swaha is on\nthe Nabhi Chakra. Where we eat\neverything; where the fire consumes.\nThis is the seat of Lakshmi Narayan.\nBhu, Bhurva, Swaha. \n\nMana, this Mana, the place of Ma, is the\nplace of Jagaddamba. Jana,\nVishuddhi. Jana becomes Shri\nKrishna. Awakened concept of Jana is\ncollectivity. He descended among the\nJana. He was verily Viraat. Shri Krishna is sakshat Viraat. Every cell and limb of the creation is within\nHim. He is the Collective Body. \n\nAnd then Tapa (austerity).\xc2\xa0 All three of these did Tapa.\xc2\xa0 And finally, on the crown , Sahastrara, is the Satya (Truth).\xc2\xa0 The truth given by Adi Shakti.\xc2\xa0 In this way, all the Tattwas (elements or principles) that are mentioned, the same thing is in a Vishad (clear, lucid) form in Bhakti Marg as described by the devas and devis, is the truth.\xc2\xa0 The absolute truth.\xc2\xa0 There is one limb on this side, and another limb on that side.\xc2\xa0 But that people would catch hold of one hand, and fight with the people holding the other hand, what should we make of this?\xc2\xa0 In this way both the hands will break, and in fact they have broken!\xc2\xa0 \n\nBut fighting between sakar and nirakar,\n(form and formless) is also pointless.\nAll of you come into sakar, and then you will understand how nirakar\nbecomes sakar, and how sakar becomes nirakar.\nThis is a point to be understood.\n\nBut I will do varnan (expound) Satya.\xc2\xa0 And apart from Satya, we are not going to accept anything else.\xc2\xa0 Today I have told you as much as possible about the Chakras.\xc2\xa0 To explain Sahastrara will require a lot of time.\xc2\xa0 So today I will tell you something about the Atma (Spirit).\xc2\xa0 \n\nThe Atma resides within us. And many people call it the reflection of\nwhat we call as Sadashiva (God Almighty).\nSadashiva never takes an incarnation.\nHis reflection within us is called as Atma. And His Shakti (energy) which is His Desire,\nis called as Adi Shakti. Her reflection\nwithin us, is the Kundalini. When the\nAtma comes into contact with the Kundalini, then we say that Yoga has taken\nplace. This is a happening which has to\ntake place. It is not just a saying, or\na certificate which is given to you that you are a realised soul. You cannot wear a label on your head saying\nthat I have become a realised soul. Or I\nam this, or I am that. No. When this self realisation happens, the light\nof the Spirit starts shining in your attention.\n\nAs soon as that light comes into your\nattention, just like Dr.Talwar told you just now, that as soon as Shree Mataji\nenters She knows all about each one of you.\nIf My attention is enlightened, then definitely I will know everything\nabout you. If My attention is all\nencompassing, and there is also light, then definitely I will be able to know\neverything about you. When your\nattention gets enlightened, then you will also know what is the truth. \n\nLike some person gives a very fiery speech,\nspeaks very powerfully, and does a lot of drama too, every one falls into his\ntrap and starts chanting Guru Maharaj, Guru Maharaj. Later on you will discover that only ten days\nago he was released from a jail. Ten\nmonths after that you will see this news.\n\n(Aside \xe2\x80\x93 You please come inside and sit\ndown, because movement disturbs the attention of the people. Tell the children also to come inside. No need to peep from outside.)\n\nSo these kinds of people you will meet\nalmost every day. Today one babaji will\ncome. Then tomorrow another will\ncome. They have taken so much money and\ngone. They have taken away so many of\nyour valuables. I really don\xe2\x80\x99t know how\nthey come. Just like, during monsoons we\nhave a lot of frogs croaking, in the same way these false gurus mushroom all\nover. Today I saw so many people\nadmitting that they are followers of this guru or that. Wherever I go, I hear about new babajis.\n\nSo it is only through your Atma that you\nwill be able to judge who is genuine and who is false. Because this is the complete Tattwa, which\nyou call as Absolute. There are no two\noptions. It is \xe2\x80\x9cKevalam\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 One, and only\nOne. We may not say it openly, but from inside we have been able to make the\nright judgement about a person. And whatever we feel, that is the truth. \n\nYou might ask, how is this possible. Because the one who knows is only the pure\nAtma, and is the pure knowledge. Only\npure knowledge. He does not know non knowledge.\nAnd in that pure knowledge, he will tell you that this is what it\nis. Means he is the embodiment of\ntruth. Before your eyes he will become\nverily the witness. \n\nIn the beginning you will have to use your\nhands, and the vibrations on your hands, to get the information as to what\nchakras are catching in a person, or what negativities are within him. But with constant practice you will become\nsuch an expert, that just by looking at someone, you will be able to judge the\ntruth. Many people will deny that, no we\ndo not have a guru, or we do not follow any guru. But the realised soul will feel that\nsomething in your void is having spasms.\nBut they will insist, no, we have no guru. But we have to coax them to tell the name, so\nthat they can be released from the catches of that guru. But they will not reveal the name. This is only wasting My time and their\ntime. I have so much work to do,\ninvolving the whole universe, and you are stuck in these small small\nthings. Why cant you get rid of\nthem. In this way when you become aware\nof your own truth, you get surprised that you can look within yourself, and\nwonder how did this negativity enter my being.\nFrom where did it come.\n\nI was speaking with a girl. I asked her why is your liver having a\nproblem, and you are so young. It is the\nperson who thinks too much who gets problems with the liver. Do you eat too much of fried foods. No, she said.\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t even like such food. It\nseems this has been with me from the time I was born. Did your mother consume alcohol? No, she said.\nMy mother never took alcohol. But\nmy father used to drink. I saw that if\nthe father is an alcoholic, then the child will be born with a bad liver. So you give such a boon to your child. The child gets a bad liver even before it is\nborn, and after it is born it gets jaundice.\nIf the father is an alcoholic; if the father\xe2\x80\x99s liver is bad, if the\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s liver is bad, the child will get a bad liver.\n\nSo to know the truth, we must keep our chitth (attention) clean.\xc2\xa0 This does not mean that you sit and wash your attention.\xc2\xa0 When you sit in meditation, and when your kundalini crosses the Agya and enters Sahastrara, you will become Nirvichar (thoughtless).\xc2\xa0 This space of thoughtlessness, between two thoughts, should be extended again and again, and lengthen the time of thoughtless awareness.\xc2\xa0 At that time your attention becomes peaceful.\xc2\xa0 You can see that when there is peace and quiet, then only a plant grows.\xc2\xa0 In this way, when you become Nirvichar, and you are in silence, then only your tree will grow. And there is progress.\xc2\xa0 You will know the truth about everything.\xc2\xa0 \n\nOf course, My case is different. But many sahaja yogis have also said, that\nShree Mataji we don\xe2\x80\x99t know how it happens, but we can feel that a particular\nshop will have what we need, and when we go in they have exactly what we\nrequire. And we get what we want. Also, something made us go in a particular\ndirection, and there a sahaja yogi was sitting and waiting for us, saying that\nI was waiting for you because one of my relations is sick and we need your\nhelp. Little little things here and\nthere, become into big events, and it is really surprising. And you will know the truth on its\ntattwa (principle). That where has the tattwa gone wrong. Like in a tree, if the leaves are getting\nspoilt, then you cannot cure it by attending to the leaves. You have to go down to the roots. The root of the problem. And then the tree gets alright.\n\nSo first of all you get the knowledge on\nyour finger tips. You get the vid, the\nknowledge, on your fingertips, and you know what is the problem and where it\nhas to be cured. Knowledge of the whole\nworld comes within you.\n\nOnce I was travelling in Maharashtra. There we have to sit in bullock carts. And when I started talking to the cart\ndriver, I thought, this is the great poet Kabir sitting here are driving a\nbullock cart. I asked him, how do you\nknow all this divine knowledge. He said,\n\xe2\x80\x9c Ma, this was already inside me. You\ngave me the light inside, and now I can see everything and know\neverything. Whatever I am saying is\nright, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it.\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cYes. It is so amazing that you are speaking so\nmuch of truth\xe2\x80\x9d. What university did\nTukaram attend. Which university did\nGyaneshwarji study in. Nor were they\nincarnations. But what knowledgeable\npeople they were. Where did this\nknowledge come from. All this knowledge,\nthis pure knowledge, which is within us, that is the knowledge that you also\nachieve. This is the light of the\nspirit, which when it starts burning, enlightens your attention and you can\nknow a snake from a snake, and a rope from a rope. There are innumerable such instances, but\nthere is no time now to go into that. \n\nSo\nthis is the truth. It is also the\nattention. Atma is the collective\nconsciousness. It is like, within the\nVirata\xe2\x80\x99s body, you are every cell inside.\nBut this cell is not aware that it is a part and parcel of the Virata\xe2\x80\x99s\nbody. When his atma is awakened, then he\nbecomes conscious of the fact that he is permeating the body of the Virat. His collective consciousness gets\nawakened. His attention becomes\ncollective. The person inside whom the\nlight of the spirit starts to shine, his attention becomes part of the\ncollective consciousness. It not only\ntells you what is wrong with yourself, because it has manifested inside you,\nbut it also makes you aware of the problems of others.\n\nAnd if you know the technique of curing the\nproblem, then that also becomes alright.\nThat is the whole Samagra Gyan (complete knowledge of the whole), not\ncompartmental. Like if you go to a\ndoctor and you have a problem in the stomach, he will send you to a\nDentist. He will remove all your teeth. Another doctor will tear your eardrums and\nsay now your ears are alright. The third\ndoctor will remove your eye and say now your eyes are alright. And in the end you come back really\nsick. Doctors in the audience, please\nexcuse Me! But in sahaja yoga you get\nsamagra gyan, meaning that someone comes and says \xe2\x80\x9cMa, there is a pain in my\nstomach. Give him medicine for the stomach\xe2\x80\x9d.\nBut this problem is not of the stomach.\nSome other entity has entered the stomach. That has to be removed. He is under the influence of someone\nelse. Some black magic has been\ndone. That has to be removed.\n\nSamagra gyan comes in sahaja yoga. Not this, that take him to some psychologist,\nor someone else. These are like\nchildren. Up to now they have known nothing. The absolute knowledge is within you, and\neven little, little children know all these things. Small, small children know this absolute\nknowledge. I have a grand daughter. When she was very small her father and mother\nhad gone to Ladakh, and there they met a Lamaji. Lamas will only be Lamas. So the Lama was sitting. They are all strange, one bigger than the\nother. How many names can one take. The girl was small. She looked at him. Everyone was touching his feet, so her\nparents felt it will look bad if they didn\xe2\x80\x99t also touch his feet. But this made the little girl angry. She looked up at him and said loudly \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9cIf\nyou shave your head and wear a Toga, you do not become a realised soul. Why are you making everyone touch your\nfeet.\xe2\x80\x9d She felt his bad vibrations, and\njust stood up and said \xe2\x80\x9cYou get down from there!\xe2\x80\x9d A five year old child told him off. \n\nThere is another one called\nPrachhanandji. And there was a very\ngreat Rishi \xe2\x80\x93 What was his name. A great soul from South of India. And for this Rishi there was a big function\nand we all went. There this Pakhanandji\nwas sitting, wearing a big Choga. My grand\ndaughter who was sitting in the front row, called out to Me. \xe2\x80\x9cNaani (Grandmother)! The one who is wearing\na maxi, chase him out. A lot of heat is\ncoming from him. We are all\nburning!\xe2\x80\x9d A lot of sahaja yogis were\nalso there, and they all started laughing.\n\nSuch great saints, these little, little\nones are produced. The reason is that\ntheir attention is enlightened with the light of the spirit. But the biggest gift of God is this, that\nyour bodily ailments get alright, your mental condition improves, and you get\nall the material benefits which makes you comfortably off. After all the arrangements are taken care of,\nthe greatest thing that you get is Anand (Joy).\nOnly Anand. You experience\nNiranand. In Anand there are no two\nthings like happiness and unhappiness.\nAnand is one, absolute. You cannot\nexperience that without the knowledge of the self. It is the simple minded, innocent people, who\ngrasp it immediately. While those who\nare intellectuals, get lost in asking questions, like why this finger, why\nthat. How to work it from here, and why\nin that way, etc..\n\nBut those who are simple and open hearted,\nthey are swimming in the ocean of joy.\nAnd get all their knowledge in a spontaneous way. In this way, the spirit which is the embodiment\nof Sat (truth) Chith (attention) Anand (joy), that manifests in their clean and\npure understanding; and people who see him, they are amazed that this man, O\nGod, from where to where he has reached.\nHow did this rough stone become a diamond. \n\nToday the time has come. This is verily the blossom time, when\ncountless, countless flowers are going to get transformed into fruit. All this is working out, because the time has\ncome. This is the time, and may all of\nyou transform from blossoms into fruit; and whatever merits and rewards you\nhave earned, you collect them now.\nWhatever you have imagined or believed in before is not God. Paramatma is paramatma (Almighty) and cannot\nbe changed. You will have to change your\nconcepts and understand the actual Paramatma . Leave aside your beliefs and expectations, and\nbehold the truth; just like a scientist accepts after the experiment gives\nproof. That what is this thing in\nreality, and see it in its true form. \n\nMay God Almighty bless you always.\n\nREALIZATION PROGRAM\n\nToday is the last day. I came here only for two days, but I see there are so many of my devotees. I thought it was going to be like the last time when many people were eating my head. So I thought it is better to go away in two days. Next time I will come for eight days. You people can also go to Delhi, where there is a 7-day program, in Barakhamba Road, Shankar Lal Hall, at 7 p.m. People come from Madras also. Jaipur people should definitely come. You know that many foreigners have come several thousand miles to come to this program. Three hundred and seventy foreigners had come. I bring only selected people, because it is very difficult to arrange their stay. Most of them have left. Very few who were remaining who have come to Jaipur.\n\nI had told you that if you have any questions, write them down and give them to Me, but no one has asked me any questions, which means no one has any questions. Now, it\'s a matter of experiencing. So today we will raise the Kundalini again and like yesterday we will also meditate today. Doctor has explained to you in the morning how you should improve your chakras and how you can keep yourself in Mother\'s shield. There are people who have many badhas or blocks. They should get rid of these badhas religiously and humbly. With effort, all kinds of diseases can be cured. Some people may need more time, some less. Mental diseases also can be cured. It is free of cost, but with effort and reverence it can be done. Getting Self-realization is effortless, but not for all. You must have noticed that some people get it after very hard work. The reason for this is there are many twists and turns in our lives. No problem; I have come here to work very hard with you.\n\nRemember one thing, that to collect money in the name of God is a great sin. It is all right if you contribute money for the construction of a temple, or buying a bulb, and so on, but you can never buy the All-pervading Power of God\'s Love. You cannot pay for that, as God doesn\'t understand money. This is simple, or Sahaj, and simple people will get it very easily. The more complicated you are, the more difficult it is to get this.\n\nToday, I have to take leave of you, and as a mother I am feeling very sad to leave you all. The seed has started germinating in you, and you are like small children. Take care of this, and yourself, and grow in Sahaja. Don\xe2\x80\x99t leave this. Try to grow in this. As long as the seed does not germinate, it is all right, but once it has started germinating, it should start implementing also. Otherwise it will go to waste.\n\nNow, like yesterday, this is the left side and that is the right side. I will address the left right only, so that most people can understand. Our left hand is the power of desire, which is Mahakali\'s power, our right hand is the power of action, which is Mahasaraswati\'s power, and the center path is that of Mahalaxmi. I could not talk about these deities as there was no time. Whenever I have time, I will explain all the information about Mahalaxmi, Sitaji, Radhaji and so on.\n\nNow, keep your left hand towards Me, and use your right hand. The left hand should be towards Me, all the time. If anyone wants to go, please go away now. It is not right to disturb anyone in the middle of meditation. It will take ten to fifteen minutes. You should not cause any fuss during meditation sessions. So, if you don\'t want this, please go away. This cannot be forced on you. You have to ask for it. You have to ask for it. Remember, I am not going to gain anything out of this.\n\nNow, with your left hand towards Me, put your right hand on your heart. Today, we have spoken about spirit. So here, we have to ask our spirit a question, three times, with our eyes closed. Then, on the left side of our upper abdomen, we have to ask the second question. Then, you have to take the right hand to the lower part of your abdomen. Then, you have to bring the same hand back to the upper abdomen and then to your heart. Then you have to bring your right hand to the neck and shoulder joint, on the left side. Many people keep from this side, from the other side, like you wear the sacred thread. Then, you have to put your hand across your forehead and press on the temples. Then take your hand behind your head, press it and push back your head. Then stretch your palm, putting it on your fontanelle bone; push your fingers backwards, and give pressure and rotate your scalp seven times, by giving pressure on your hand. This is all you have to do.\n\nNow close your eyes. Yesterday, people were using the wrong hand. This is your left hand. Keep your left hand towards Me throughout the session. Now, with the right hand, the action is done on the left side. If you understand this, then there is no problem. Now, close your eyes, and remove your spectacles also. Now, sit comfortably in sahajasan and keep your body straight. The neck should not lean to the front or to the back. Keep it straight. Now your left hand should be towards Me. Left hand all the time towards Me.\n\nNow put your right hand on your heart, and ask a question, \xe2\x80\x9cMother, am I a spirit? Mother, am I a spirit?\xe2\x80\x9d Ask this three times. This is a prime question.\n\nNow put your right hand on the left side of your upper abdomen and press. This is the place of the great Masters. Here you ask Me another question, three times: \xe2\x80\x9cMother, am I my own master?\xe2\x80\x9d If you are a spirit, then you are your own master.\n\nNow take your right hand to the lower part of your abdomen, on the left side. This is the place of pure knowledge, and I cannot force this knowledge on you. Knowing full well the Divine law and the true knowledge of the Divine, you have to ask here, \xe2\x80\x9cMother, please give me the pure knowledge.\xe2\x80\x9d Leaving behind your ego, ask very humbly, \xe2\x80\x9cMother, please give me the pure knowledge.\xe2\x80\x9d You have to say this six times as there are six petals in the Swadhisthana Chakra. Hmmm.\n\nNow, bring your right hand to the upper abdomen again, on the left side, which is your master\'s place. Now that the Kundalini has started awakening, you have to convince her. So, with full confidence say ten times: \xe2\x80\x9cMother, I am my own master.\xe2\x80\x9d Say this ten times. \xe2\x80\x9cMother, I am my own master.\xe2\x80\x9d You should have full confidence. Say this ten times with full confidence. If you have any problem on this element, it will clear away.\n\nNow, after saying this ten times, put your right hand again on your heart. With full confidence, here you have to say, \xe2\x80\x9cMother, I am a pure spirit.\xe2\x80\x9d Say this twelve times as there are twelve petals in the heart chakra. \xe2\x80\x9cMother, I am a pure spirit. I am not this body, this ego or this soul, but I am a pure spirit.\xe2\x80\x9d This is the absolute truth, and you have to achieve this. Haan! Say this twelve times.\n\nNow, take your right hand, on the neck and shoulder joint, from the front side; not like this, but like I told you, like this, and press hard. This is Vishnumaya\'s Vishuddhi Chakra. Here you have to say the mantra, \xe2\x80\x9cMother, I am not guilty. I am totally guilt-free.\xe2\x80\x9d You have to say this sixteen times. I told you before that God Almighty is an ocean of compassion, kindness, and love, but more than all these he is an ocean of forgiveness. So don\'t keep any guilt inside you, because he is so powerful that all your sins will be washed out by his forgiving quality. Just say, \xe2\x80\x9cMother, I am not guilty. I have not made any mistakes.\xe2\x80\x9d This chakra is catching very badly. People who still think that they are guilty, say 108 times, \xe2\x80\x9cI am not guilty.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nI told you in the beginning to be cheerful and not to underestimate yourself. You are going to the Kingdom of God. So don\'t demean yourself. Hmmm! Say with full confidence, \xe2\x80\x9cI am not guilty.\xe2\x80\x9d Hmmm. Say this sixteen times. Haaan!\n\nNow, put your right hand across your forehead and press on both sides. This Agnya Chakra is present both in the front and back. Here you have to say, \xe2\x80\x9cMother, I forgive everyone. I have forgiven everyone.\xe2\x80\x9d Don\xe2\x80\x99t argue with yourself that you cannot forgive. Actually, to forgive or not to forgive, both are myths, but if you don\'t forgive you are playing into wrong hands. So, from the bottom of your heart say, \xe2\x80\x9cMother, I forgive everyone.\xe2\x80\x9d Today one person was not able to feel the vibrations at all. I told him, \xe2\x80\x9cYou have not forgiven properly.\xe2\x80\x9d So when he said from his heart, \xe2\x80\x9cI forgive, I forgive, I forgive,\xe2\x80\x9d three times, his vibrations started flowing. Say from your heart, \xe2\x80\x9cMother, I forgive.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNow, take your right hand to the back of your head, and lift your head towards the sky. Here, without feeling guilty, without counting your sins, for your satisfaction, say from your heart, \xe2\x80\x9cGod, if I have made any mistakes against your dignity, please forgive me.\xe2\x80\x9d From the bottom of your heart. You will see that his power of forgiveness is tremendous. Hmmm!\n\nNow stretch your palm, and keep the centre of your right palm on the crown of your head, which was a soft bone in your childhood, and press hard. Rotate your scalp seven times, and you have to say, \xe2\x80\x9cMother, please give me my Self-realization.\xe2\x80\x9d I cannot force you, because you have the freedom. Press hard. Press with all your fingers. Stretch your fingers outwards, and rotate your scalp seven times, each time saying, \xe2\x80\x9cMother, give me Self-realization.\xe2\x80\x9d (Blowing air).\n\nNow slowly bring your hand down. Now open your eyes and look at Me, and observe that you are thoughtless. There are no thoughts coming. You are established in the state of Vilamb, which is called Nirvichar Samadhi. Now you have to establish Nirvikalpa, which may take some time.\n\nNow keep your left hand towards Me, and stretch your right hand also towards Me. Now, bend your head. Now take your left hand, four, five or six inches above your fontanelle bone, with your head bent. Bend your head, and see if any cool breeze is coming out of it. Bend your head and neck a little. Aaaan. Haaaan! Now lift your hand a little more above your head and check. For some people, the Kundalini rises very high. Shri Adi Shankaracharya has described this same Kundalini as "Saleelam, Saleelam, Saleelam". Haaan! Now bring the other hand towards Me. With your left hand towards Me, bend your head again and check with your right hand. Some people may get a hot breeze from their heads; no problem. Some people may not feel anything; no problem. But try to feel. Hmmm. Now again bring your right hand towards Me. Keep your left hand above your head and check with your head bent. Check with your attention on your crown area, and try to feel if anything cool is coming out.\n\nNow please lift both your hands towards the sky, look up by bending your head backwards, and say, \xe2\x80\x9cMother, is this the cosmic energy of Brahma? Is this God\'s Love? Is this the All-pervading Power of God\'s Love?\xe2\x80\x9d Ask this question three times.\n\nNow bring your hands down. Bring both your hands down, keep your hands like this in front of your heart, and check if you are feeling a slight cool breeze from your hands. Is it coming? On your head also you are feeling a little cool breeze. Check again. It\'s coming. The Kundalini has awakened in you. The fontanelle bone has been pierced, but only a hairline thickness of Kundalini\'s power has come out by piercing the fontanelle bone. You have to awaken all her powers, for which you will have to practice a little. Everyone can do this. You don\'t need to be educated for this. Everyone can know about this. It is very easy. It is Sahaja. You don\'t need to pay for this, but you have to spare some time for this. Much peace will settle inside you, and all your diseases will be cured, and many people can get rid of their addictions, too. Whenever you think of your addictions, please think of Me, and you will get rid of them.\n\nToday I am leaving you all and going away, but I will come back after a year, and I hope to see you all in the form of a huge tree which will make Me say, \xe2\x80\x9cThese are the saints who are realised souls.\xe2\x80\x9d May God bless you all.\n\nPlease sit down for a moment. Don\'t be in a hurry. I am still sitting here. Whoever felt the cool breeze from the head or in the hands, raise both your both hands. Either on the hand or from the crown. Wow! Wonderful. My salutations to all. Now you all have taken rebirth, and you have to respect this. Now, you are the knower of Brahma.\n\nSahaja yogi brother: Shri Mataji ki jai! Gentlemen, we the Jaipur people are very lucky that Shri Mataji came here and taught us everything. We are grateful to Her. On Jaipur public demand and their wishes, Mataji has arranged a center in Sarojini Marg, 49 c, where She is staying, on Saturday evening. On Sunday morning at 9 o\'clock in this same place, Shri Mataji\'s learned disciples will guide you through the program. We hope Shri Mataji will come here from time to time and guide us to establish whatever She has taught us and show us the path ahead. Jai Govind.\n\nShri Mataji: Please, all of you take the photo.\n\nSahaja yogi brother: I forgot to tell you something: Shri Mataji\'s photo is available in the\n\nfront. Please collect it, and whenever you are meditating, keep this in front of you and practice.\n\nShri Mataji: And whatever you want, ask My photo.\n\nSahaja yogi brother: Keep the photo in front of you and make use of it.\n'
