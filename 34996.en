Another Mozart, Lincoln, Gandhi?

Shri Mataji: Actually, in the West, I must say, it was unsolved, another unfortunate thing that you never had good kings. All horrible kings were there. And also, the people who came here, invaded Indians, and all those people were very cruel people. And that time aggressiveness was regarded as a very courageous thing. So, the aggression is still on. But we had people like Abraham Lincoln in this country. Think of it. And but for Abraham Lincoln you would not have been even knowing about freedom. But can we produce one Abraham Lincoln again? We can only have Reagan the actor.

Sahaja Yogis: Yes.

Shri Mataji: [Hindi] So this is what we have to understand. We had Mahatma Gandhi in India. Can we produce another Mahatma Gandhi? We had Shivaji in Maharashtra. Can we produce another Shivaji? As if they are all legendary people. We had Maxim Gorki. Can we produce another one like him in Russia? Or even Lenin? We have had in England people like Shakespeare. Can we have another one to replace him?

Art. We had Michelangelo. Can we have another one nearer him?

Music. We had Mozart. Can you replace him today? Anybody can beat him? In the West, I am talking. We had Garibaldi. Can we have another Garibaldi? We cannot. So, the quality has gone down definitely. And no hope. So, this is the only hope we have, that we’ll create out of Sahaja Yogis all these great people again. All right? [Hindi] Let us go to something pleasant.

Sahaja Yogini: Really hungry.

Shri Mataji: [Hindi]

Sahaja Yogini: She cooked so much [unclear].

Shri Mataji: [Hindi] Come here. There’s a red sari with a zaari border and that’s a present [pleasantly matched?] for cooking you must have it.
