Public Program

I bow to all, all of you who are seekers of truth. At the very outset we have to know that truth is what it is. You cannot organise truth, you cannot conceptualize it. Unfortunately you cannot know truth at human awareness. Whatever I'm going to tell you today, you need not accept it blindly but you must have an open mind like a scientist and if I am putting forward before you a hypothesis, if it works then you have to accept it as honest people.

The truth is extremely simple, that you are not only this body, this mind, this ego, these conditionings but you are the spirit, you are the divinity and the second one is that there is an All Pervading Power of divine love which is doing all living work. For example we take these beautiful flowers for granted, how a simple seed has created these beautiful flowers. We never even think about it, even we don't think how we have been evolved from amebae stage to human level. There are so many things we do not think about and there are so many things which cannot be explain to us even by science. I think only 25 % things can be explained whichever are very obvious but the science cannot tell us how, the periodic law has been constructed by which intelligent creator that has put all elements in such a beautiful manner which also indicates what new elements we are going to discover. In a human body any foreign material that goes, it has to be thrown out. That's the nature of the human body but when a child is conceived it's not thrown out, it's all there, it's staying, is looked after, it's kept, nourished and at the right time it comes out of the body of the mother. So it is to be understood that living processes we have not been able to explain nor did we ever think about it. I'm talking to you about the living process of our evolution. Human beings are at the epitome of evolution, no animal, no creature which they say exist here and there may be just a conjecture is higher than human beings.

Moreover is the only human beings who have got freedom. If they want they can go to hell but if they want they can go to heaven. Now at this time when we call it a Kali Yuga, these modern times are already described as one of the worse times of darkness and ignorance and people will be in lots of illusions, at these horrible times when we see all other shocking things happening in our lives, in our countries, in the whole world, then we start wondering who is responsible for all these problems. If you are little humble we'll find, it's we, the human beings. We have gone wrong, there has been something wrong within us that we have brought forth all these problems upon ourselves, they may be individual or they may be collective, they may be national could be international, so to solve these problems, supposing because of certain machinery, something goes wrong, then what do we do, is to attend to that machinery.

So what we need is a transformation. And the time has come for us to achieve the transformation which is described in all the scriptures, in the Bible it is described as the second birth, even in the Hindu scripture it's described as the Brahmagan or you can call it (?) second birth Vijaha, it is described in the Koran, it's described in all the Buddha's teachings, described by Mahavira, it's described by Nanaka, by all the religious people even Confucius has talked about it, Laotse has talked about it. Now what is that second birth is? Second birth is not just getting another certificate, we're these, we're that, we're that.

We believe we're Christians, we're Hindus, we're Muslims, we're these, we're that, everybody thinks no end of themselves. If you ask a Jew he'll say the Christians are the doomed ones, they'll go to hell directly, as if God has told them very clearly that Christians are going to be doomed forever (laughs), if you are the Christians they'll say the same about the Muslims or the Jews and the Muslims will say about the Hindus, and Hindus will say about the Muslims. But any one of them is capable of committing any sin. Nobody is bound by anything, the religion is not innately built within themselves as so many things are built within us in our evolution like.

If you want a dog to go through a dirty, filthy place, he can go but a human being cannot go because it's built in within him, in the evolutionary process that sensitivity to filth and dirt. But we have got the freedom, the freedom is given because ultimately you have to have a full freedom, so by using this little freedom you will be able to know what is right and what is wrong but it is not so, because we live in a relative world, some people say this is right some people say that is right. We're running from one place to another and find the stories the same for all of them. People are so much in tension, so much in trouble.

What is the reason for all these troubles is that, we are all sitting in the darkness. Supposing there is complete darkness, you cannot see anything and you want to grab something, you grab a snake and somebody says there's a snake in your hand, you won't give it up till it bites. But if there is little light we just give it up. So what we need is the light of the Spirit within you, it has to shine in your attention.

So he has already told you about these centers that are within you, these subtle centers that are within you and this Kundalini, which is your Mother. Everybody has an individual Mother and She's the one who gives you realization. It happens in a very short time, a great saint called Ramadasa who was the master of one great king Shivaji was asked how much time does it take for a Kundalini to rise, so he said Tat Shana, means that moment, but there should be a giver and there should be a receiver.

Today I find in this world there are so many people who are seeking truth, they're not satisfied with whatever minimum they know of spirituality, but they think that there is something beyond must be there, we must be find it out and the search is going on which I told you before also in other places, that William Blake* has clearly said, very clearly, he was a great saint, was regarded as mad man in his days and later on also but he said that "men of God will find God and they will make others Godly". That is the time today, this is the time of your last judgement, God is not going to put you onto any weighing scale.

This Kundalini is going to tell you where are you wrong, what are your problems, what are the centers which are in trouble and once she tells you that if you know how to correct it, you are forgiven and you're perfectly all right and you find that everything that is your being is working so well and ultimately you're surprised to see that you become a divine computer because when she passes through these centers, these centers are like left and right as we have seen the left and right to sympathetic nervous system and parasympathetic in the center.

So when you are using these right to much or left to much they move like these, but supposing something happens in the left and it breaks with a shock then these cells have no control (are?) never controlled by your brain because the connection is broken and it starts working on its own, the cells starts working on its own, that means they become arbitrary, they become malignant that's how you develop cancer all psychosomatic troubles come by them.

As a simple thing happens with Kundalini. She's just waiting for you to ask for your realization, that's all because She is the power of pure desire and the pure desire within you whether you know it or not is to get your self realization. So when She rises She passes through these centers, She goes into this one and then into this one pierces through both of them, brings them back to the normal, nourishes them, and then pierces through this fontanelle bone area which is the soft bone in your childhood. This is the actualization, actualization of baptism, is not just putting somebody the hand, like William Blake has said that "A priest cursed my fontanelle."

Actually you have to get it, so this is the last break through when we become super human being or we can call we become godly, we become divine, we touch our Divinity. Now people talk of God, they go to church, they go to temple, they go to mosque but they don't know how powerful God is, how miracle, miraculous He is - how He looks after us, how He guides us and how He can empower us. But when you get your Self Realization that is when this Kundalini crosses over, the first thing that happens to you that you become thoughtlessly aware, Nirvichara Samadhi. That is you are aware but there is no thought, now see there's a nice carpet before Me. I'm watching it, just watching it, but normally I would say, "All right, how much is this, must have cost? I must buy one like that", or I might start thinking I mean I'll always react, "All right, this carpet if it is mine and it's greater headache, I'm not yet insured it, God knows in these public place what will happen to my carpet." All kinds of worries can enter into my head if I posses it, but supposing I have a capacity just to watch it and not to react, then what will happen? All the joy that the man who created this as putting to it starts as an abstract peaceful flow of joy.

Just enjoy, not to think, not react, just to enjoy because one reaches the essence of that creation which is joy. It's like a lake which is absolutely calm, ripple less; and all the surroundings the beautiful creation completely reflected in that beautiful still lake is what happens to a person who becomes thoughtlessly aware and then he grows in that state. It's a state, it is no certificate. It's a state where you start growing in that state spiritually till you reach the ocean of your divinity which is within you already. Then you are completely relaxed, you are just watching, watching the whole drama, you are the witness, like we are seeing some play or some picture of film, we start getting excited, oh God what's going to happen to this, then suddenly the film is over, oh it was a film, it was just a drama, in the same way we feel, it's just a drama, you do not get involved into it.

Another way I can explain to you, that those people who are in the water are afraid of the waves, but supposing you get into the boat another state, then you can see those waves, you can enjoy them but supposing you become a swimmer then you can jump into that, you can jump into the water and you can save others.

This is what into three stages you move in Sahaja Yoga. First you become thoughtlessly aware. Then the second stage what we call is doubtlessly aware, when you have no doubts about yourself, you know you have the power, you know you can work it out, you know everything about it, everyone knows the same thing, you know the absolute truth, then you know this is truth and everybody knows the same truth, you put ten children cover their eyes and put the gentlemen before, ask what is wrong with this person, they'll all say here, you ask the gentlemen, "Have you got problem with your throat?"

"Yes! How do you know?"

Because they'll feel the same finger, all of them, burning and this finger is then decoded as the center of Vishuddhi. All children will feel the same, so there is no question of argument, there is no question of discussion. Just enjoy each other because you know each other as you know your own body. You become part and parcel of the whole, so the second state when we become collectively conscious, absolutely collectively conscious, you know your own centers that is.

The first state when we call Atma boddha means to know your self on your central nervous system; and the second state is when you become doubtlessly aware, where you are collectively conscious, absolutely conscious, you know what's wrong with another person. And then you become a Sahaja Yogi where you know how to correct these centers within you and without. These are the only three stages which are very simple> People have achieved some of them over night, some of taken eight days, and some have taken a month. Of course there are some who have taken even two years I must say but there is the problem is with these people that they still go on doubting themself and they think that "How can we get to this, how can I be divine? I'm such a nice person that I should lead a very happy life, instead of that why should I do these things?" or he thinks "I'm a very bad person, how can I get this?" It is inevitable, everybody has to get it, otherwise you can't exist in this world, is an impossibility. Like first of one fish came out of the water falling out, then few more came, then few more but later on shawls of fishes came out, of course there are still so many fishes at that stage.

So these people who are seeking the truth are the only one who are going to receive, it cannot be forced on anyone because human freedom has to be respected, is given us with a special reason. Like when you go to school they tell you two plus two is four but when you grow up go to college they tell you are on your own, now find out yourself because later on you have to be completely on your own. In the same way at this stage you are given this freedom to choose in the glory of your freedom what right, what wrong, you think it to be. So try in your (method?) you may know what is right and what is wrong and once you get it then it's so blissful, it's so miraculous. It's so beautiful that you enter into Kingdom of God. It may sound very fantastic in these modern times when we cannot even think of God, we cannot even talk of God, but He exists, He's there, His power is there. We need not get upset with anything, we need be. frustrated, he has created us to be human beings to enter into His Kingdom not to in anyway left behind, struggling, but to give you all that this is his wealth, his joy his blessings.

Today, being the first day, I'll be happy if you can ask Me some questions, but I would request you one thing. I'm not here to take any money from you nor am I interested in politics that I want to have any goods from you. It is for your emancipation there is a built in system within you which works just like a sprouting of the seed. There's no obligation of mind or any thing, it's just one enlightened candle can enlighten another candle, you get your self realization. So please don't ask Me any question which is irrelevant, "what do you think of this person, what do you think of that person, what do you think of yourself?" There is no need to ask because whatever I tell you why you must believe Me? It's a blind faith, you must find it out, you have to find it out yourself, you have to certify yourself. You have to see for yourself that you have got this great blessing of being self realised by which you emancipate not only that but you are capable of emancipating, thousands and thus, this is the system by which there is the emancipation of the whole world will come forth. I hope you will ask Me some questions, and then we'll have this process of Self Realization which will hardly take ten to fifteen minutes. Today and tomorrow I'll be able to tell you what is the Spirit and what the manifestation means to us. Thank you very much.

Put your left hand towards Me on your lap which is suggested comfortably, you have to sit comfortably, so don't have to go to Himalayas standing on heads or only one leg nothing of the kind, its just (be?) very comfortably (laughing) You shouldn't of course slouch back or you should not also sort of bend that's not to thing but sit comfortably with the left hand. All right now put the left hand towards Me like this, simple as that, we suggest that you are (desirous?) of having your Self Realization. You have to put both of feet apart from each other because there are two powers - one is the power of desire, left side; and the power of action on the right side. So now the left hand you put it towards Myself, we suggest that symbolically that you want to have your self realization. Use the right hand to nourish our centers to show our self-confidence.

So now first we put our hand, on the right hand, I'll show you now and later we'll close our eyes. This is the center as I told you is where the Spirit resides, now if you are the Spirit then in the light of the spirit you become your own master, so now take your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side, we're working on your left hand-side, now this is the center on the left hand-side which is your mastery. When you become the Spirit gradually you become the master of yourself and the master of all this knowledge. This is created by great prophets and great masters, real masters for us. Then we take down our hand in the lower portion of our abdomen left hand-side, this is the center of pure- knowledge, surprisingly that the center of pure knowledge is here, once you get the pure knowledge you will know what are the laws which are divine also you'll know how to use them and how act according to them.

Now raise your hand again in the upper portion of your abdomen, and then again on your heart, now in the corner of your neck and your shoulder here, and turn your head to your right at this point again I have to say that you are not to feel guilty, this center is catching quite a lot, so please don't feel guilty, you're not going to miss your realization by that, now you have to take your right hand on top of your forehead with your fingers on one side and your thumb on the other, press it hard and put it down as far as possible. This is the center for forgiving everyone in general, now, we take back our right hand on the back side of our head and push back our head as far as possible, this is the center where without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, for your satisfaction you have to ask forgiveness from this all pervading power of God's love.

Now, here is your hand again you stretch your palm fully, put the center of your palm on top of the fontanelle bone area which was a soft bone in your childhood. This is the for the actualization of your baptism through which the Kundalini will come out (in pure truth?) so is very important center. Now remember to push back your fingers as far as possible, now put down your head, push back your fingers and move your scalp, slowly seven times clockwise, please push back your fingers that's very important, so that we put a good pressure on your scalp and move it seven times clockwise slowly.

[long pause] That's all we have to do, that's all.

Now we have to close our eyes. You can take out your spectacles because you shouldn't open your eyes till I tell you, also if you have something very tight on your waist very tight or on your neck then you can little bit reduce the pressure on these two centers. Whatever I have told you all these conditions in short means you should be very pleasantly placed towards yourself because you are going to enter into the Kingdom of God, so you have to be very pleasantly placed towards yourself.

Now please put left hand towards Me, both the feet apart from each other and put right hand on your heart, and now close your eyes. Here you have to ask a very fundamental question about you to Me. You can call Me "Mother" or you can call Me "Shri Mataji", whatever you like. Please ask the question three times in your heart, all these questions are to be asked in your heart. "Mother am I the Spirit?" Ask this question, three times, "Mother am I the Spirit?" as I told you if you are the Spirit you get the guide to yourself so you become a master of yourself, the Spirit becomes your master.

So now take your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side, here ask another fundamental question three times, "Mother am I my own master? Mother am I my own master?" Ask this question three times, please. I've already told you that I respect your freedom and the pure knowledge cannot be forced on you.

So now please take your hand in the lower of your abdomen. This center has got six pedals, so please ask six times, "Mother please give me pure knowledge." "Mother please give me pure knowledge" six times. When you ask for pure knowledge Kundalini starts moving upward, so we have to nourish our upper centers with our self-confidence, so please raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side and press it and here again you have to say with full confidence ten times, "Mother I am my own master." Please say it with full confidence ten times, "Mother I am my own master."

I've already told you the fundamental truth about you is that you are not this body not mind, you are not this conditionings and the ego, nor these emotions and intelligence but you are the pure Spirit. So now raise your right hand on top of your heart, and here with full confidence please say twelve times, "Mother I am the pure spirit." Please say that, "Mother I am the pure Spirit." Please say twelve times.

Now, one has to understand that this All Pervading Power is the ocean of knowledge, is the ocean of compassion, love and bliss, is the ocean of truth; but above all it is the ocean of forgiveness and whatever wrong you might have done, this ocean of forgiveness can completely forgive you. It is that powerful. So forgive yourself and raise your right hand into the corner of your neck and your shoulder and turn your head to your right. Here you have to again, say it with full confidence 16 times, full confidence, "Mother I am not guilty at all. Mother I am not guilty at all." Please say it 16 times with full confidence.

I've already told you whether you forgive or don't forgive you don't do anything but if you don't forgive then you play into wrong hands, so you have to forgive, if you don't forgive as it is all your lives you're playing into wrong hands and if you don't forgive you will also miss out your realization because this center won't open, so please forgive.

Now raise your right hand on top of your forehead across put the fingers on one side and your thumb on the other, press it hard on the temples and now put it down your head as far as possible, here again you have to say with full confidence from your heart not how many times but from your heart, "Mother I forgive everyone in general", "Mother I forgive everyone in general." This is very important, without your forgiving I cannot forgive, you have to forgive yourself.

Now, please take your right hand now the backside of your head and push back your head as far as possible. Now here you have to say again with full confidence and from your heart not how many times, without counting your mistakes, without feeling guilty just for your satisfaction you have to say, "Oh All Pervading Power, please forgive me if I have done anything wrong knowingly or unknowingly." "Oh All Pervading Power, if I have done anything wrong knowingly or not knowingly please forgive me", say it with full confidence.

Now the last center which is very important, please stretch your palm fully, put the center of your palm on top of your head on the fontanelle bone area which was a soft bone in your childhood. Now put down your head as far as possible and push back your fingers, please this is very important that please push back your fingers, here again I cannot force self realization on you because I respect your freedom, I cannot cross over it, so move your hand now seven times slowly clockwise say seven times "Mother please give me Self Realization."

[Shri Mataji now blows into the microphone 7 times]

Now please take down your hands, please take down your hands. Open your eyes, you can wear your glasses. Now put your hands towards Me please like this, just put them. Watch Me without thinking, let us see please watch Me without thinking. Now please put the right hand forward like this and bend your head and see for yourself if there is a cool or a warm or a hot breeze like waves are coming from your fontanelle bone area, but don't put the hand on top of your head but away from it and see for yourself. Sometimes you can get it very far sometimes quite close, so just try to feel if there's cool or hot or warm breeze like waves are coming it is you have to certify yourself.

Now put the left hand towards Me. Now again put down your head and see for yourself again is there's a cool breeze or a warm or a hot breeze is coming. It is warm or hot because you have not forgiven perhaps or may be you have a liver problem or some other problem but it doesn't matter at least you must forgive. Please forgive to help Me and help yourself, please forgive.

Again, you put your right hand toward Me and put down your left hand on top of your head and see for yourself if there is a cool breeze or a hot or a warm breeze coming out of your head. Bend your head, bend, if you don't bend it won't be so much clear, just bend, all right.

Now, raise your both hands towards the sky like this and turn your head towards the sky upward. Here you have to ask Me a question, anyone of these three questions, you can ask any question three times, "Mother is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?" or "Mother is this the All Pervading power of Gods love?" or "Mother is this the Paramchaitanya?" Ask any one of these questions three times, put your hands up and your head upward and just ask this question in your heart.

Now please take down your hands. Put your hands like this. All those who have felt cool, warm or hot breeze slightly out of their fontanelle or on their fingertips, please raise both your hands.

Look at this (full?), May God bless you, what seekers, what great people, may God bless you, you (center hood?) has started, it's like the sprouting of the seed now. Christ has said a parable and this is the parable: "Again I tell you, the seeds which have sprouted have to grow into trees." It takes no time whatsoever but you have to come to the collective. You enjoy this peace, enjoy this joy within yourself but you have to come to the collective, this is the only way you will be cleansed. In Sahaja Yoga it is very simple, you have to give sometime in a week to come to the collective and they will tell you how to meditate five minutes in the morning and ten minutes in the evening, minimum that much is needed, but if you like it you can do it more. It's a very simple method, has to be simple because it is very fatal you are now joining a big revolution in the whole world, which has to bring forth the spirituality into the whole humanity transforming. May God bless you all. Thank you very much.
