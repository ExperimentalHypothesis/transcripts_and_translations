From 30:27sec Shri Mataji speaks

Shri Mataji:

I bow to all the seekers of truth. As I said yesterday the seekers of truth are a special category of people in the evolutionary process of human beings. Those who are seeking reality see clearly that whatever we have known so far is not the reality, but whatever is unknown is not reality also. Human beings have been made especially with great care, delicately to ascent to the highest state of the spirit and there are many things which are kept away absolutely from their awareness just to keep them peaceful.

For example, we do not know about our subconscious and about collective subconscious, also we do not know about Supra conscious area and the collective Supra conscious. They are manifested within us by two powers, as you see - one the power of Desire on the left hand side and one by the power of action on the right hand side.

The left hand side, which caters to our subconscious, manifests the emotions within us and all the conditioning that people talk about and beyond the subconscious lies the collective subconscious. On the right hand side of ours is manifested our futures, which is the Supra conscious mind and the right side channel what we call as the channel for action manifest the Supra conscious, beyond that lies the collective supra conscious, but the super consciousness is on the top of our head where we have to ascent, we are not to go to the collective subconscious or to the subconscious or to the Supra conscious and the collective Supra conscious.

If somebody tries to use the emotion and the conditioning too much then he goes into the collective subconscious by which he can get possessed and he talks like a possessed person, also the alcoholism can take you to the collective subconscious. Those people who go too much to the left side to the emotional side get possessed and get troubles which are mental in nature.

Now in America there is a new disease that has come where people get mad before their 35 years of age, this trouble is coming not from any other thing but a simple thing that they indulge too much in to the subconscious and into the collective subconscious.

There are some drugs, most of the drugs also take you to the left side to the collective subconscious, but some of them like LSD and all that take you to the right side to the Supra conscious side, so the left side the subconscious is our past takes us to our past. When people start taking too much drugs, alcohol or take to fake gurus then they are thrown into the subconscious mind and then towards the collective subconscious.

The false Gurus mesmerize you by putting some sort of a protein within you which we call as the dead spirit and collect from you your money whatever they want, you do exactly what they tell you. Such adventures are very unwise that is why before going to any Guru you must find out the deceit person, if they are free people or brainy washed. Most of the fake Gurus have gone to America and that is the reason also that people are getting insane and those who are even in Switzerland the Americans travel all the way to pay thousands of pounds, thousands of franks to these Gurus and get a boon of madness.

The people who go into trance or people who say they are mediums you should keep away from them. In India we know all about and we call it as Preta Vidya,  Smashan Vidya meaning the knowledge of the symmetry, of the death, signs of the death. Now there are also other type of organizations which have started which make you all the time pray, pray, pray like mad. you go to the collective subconscious.

I have seen people coming from holy crucial or from charismatic moment absolutely mad people. Those who come from Hare Rama Hare Krishna also are like mad people or about to become mad, the reason is when you start taking the name of Rama or Christ or anyone you are not connected to them, but when you try too hard your attention has to move somewhere and it catches somebody who is dead with the name Rama. Now if unless and until you are connected with those deities if you take their names you get joined to people who are already dead.

And this is a very common phenomenon in India where the people are absolutely in the villages who are uneducated and are virginals they do all these things and they end up as a bad people at a very early age and it happens so smoothly that people don't even realize that they are becoming mesmerized.

If you remember yesterday there was one lady she started jumping before me she was possessed because she had been to a very horrible Guru. Parapsychology also is the same style of thing which are luckily so many people are practicing and you can see the result of that even in Russia you can see how people are suffering from insane. I am your mother and I have to tell you the truth to protect you, I am not afraid of anyone.

Now on the right hand side when you move, say like LSD or other things if you are a very ambitious man, a futuristic person such a person gets too ambitious, I tell there are people who are ambitious, who are dead, try to possess such people. Like you had one organisation called as late Dr. Lans International Hospital, this late doctor died long time back but his soul possessed a soldier in Vietnam, they themselves tell about this. Then this Dr told this man the Vietnamese fellow who was shocked by some sought of a bomb that you better go to London and tell my son about me and there are many doctors who would like to help my son so you start this curative centre or hospital and they started this Hospital. As a result of that many people wrote to them that we want to get cure and they would answer by saying at this time something will enter into your body and you will be cured and when that happened the people used to shake and with that shaking after sometime they would feel better for some time, but after three four years they would develop a terrible disease of the Nervous system and all the time they were on the bed and died there because I have cheated these patients.

Even Hitler used these ambitious spirits, he got this knowledge from the Lama- the Dalai Lama in those days and he taught it how to capture the spirits of the people who were very ambitious and cruel and then he mesmerize the German people and that is how the German people killed human beings in that horrible way.

Even now you can find some of them possessed like that, but not only that it happens but you also get physical manifestation of this kind of movement. Most of the diseases which are incurable come from the left side movement like cancer, sclerosis, mellitus all kinds of such diseases which are not curable come from the left side that is also like AIDS, the madness, the epilepsy all that comes when you try too much to go to the left side.

On the right side when you move too much you get troubles like heart attack and troubles like what you call the paralysis, high blood pressure, kidney trouble all this troubles come to you because you are very right sided. Now the right-sided person is the person who is all the time thinking about the future, for example I will tell you about one disease like you can say the blood cancer. In Modern Times people are all the time under pressure for no fault of theirs, early in the morning they get up, read newspaper and the newspaper always gives bad news so they get shocked, then is in the hurry to go to the office or something, is in great hurry he doesn't even take his food properly, he has to run up and the spleen that has to give blood for this various emergencies gets bad.

For example, the Swadishthana Chakra is the one which has to look after your spleen, it has to look after your liver, it has to look after your kidney, it has to look after your pancreas, it has to look after your spleen, but when it is doing all this jobs there is very important job he has to do one more that is to convert the fat of the stomach for the use of the brain and when that is going to happen that is going to take place and if all the time that’s what is happening that we are all the time thinking and that he has to transform all the time the cell then it has no time to look after the other organs. As the result of that you get the liver trouble, you get the diabetes from the pancreas you and get high blood pressure from the kidneys.

Now the spleen again is neglected of such a person so when the spleen gets shocks aftershocks of new emergencies coming it becomes hectic it becomes crazy. Now when it becomes crazy at that time such a person if it moves the attention to the left hand side then he is attacked for the doctors calls protein 58 or protein 53. The doctor says that these proteins come to us from the area which is being within us since our creation means collective subconscious, thus what happens that a person gets into blood cancer.

Now when Kundalini rises she supplies all the vital means that is needed for this pacemaker which is actually the spleen within us which gives proper speed with balanced speed. Thus when Kundalini rises you get all the centres enlightened and you feel perfectly alright you become absolutely healthy, you at least look 10 years younger, all your wrinkles vanish and you look very very bright and mentally also you become extremely alert and sensitive. Above all when the Kundalini pierces through your fontal bone then you yourself become the source of joy, you yourself become the source of health for others and you yourself create peace and balance among people and when this is a achieved and established  fully  even your glance can do the job. Then when you are enlightened you do not ask you just give. Thus when you are a realized soul you are never involved you become like a king, you may lie in the richest place or may lie in the poorest place, it makes no difference to yourself, you become very comfortable with whatever way you live because now you seek the comfort of your spirit and the comfort of the spirit is that it should be able to give compassion to others, that it should be able to create peace among human beings, but so many miracles take place that you are away that the working of this all pervading power.

I can tell you some of the miracles for your interest. I have been to a place called Medford  in London and there one boy fell down from a bridge about 20 feet down, at that time I was addressing at least 600 people in a hall and that place was at least ten miles away from where I was speaking. He had never seen me before but when the ambulance came he walked up all the way and they were amazed because he fell on stones and nothing had happened to him and he told the police that a lady in white came, she came in a white car, she came down and she cured me and the people who were on the bridge said no there was no Indian lady who came, there was no white car came in but he was not at all hurt and there was not even a scratch so doctors were surprised. So next day he saw my photograph in the newspaper and he told the news paper people and the doctors and the police that this is the lady who came. So they came to us and started enquiring they published it also in the newspaper. So the Sahajayogi asked the boy what did you do when you fell down, he said while falling I said Holy Mother please help me but it helps you materially.

Now even the judge will be surprised that there is so much of unemployment but will be amazed to know that not one Sahajayogi, we have thousands is unemployed they get jobs without trouble they get their ashrams without trouble they get everything whatever they want. If you see them you will feel that they are such great scholars but some of them are not even educated in the school.

I met one gentleman who drove me down in his bullock cart in the village and I just talked to him. And I was surprised, he was talking like a great saint like Kabira and I asked him, "How you know all this?" he says, "The knowledge is within my head now". That is what happens that you become the knowledge. None of these great saints, prophets, incarnations went to any universities and they are full of knowledge. In the same way, you all can get it because this is a special time when many have to get Realization. This is the Last Judgment, your Kundalini is going to judge you. It is not that you are going to be put in the way, in machine, or anything, but it is the Kundalini when she will rise, you yourself will judge yourself. And full chance will be given to you, absolute full chance to save yourself, to have your redemption fully. Complete counseling will be done.

First will become certain then you will be deep and complete counseling about this knowledge you will get. This is the time very important, you should not miss it anymore, try to understand in this country and in other countries there has been some idea traditionally about salvation.

But India, people know in the villages in the places which are not affected by western life that the salvation time has come is already predicted. Thousands of years back there was a great (1:08:20) pinion of astrology called as Bhrigumuni, who has written a book called Nadi Granth. He has described very clearly how Sahajayoga is going to work out. Even recently we have had a great poet in England called as William Blake who has clearly described in modern times, he has said that men of God that is the seekers, men of God will become the prophets and they will have power to make other prophets.

In India a great Saint called Gyaneshwara has described that there will be forest of human beings who will be granting the wish of other people. Kalpataru means the forest of trees granting of wishes and there will be the oceans of the Ambrose flowing from these people to save others. So much has been described in various books now the time is there.

May God bless you all.

Please get your realization and establish it. As I told you, you must have a open mind like the scientist has. This knowledge to you is like the hypothesis, but if it is proved you have to accept as honestly because it is for individual good, for the good of the community, for the good of the country, for the good of the world.

May god bless you all.

Questions now? No no no wait somebody has written the questions. We would not like to disturb the people who have come here for realization because sometime questioning can disturb them; they are in a mood of receiving realization. So yesterday's questions were not something very important, by questioning and answering you are not going to get your realization.

The main thing is you get your realization, no one can guaranty it as it is a living process, so it has to work out and that you should get that realization is the main point. To get the realization I would say if some people want to come on the stage can come also, if there are people sitting on the ground are in difficulties can come on the stage if they want. Or those want to go away can go away but don’t disturb others.

[Mother speaks aside: Come along. Those who are sitting down. Please, be seated. Please. Cold is it? There is nothing to spread for them. Is it very cold there? Must be. Sit, sit, sit. I’m sorry, it is cold? Is it cold there? Is it cold? no, no. it`s alright. All right.]

Take out your shoes all of you. All of you should sit down quietly or if the people in front can come all of them can sit in front it is better, as many can come on the stage. Now don't fight please don't disturb. Please keep quiet. It is a very important time don't disturb others we have to be very very kind to others.

I will stand up you will all be able to see me. Alright

[Mother speaks aside: It’s all right. better sit now. I’ll tell you later on. (Something like: next time I will talk Italian?)]

I wish we had a bigger stage. All right. Now, it’s very simple. You have to take out your shoes because this Mother Earth has the power to suck in our problems. So please take out your shoes and put both the feet parallel to each other. You can take out also your spectacles; it helps your eye sight. If there is anything very tight on your stomach or in the neck, you can loosen it a little bit. All the people should be seated. All the people should be seated properly and should not move about at all.

Now with both the hands like this, you have to know that these hands and the fingers here are denoting the seven centers on the left hand side and the seven centers on the right hand side.

[Mother said several words to someone aside, not clear].

Now, there are seven centers five, six and seven, these are five, six and seven which we learn very soon. This left hand is responsible for our desire; to get Realization is our main desire today. With this desire you put your left hand forward like this, comfortably. You should not be uncomfortable. Sit in the way that you feel comfortable. You may sit twisting both the legs on one side will be alright. [to someone: No, the other way.] Both the legs on one side you can put it. It’s alright. It’s alright. Put the left hand like this. Left like this. Left hand. Left like this. Comfortably, comfortably.

Now Right hand we have to use for action. Now we have to use that, on the left hand side. And to use that on the left hand side we have to put this on different centers, because you are going to raise your own Kundalini. At that point I’m going to just tell you where to put your hand and later on when you close your eyes you will know, just now I will just show you. The right hand should go first in the heart then in the upper portion of the stomach then in the lower portion of the stomach. Now, one must know it is all on the left hand side. Again should go back to the upper part of the stomach then to your heart and then to the corner between your shoulder and your neck. From the front many people put it like this is not good, this way it’s comfortable.

1:22:43

In the West this is the worst center, always caught up. It is caught up because one feels guilt. Now you are not to feel guilty at all, I’ll beg of you, you have done nothing wrong whatsoever. The Divine is the Ocean of Forgiveness and we cannot do anything that could be such that can challenge the power of the Divine. So nobody should count their wrongs and mistakes. If you feel not comfortable you can sit on the chair will be better. Not to make uncomfortable. [Mother speaks to someone: “Are you alright?”]

Now, it is [INAUDIBLE] that’s your own and you have right to get it, so what is there to feel guilty about? There is no need at all to feel guilty. [speaks to someone: “You can come here, there is a space or here you can come here.”]
All right. Now...

[Something happened and the public laughs gently. mother says to someone from the public: “All right. All right doesn’t matter. All right, as long as the feet are not towards me is alright. You can put them this way. All right.”]

So now what we do is to put the right hand after this here on the forehead then on the back then we have to stretch our hand and put it on top of the fontanel bone area, here on top of our head and press hard and move it seven times [INAUDIBLE] the scalp. Seven times that’s all.

Now nobody should watch others, one should watch oneself. Now, please close your eyes and don’t open your eyes till I’ll tell you because attention has to go inside. Now the left hand towards Me and the right hand on the heart, put it under the coat will be better. Towards Me means the palm should be towards the sky. Now, this left hand should be kept as it is up. After closing the eyes you ask Me a very fundamental question: “Mother, am I the Spirit?” Ask that question three times. Ask sincerely. Three times.

Now bring down your hand on the upper part of the stomach on the left hand side and press. Please take out your glasses. [INAUDIBLE] Now, the second question, very fundamental follows by the first. This is the center of the Masters created by all the great Masters. Here you ask Me another question, three times please ask Me: “Mother, am I my own master? Mother am I my own guide? Mother am I my own guru?”.

Now, please put your right hand in the lower part of the stomach, right hand, left hand towards Me, left hand towards Me (ASIDE TO SOMEONE FROM PUBLIC: [INAUDIBLE] You have to put your right. No. Right.) in the lower part of the stomach. This is the center which gives us the knowledge of the Divine. Please close your eyes otherwise it cannot work. Here you have to understand that I cannot force you to know this knowledge so you have to say: “Mother may I have this true knowledge? May I have the pure knowledge?” Please say six times because this center has got six petals. “Please, give me the true knowledge; please, give me the Divine knowledge, the pure knowledge”.

Now, raise your right hand in the upper part of your abdomen now and press. You shouldn’t talk, please don’t talk.

[Mother talks aside]: What’s happening?

Sahaja Yogi: She is feeling bad, Shri Mataji.

Mother: He?

Sahaja Yogi: She is feeling bad.

Mother:He?
Sahaja Yogi: She is feeling bad.

Mother: Bad?

Sahaja Yogi: Bad. She is in pain.

Mother: [INAUDIBLE] All right. Once again [INAUDIBLE]

Put your right hand on the upper part of the stomach, now at this point, as it is the center of the principle of mastery, you have to say: “Mother, I am my own Master” with full assertion and confidence for the Kundalini to come. Ten times you have to say: “Mother, I am my own Master”.  Please, stretch your left hand properly towards Me. Now, say it ten times, please.

Now raise your hand, right hand to your heart again, here you say with full faith in yourself: “Mother, I am the Spirit” say twelve times with full faith in yourself.

Now, put your right hand in the corner of your neck and the shoulder, this is the center what we call as the Left Vishuddhi, from the front right hand. As I’ve told you that the Divine is not only the Ocean of Love and Compassion but it is the Ocean of Forgiveness so please do not feel guilty and say sixteen times with all your heart and faith: “Mother, I am not guilty at all.” “I’m not guilty at all”, Sixteen times. This is the worst center and if you still feel like that you can say 108 times, to punish yourself. You should be pleasantly pray towards yourself, you are entering into the Kingdom of God and why should you feel guilty?

Now, raise your right hand on your forehead. Now, again with full compassion for everyone please say: “Mother, I forgive everyone” how many times is not the point, forgive or not. Please say: “Mother, I forgive everyone.” To say that I forgive is a mythical thing because whether you forgive or not it’s a myth but if you don’t forgive then you play into the hands of wrong people.

Now, for your own satisfaction you can put your hand on the back and say that: “Mother, if I have done any mistake, please, forgive me” and don’t count your mistakes, don’t feel guilty.

Now, raise your hand, stretch it. Put it on top of your head and press it hard and move it seven times, saying: “Mother I don’t have Realization, Please, give me.” I cannot force you to do that.

[Mother blows into the microphone seven times.]

Now please take down your hand, slowly open the eyes, watch Me without thinking. Now, put your right hand towards Me and left hand you put on top of your head and see if there’s the cool breeze coming out. Here, put it higher, move it. All right Just see. It’s coming out. Just see it, moving up and down. All right

Now, put the right hand on top of your head and left hand towards Me and see now if there’s a cool breeze coming. All right? Ha! You should just say: “Mother, I’m the Spirit now” just say in your heart.

Now raise your right hand, feel the experience. There is no air condition or anything, just see. Don’t doubt. Don’t doubt yourself and don’t doubt the [INAUDIBLE]. Now push back your head and push your hands up like this and ask the question three times: “Mother is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost? Is this the all-pervading power of God? Is this the Bramha Shakti?”All right now bring it down. See for yourself if you feel the cool breeze in the hand or the head. You got it?

Today I’ll teach you how to protect yourself when you go home. Most of you have felt it. Those who have felt it please raise your hand either on the head or in the hand. Raise your both the hands those who have felt it. Everybody practically has that.
May God bless you.

Now, some of you have not felt, very few. Everybody is [INAUDIBLE]. Not to feel bad about it and you are absolutely relaxed there is no thought; You can watch Me without thinking. Now I’m going to tell you how to protect yourself. Don’t wear your shoes just now, one minute. Every morning you must protect yourself.

You have to put your left hand towards Me like this now and you have to move the hand on your auras which has got the vibrations like this. Now we do it seven times, let’s do it, One, Two, Three, Four, Five, Six, Seven. Now you all can raise your Kundalini those who have not felt also can feel it. You please put the hand in front of your Kundalini where you are sitting, left hand and you have to watch the left hand going up like that and the right hand has to move upward, forward, backward, like that, clockwise, clockwise, upward, forward, downward, backward.

Ha! Now let’s start, you have to do it three times only. Watch your left hand, push back you head and give it a twist and tide up, [Speaks aside: Sorry. (Mother pushed the microphone)] Again. Watch the left hand, push back your head, give it a twist and tie up in your head. Once again, please. Now this time three knots: One, Two, Three. Now see. How much is flowing now, much more. Your eyes are all sparkling.
May God bless you.

I’m going away tomorrow to Venice and next year I definitely come but we have an ashram here, very good Sahaja Yogi. Please go and learn how to master it. Also we have a follow-on program, please go its in the city. Please attend it. All of you don’t waste it. Respect your Realization and those who haven’t got it will also get it, they must, maybe something is wrong physically, mentally, emotionally. So please get it checked up and enjoy yourself.

Thank you very much.

Oh! All of you have felt. Yes! You can see the eyes! See your eyes are sparkling.
