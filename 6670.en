Public Program Day 1. Sofia (Bulgaria), 24 July 1990.

I bow to all the seekers of truth. We have to know that truth is what it is. We cannot organize it, we cannot conceptualize it and we cannot know it with our human awareness. All this growth outside of our civilization is like a big tree but we have to know our roots how to be found out and they are within the human being. Whatever you have been told about the roots within ourselves, has to be understood with an open mind and if it works then you have to accept it as the truth, as honest people.

Now the truth is that there is the All Pervading Power of Love, which is a certain pure power, which we have never felt before. But the time has come now, that we can feel that All Pervading Power. Second truth is that you are not this body, you are not this mind, you are not your conditionings but you are pure Spirit. When you become the Spirit you can experience the All Pervading Power of Love, as cool breeze on your fingertips. These are special times when there are so many seekers of truth. I call it as a "blossom time", where many flowers have to become the fruits. Unless and until we know the absolute truth, there will be many opinions and many ideologies and everyone thinking that they are the best and the correct. That's why there are quarrels, fights and wars.

But when we feel absolute truth then there is no question of this [HACKERING] with another person. Moreover this power, which is doing all the living work, is the power of love, of pure love. It thinks, it organizes, it nourishes, it balances all living things. We do not even think when we do get our flowers, how beautiful they are, and they are coming out of a little seed. How it happens? How it happens? It's a living force. And the living force works it out. We have become human beings from the amoeba state and how did we become? We became spontaneously. Sahaja. Saha means with and Ja means born, and yoga means the union with that All Pervading Power. So, Sahaja Yoga means that all of you have a birthright to achieve this yoga and this is a fact.

And I've come to Bulgaria because I know now you are free people but without Self Realization you cannot understand how to be free. I've been to all the free countries, so called. Though politically they are free, but they are completely lost, they are getting destroyed from within, because they have no wisdom how far to go, they have no balance and this is not freedom but complete abandonment. Perhaps you people do not know what is the condition of these countries. I lived in London, where every week 2 children are killed in that city, by their parents and all the time there is violence of the worst type. You cannot go out wearing even a small chain in New York. So, though outwardly they look prosperous, but they have become so superficial now, that the chances of their Realizations it wouldn't be very big. So, unless and until we have Self Realization, we also do not know how to use money.

They have developed so many diseases, which are incurable, out of their so-called freedom. So we have to have the light of the Self in our attention, to see and know what is wrong with us and how do we relate to others. This light gives us wisdom and that is a very important thing that should happen to us. Today I wanted you to ask Me some questions but it seems there are so many people. In any case if you have any questions, you may write them down and give it to us and I hope tomorrow to answer them. Weather I answer the question it is not a guarantee that you get your Self Realization, because it is not a mental activity.

When the Kundalini rises, She takes you beyond the mental state. But as She ascends, She nourishes the centers, the subtle centers and you get physical, mental and emotional benevolence. Automatically. It is like one candle, which is enlightened, can enlighten another candle. And so you can become an enlightened person, empowered with the quality of a sage, that you can give Realizations to others. You become extremely peaceful, joyous, knowledgeable, above all you develop a very balanced personality. Despite that, you are extremely compassionate. This is your right, you have to have it. Political freedom is not the complete, total freedom. With Self Realization only, you will be totally free and you will be master of yourself, so that nothing can dominate you, no bad habits, no diseases, no negative forces, nothing can dominate you. So I hope today you'll achieve that state.

I want to have now the session for Self Realization. It will hardly take 10 minutes. It will take hardly 10 to 15 minutes. But I would request you that if you do not want Self Realization you should leave the hall and you should not disturb others during we have the session.

Hello, normally, normally we do this [UNCLEAR] sitting down but I try today even with those who are standing. Normally, normally it is done when everybody is sitting down but I will try today even with on the people are standing.

Translator: They [WANT, HAVE] to see you.

Shri Mataji: There are two conditions before we start. The first one is that you have to forget the past because it does not exist anymore. In short you should not feel guilty at all. After all you are human beings and if you have made mistakes it doesn't matter. Only human beings can make mistakes. You are not Gods. So please, first of all, know that you are not guilty at all. If you feel guilty, then the center on the left hand side here gets into trouble and then you develop diseases like spondylitis and also like angina, some heart troubles. So please do not feel guilty.

Second condition is that you have to forgive everyone, in general, not to remember whom to forgive and whom not to forgive. Whether you forgive someone or not forgive you do not do anything, you do not do anything. It is a myth that you do not forgive. But you torture yourself for this [UNCLEAR]. So, I hope you will understand when I requested you that: "Please, forgive everyone in general". Do not think about individuals. People say it is difficult, but it is just a myth. If you do not forgive, then one of the most important centers, the 6-th center on the optic chiasm cannot open and your Kundalini won't rise. First you're suffering such a lot and then you'll miss also Self Realization.

Now I cannot force on you Self Realization. You have to have the pure desire to get your Self Realization. So those who do not want I cannot force. Can I now request you to take out your shoes so that the Mother Earth also helps us? It will take hardly 15 minutes but you have to be quiet. Both the feet are to kept away from each other but those who are sitting on the ground are all right, they are [UNCLEAR]. Also those who are standing, they are all right.

You have to put your left hand towards Me which is the symbolic expression of your desire. The left side is the power of desire and the right side is the power of action. So please put your left hand on your lap or like this and be comfortable. You need not bend or you need not slouch. Sit in a comfortable way. With the right hand we have to nourish our centers on the left hand side. So first we put our right hand on our heart where resides the Spirit. But the seat of the Spirit is in the fontanel bone area, which was a soft bone in childhood. Now you have to take your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen, which is the center of your mastery. This center is created within us by great masters and prophets.

You have to take now your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen and press it hard. This is the center of pure knowledge, pure knowledge that manifests on your central nervous system. This is not just a mental conception or an imagination but is the last breakthrough of your evolution, which manifests on your nervous system. So you become, which is not just thinking but you really become an enlightened person. In Sanskrit we call it as bodha, like in Veda it is [VIDHA] means you know on your central nervous system. Now we raise our right hand again on our upper part of the abdomen, then on our heart, then in the corner of our neck and our shoulder and turn our head to our right.

Now we take this right hand on the forehead and press it both the sides, our temples and put our head down. Here we have to forgive everyone. Now we take back our hand on the backside of our head and push back our head as far as possible. Here, without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, for your satisfaction, you have to ask for forgiveness from this All Pervading Power of Pure Love. Now we stretch our palm and put the center of our palm on the fontanel bone area. And now we put down our head. Please stretch back your fingers, this is very important, so there's a lot of pressure on your scalp. Now move your scalp slowly, put down your head and now move your scalp very slowly, 7 times, clockwise, clockwise.

Now let Me say that is been committed and you did not push back your fingers. You did not push back. You have to push back your fingers; it's a push back. All right. So now we start. You can take out your spectacles. Till I tell you, please don't open your eyes. In the heart resides the Spirit. So, now close your eyes and ask a very fundamental question to Me. You can call Me Mother or Shri Mataji, whatever you like. So we have to say 3 times: "Mother, am I the Spirit?" Three times. Now if you are the Spirit then you are your light, you are your light and you are your Master.

So please take your hand, right hand, on the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side and here you ask another question, 3 times: "Mother, am I my own Master?", "Mother, am I my own Master?" I've already told you that I respect your freedom. I've already told you that I respect your freedom and I cannot force on you the pure knowledge. You have to ask. So now please take your hand in the lower portion of your abdomen and press it hard. Here you have to ask 6 times, because this center has got 6 petals. So please ask 6 times: "Mother please give me pure knowledge." As soon as you ask for pure knowledge the Kundalini starts rising. So we have to nourish the upper centers with our self-confidence.

So now, please take your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen and here you say with full self-confidence, 10 times: "Mother I am my own Master." Now, raise your right hand in the upper, on to your heart. Here resides the Spirit. So please ask a question 12 times with full confidence or say it with full confidence: "Mother, I am the Spirit." You have to know that this All Pervading Power of Pure Love is the ocean of knowledge, it is the ocean of joy but above all, it is the ocean of forgiveness and whatever mistakes you may commit it can dissolve. So now, please raise your right hand in the corner of your neck and shoulder and put your, turn to your right, fully. Here, you have to say again with full confidence 16 times: "Mother, I am not guilty at all. I'm not guilty at all. I'm not guilty at all."

I've already told you that weather you forgive or don't forgive you do not do anything. But when you do not forgive, you torture yourself. So now, take your right hand on top of your forehead and press both the temples, with your thumb and your small finger and bow the head, and put it down. Here you have to say from your heart, not how many times, not how many times: "Mother I forgive everyone." Please put down the head. Please say that from your heart. Put down the head. Now, take back your hand in the backside of your head and push back your head, as far as possible. Here, without feeling guilty, without counting mistakes, just for your satisfaction, you have to say: "Oh, All Pervading Power of Love, please forgive me if I've done any mistakes knowingly or unknowingly.

Now, please stretch your hand, stretch your palm, put the center of your palm on top of your fontanel bone area, and now press it down by putting down your head, first. And now push back your fingers. I must say that I cannot again cross over your freedom. I must say that I cannot cross over your freedom, I cannot cross over your freedom, I cannot [INTERACT] your freedom. So you have to ask for your Self Realization. So, now, put down your head and press your scalp pushing back your fingers and move your scalp with pressure 7 times, asking 7 times: "Mother, give me my Self Realization."

Now, please take down your hands and open your eyes. Put both the hands towards Me, like this. Now, put the right hand like this and put down your head and see for yourself if there's a cool breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area. Some people get it closer and some [LITTLE] away. Some people get it far, but doesn't matter. If you do not forgive then you get it hot. Now, it's not on your head, it's away from your head. Now, please put your left hand towards Me, put down your head [UNCLEAR] and now see with your right hand if there's a cool breeze coming out of your head, [UNCLEAR], please. Once more you put right hand, right hand towards Me and left hand on the top of the fontanel bone area and see for yourself if there's a cool breeze. Now raise both your hands towards the sky and push back your head and ask a question: "Mother, is this the cool breeze of the All Pervading Power of Pure Love?", "Mother, this is the cool breeze of the All Pervading Power of the Pure Love?" Ask this question 3 times

Now please take down your hands. Watch Me without thinking. Please put your hands like this. All those who have felt the cool breeze or hot breeze, on their fingers or the hands, or out of their fontanel bone area, please raise your both the hands, both the hands. Please raise both your hands. You [OR] Bulgaria has got Self Realization. I bow to you. I bow to you.

You feel the cool breeze? You feel the cool breeze? Remarkable. [AND, IN] there are so many people and I would like to meet you. I don't know how to do [THAT]. So they are going to play the music, I would request you to clap.
