Shri Durga Puja. Rahuri (India), 1 February 1982.

(Marathi transcript below)

Today is a special day. There is a combination of two things happening.

Adi mai English maday bolte pan Marathi boliye (meaning: First I will speak in English then Marathi) - below)

Today is first in the morning time, at 8:50 in the morning, was a very important day that started at 8:50 in the morning, called as Ratha Saptami - is the seventh day. And it is said that Sun travels with his seven forces, or say, seven colours in a big chariot. And today they celebrate this day as a day when Sun travels with a divine vibrations all over the world, and illumines. So it was too early for anyone of you to do this, so till...I got up very early of course and worked out that part for you.

The second important thing which is a combination, which is a very, very auspicious thing - that you get on one day, two dates. One is Ratha Saptami, on that day you cannot do havan because it is the Surya already is there. So the second thing is, [which] today we do, is a very great puja of Ashtami (eighth day): is the day when the Goddess killed nine rakshasas together with Her eight hands. So today is a very special day for which a very special attention is needed.

It's only at the behest of the bhaktas that the Goddess took Her form and killed all these rakshashas. Also with Her eight hands, She killed Mahishasura. That's why She's called as Mahishasura Mardini. She's called as Nava Chandi, one who has killed nine Chandas, means nine rakshashas She has killed. So is a very important day and very vital and very deep.

It's very simple to say, “Mother, we have fixed Your puja on such and such day.” Nobody thinks what Mother has to work behind the whole thing, you see. You can't fix My puja. It's not proper. It is I who can tell you what time is the best for you to do the puja.

So it starts at two minutes past twelve. So now we can start it and that's why I delayed my bath. But that would be too late, I started my bath little early.  Then only we can do it.

So today is the day of the Goddess, a very important day that you are here. Somehow we are having all the pujas of 9 days, and that's why I am wearing this special type of a sari, which is to be used for Ashta Puja’s. Vahana, is a tiger as well as a lion. Imagine where I'm staying, there is a photograph of a tiger and a lion both, in that room. You can go and see for yourself. Normally you never get these [together] but that is there, beautiful photograph, enlarged, a tiger and a lion.

So in the morning the Surya was very beautiful, I don't know if you saw the morning sun? At least tomorrow try to see. It's not important how long you sleep here, what food you eat, whether you get it in time and all that. You should get rid of these habits, it's very important that these regularities and all these mundane type of things, the bounding of timing and all that - you must get out of it space and time, everything. And should not go on worrying about things because you get so exhausted, without doing any work you feel exhausted. Because you are so fixed up, so fixed up that you can't get out of these habits, you see. While the Indians are not fixed up like that, they know that Mother knows the best, She will come at the time when the puja has to be done. So, one should try to understand that if I am the One then why should you worry?

But I have one problem with the Western mind is that if they cannot conceive it, they start criticising. Instead of making yourself subtler and subtler to conceive the beauty of the Divine, if you don't get it you will start criticising on any point, anything you can get hold of and you start criticising. So that's not the way we can grow. That's why I'm telling you beforehand that this puja is very important, and at this puja, you have to request that these nine Chandas, who are still there, should be killed and this Mahishasura also should be killed, they should be driven out. And that's how it is going to work out and it's very important. It’s very important, I have to work it out myself. You see, it’s not easy just to organise a programme like a, preside over something, you just come along, it is not that way. It’s much, much deeper, it is much deeper significance, much deeper work has to be done. So many things have to be worked out. It’s a very subtle thing. And the more you discuss it, the more you talk about it, you lose it, you should keep quiet and absorb it.

So today is not a day of such a mundane type, is very important in this small place,  where we are sitting, we are doing a tremendous job. And you people, who have suffered the most on account of these rakshashas, should be absolutely intensively be careful that these sinners must go out. Something has to be done. Instead of thinking about yourself and your inconveniences, your troubles and whatever you call them which are not so important at all. (a cock crows) You are saints and you must support all divine work with complete understanding. On the contrary if you are so much worried about your own things, I mean you are of no use, to yourself or Sahaja Yoga.

So I would say that even some people will see that this happened, that happened. Perhaps the group is bit too big to accommodate in all these places. I always had a feeling that the group is increasing bit too much. And we didn't have any idea of so many people coming in. But doesn’t matter - they are sharing, we are settled down, there’s a place to sleep. And if you can understand this, you see, that these things are not important then you go to England and just sleep or you go to Australia and just sleep. I mean you have all the time to do all that. Just now you are here to become subtler and subtler.

Now the time has started and the brahmin also came at the right time. So we have to be one with the subtleties. Sahaja Yoga is not possible if you want to see it from a gross level: you cannot understand Sahaja Yoga that way. I have already told you that without realisation,you cannot have Sahaja Yoga. But even after realisation, if you stick on to those old things which belongs to the egg time, you will have no advantage. So try to become subtler and subtler, and don't think about it. You will relax, you will feel better, it will act. [Don’t think] that you should have food at the right time, you must have this at the right time, this should be the food. This is, I mean, its such a stuck up thing, you know. We cannot be stuck up with food, we cannot be stuck up with all these things. You are going to a level where nobody has reached. With this understanding if we become surrendered - means not to give Me anything but to get rid of your ego and your stuck up ideas which there have been - it would be a very good thing.

When you discuss also among yourselves, nobody should discuss inconveniences. I had told you that in a village it's a very difficult thing . You don't have to go to Himalayas but traveling through India is not an easy thing, and I had told all of you. I live with much more conveniences and comforts than anyone of you live but I can adjust myself much more, so you should also try to forget about it. Don't talk of your inconveniences. That will make you very gross. The one who becomes subtler and subtler can only achieve something.

(Marathi translation follows)

Today is Ashatmi, wah (wow), and morning is Rath Saptami. Getting a puja on Ashtami is a very big thing and at Rahuri my maternal home is also there. On this day of Ashatmi we celebrate this day, Rama Devi as Ashta Bhuja Devi who made great conquests, prominent conquests being the killing of the big, big bad rakshasas, destroying them killing them. She is called as Nav Chandi, also as Chandika, Ashta Bhuja, Durga etc. many other names are there and She has destroyed all these Chanda, Munda and others, all the nav chandas, that is why She is called Nav Chandi. She has also destroyed mahishasura and after killing mahishasura, the Gods showered praises on Her, but those bhaktas who called Her, they were all very dharmic, sattvik, with very good qualities. Having been very much pleased with their qualities, the Devi took incarnation. So those qualities should be in us. What are our feelings towards the Devi. Mataji, we have fixed Your puja, just like we have arranged one programme, so You please come. In many villages, Mataji, we have kept the puja at this time, keeping will not do, and you cannot keep like this. If I am pleased, I will sit for the puja, otherwise not, it depends on Me. You have to invite the Devi first, pacharan is there, etc etc. Otherwise the Devi will not sit ............... Devi is not in need of the puja, you are in need of the puja. She has to be pleased, when the Devi is prasannachitta [unclear] Her children have made lot of mistakes .........Her children are still making mistakes. They have shraddha (faith), some have shraddha but make mistakes, in some there is no shraddha at all but are superficial, they will outwardly show they are very good, seeing all these things the Devi's mind becomes saddened and feels why the puja should be given to such people who do not deserve this.

So you should become sadguni. In sadgunas, the highest quality is, Shankaracharya, Adi Shankaracharya was asked, “Which is the greatest quality?” He said “Devi bhakti, Mother's bhakti.” She is Devi your Mother is the Devi. Understanding that you should do Her bhakti. In that bhakti there should not be any falsehood. The first quality, the highest quality, if it is seen in a human being from his heart, all his bad qualities will be destroyed, he will get light and attain moksha (liberation). That is why Shankaracharya has always praised the Devi. In the beginning He has described a lot, written lots of books like Vivekachudamani etc. Lastly He said that, “By only pleasing the Devi one can get everything, then why do these things? Why to do debates? Why to do discourses and break one's head? Just praise the Devi and you will get whatever one wants.” His intelligence very few people have. When that intelligence comes into us, then you will get the authority. The same way without doing anything also I am prasannachitta now and any number of mistakes you make I will forgive them all, without doing that it will not be possible because I have come with a very big heart and will forgive all your mistakes, but deceiving Me you should not do, and all the time crying and repeatedly saying that, “I have committed mistakes,” will also not do, then it becomes problem for the Devi.

You should ask for forgiveness from the Devi and take a vow today that hereafter we will not repeat the mistakes. Today's ashtami is called as Bhishma Ashtami, Bhishma Ashtami, now Bhishma had taken vow which you all know, that vow was never broken by him under any circumstances, therefore today you have to take a vow, this ashtami you all take vow that , because of this vow all the world will be benefited from it fruits, you should not think how will it happen, from this small place, this is a very big centre, so whatever vow you take now with complete devotion and utmost faith, the fruits of which will be for the whole world, that is how you should think.

(Talk continues in English)

Today is another day, is called Bhishma Ashtami, is the day when Bhishma, who was a great saint who took a great vow and that vow he carried out all his life. It was a great vow he took. So today also is the day of a vow. He took on an Ashtami day. On the Ashtami day he took a vow. So today is another day for you to take a vow. So also you should try to take a vow and with that vow, you should be able to achieve something which has not been yet achieved.

This achievement is not only for this place, is not only for Maharashtra, it is not only for India, it is not only for the whole world, but for the whole Universe. So you are playing a very important, vital role and one should try to improve one's quality of life, quality of personality. Unless and until you have that substantial quality, nothing is going to work out. This is what I am telling them: that you must work out in such a way that you become substantially dedicated to Sahaja Yoga. Not just for your sake, not just for your family or for your country but for the whole Universe. So you are the seeds who are going to create that great atmosphere that will bring forth the great change that we are expecting of Mahayoga. It is very important to understand that so many people have talked about this and I have come across a book which was written 2000 years back which describes about this Mahayoga and what is going to happen. It's very interesting. After the puja and havan, I think Mr. Chauhan will translate it to you and you can understand what is about. So let us start now.

(Puja starts with discussion in Marathi with Mother about who to call for doing puja)

Now pay attention to Sahaja Yoga and not to other things. That’s important. You should not play about. This is important. I’m just telling, it’s very vital.

In India, the custom is the wife has to sit next to the husband always for anything, for food, or for anything but in England is just the other way around.

Teenus couples? (meaning: only 3 couples?)

Because the, we would like to have couples today, alright?

आजची अष्टमी आहे आणि सकाळी रथसप्तमी! अष्टमीच्या दिवशी पूजन मिळणं ही फार मोठी गोष्ट आहे. आणि राहुरीला, हे माझं माहेरघर आहे. या ठिकाणी पूजन झालं हे त्याहून विशेष आहे. ह्या अष्टमीच्या दिवशी आपण तो दिवस साजरा करतो जेव्हा देवीने अष्टभुजा देवी बनून जगात फार पराक्रम केले. मुख्य पराक्रम म्हणजे जे मोठे मोठे दुष्ट राक्षस होते त्यांचं हनन करणं, त्यांचा नाश करणं. तिला नवचंडी असं म्हणतात, चण्डिका ही अष्टभुजा आहे. दुर्गा.. वगैरे तिची अनेक नावं आहेत. आणि तिने ह्या सर्व चंड-मुंड आदी ह्या अशा नवचंडांचा नाश केलेला आहे , म्हणून तिला नवचंडी म्हणतात. इतकंच नव्हे, महिषासुरासारख्या राक्षसाचासुद्धा तिने वध केलेला आहे. त्याच्यानंतर, महिषासुराला मारल्यावर देवांनी तिची फार भक्ती केली आणि तिचं भजन केलं. पण ज्या भक्तांनी तिला बोलवलं ते अत्यंत धार्मिक, सात्विक आणि अत्यंत गुणी होते. त्यांच्या गुणावर प्रसन्न होऊन देवीने अवतार घेतलेला आहे. तेव्हा आपल्यामध्येही ते गुण बाणले गेले पाहिजेत. आपला देवीवर काय अधिकार? 'माताजी, आम्ही तुमची पूजा ठेवली आहे. म्हणजे जसं काही आम्ही एखादा कार्यक्रम ठेवलेला आहे, तिथे तुम्ही या, प्रेसिडेंट बनून,' तसा काहीतरी प्रकार आहे. म्हणजे पुष्कळदा म्हणतात, माताजी आम्ही पूजा 'ह्या' वेळेला ठेवली. तसं ठेवून चालायचं नाही. तशी ठेवता येत नाही. आम्ही असलो प्रसन्न तर बसू पूजेला, नाहीतर नाही. आमच्या ह्याच्यावर अवलंबुन असतं, तर म्हणून देवीला आधी बोलवावं लागतं, आमंत्रण द्यावं लागतं. पाचारण असतं, वगैरे वगैरे ... ती काय अशी येऊन बसत नाही- "आता तुम्ही ठेवली आहे तर आम्ही बरोबर घड्याळाला येऊन बसलो बुवा, करा आमची पूजा!" कारण देवीला पूजेची गरज नाही, पूजेची गरज तुम्हाला आहे. तेव्हा प्रसन्नचित्त देवी असायला पाहिजे आणि तिची प्रसन्नता, जेव्हा तिला असं दिसतं की तिच्या मुलांनी चुका केलेल्या आहेत, तिची मुलं अजून फार चुका करत आहेत आणि त्यांच्यामध्ये जी श्रद्धा आहे त्यात खोटेपणा आहे... काही काही लोकांच्यामध्ये. काहींमध्ये श्रद्धा आहेत पण चुका आहेत. काहींच्यामध्ये श्रद्धाच नाहीये, खोटेपणा आहे, वरपांगीपणा आहे, काहीतरी आतमध्ये विष असून वरून दाखवतात की आम्ही फार चांगले आहोत. ह्या सर्व गोष्टी पाहिल्या म्हणजे देवीचंही मन रुष्ट होतं आणि तिला वाटतं, कशाला ह्यांना पूजा द्यायची. हे ह्या योग्यतेला नाहीत. तेव्हा सद्गुणी झालं पाहिजे. सद्गुणामध्ये सगळ्यात मोठा गुण शंकराचार्यांना, आदिशंकराचार्यांना विचारलं की सगळ्यात मोठा गुण कोणता? तर त्यांनी सांगितलं देवीभक्ती, आईभक्ती ! ती देवी आहे, तुमची आई देवी आहे हे समजून तिची भक्ती करा. आणि त्या भक्तीमध्ये खोटेपणा नसला पाहिजे. पहिला गुण, सर्वोत्तम गुण हा आहे की ज्या माणसामध्ये हृदयापासून देवीबद्दल भक्ती असेल त्याचे सर्व दुर्गुण नष्ट होतील, त्याला प्रकाश मिळेल, मोक्ष मिळेल. म्हणून त्यांनी नेहमी देवीची स्तुती केली आहे, सुरुवातीला पुष्कळ त्यांनी वर्णन केलं, आणखीन, पुष्कळ त्यांनी मोठमोठाले 'विवेकचूडामणी', वगैरे पुस्तकं लिहिली. पण शेवटी त्यांनी नुसतं म्हटलं, 'देवीला फक्त प्रसन्न केलं की सगळं मिळतं तर कशाला करायला पाहिजे काही? एवढे वादविवाद तरी कशाला करायचे, एवढं विवेचन तरी कशाला करायचं, एवढं डोकं कशाला फोडायचं, आपलं बस, देवीची स्तुती करा म्हणजे झालं, सगळं काही जे मिळायचं ते मिळतं.' त्यांचं शहाणपण फार कमी लोकांना असतं. सांगायचं म्हणजे असं ! ते शहाणपण जेव्हा आपल्यामध्ये येईल तेव्हा मग तुमचा अधिकार देवीवर होतो. तसंच, काहीही न करतानासुद्धा आता आम्ही प्रसन्नच आहोत तुमच्यावर आणि तुम्ही किती चुका केल्या तरी त्या सर्व आम्ही क्षमा करतो. तसं केल्याशिवाय व्हायचं नाही म्हणून. फार मोठ्ठं हृदय घेऊन आलोय. आणि सर्व तुमच्या चुका आम्ही क्षमा करतो. पण खोटेपणा मात्र आमच्याबरोबर केला नाही पाहिजे. दुसरं असं की 'आमचं चुकलं .. चुकलं' म्हणून सारखं रडतही बसलं नाही पाहिजे. तसं केलं तरसुद्धा देवीला त्रासच होतो. तेव्हा, काय चुकलं माकलं तर क्षमा करा, आता आम्ही पुढे करणार नाही, अशी आज तुम्ही प्रतिज्ञा केली पाहिजे कारण आजची अष्टमीला भीष्मअष्टमी असं म्हणतात. भीष्मअष्टमी! आता भीष्माचं काय होतं - भीष्मांनी प्रतिज्ञा केली होती तुम्हाला माहितीय आणि ती, कोणत्याही स्थितीत त्याने ती प्रतिज्ञा मोडलेली नाही. तेव्हा आज प्रतिज्ञा करण्याचा एक दिवस आहे, म्हणून ह्या अष्टमीला तुम्ही जी प्रतिज्ञा कराल त्या प्रतिज्ञेप्रमाणे सर्व जगाला त्याचं फळ मिळणार आहे. म्हणजे ह्या लहानशा जागेत आपण बसलो आहे , तर इथं आपलं हे लावलेलं आहे आणि ही सगळी काही व्यवस्था केलेली आहे, म्हणजे असा विचार नाही केला पाहिजे की इथे कसं होणार? हे फार मोठ्ठं, आपण केंद्र आहे, ह्या वेळेला. जिथे आम्ही बसलो तिथे सर्व विश्वाचं केंद्र आलेलं आहे. तेव्हा ह्या वेळेला ज्या तुम्ही पूर्ण मनाने, पूर्ण भक्तीने जी तुम्ही प्रतिज्ञा कराल त्याचं फळ सर्व संसाराला मिळणार आहे असं समजलं पाहिजे.
