Part 1

[Voice off]: Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi, the most important spiritual figure in the world today. Please join us on a special program of “Audrey Hope’s real women”

Interviewer: My name is Audrey Hopes and welcome to ‘Real women”. It is a great honour to be in the presence of the most important spiritual figure in the world today, Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi.

Shri Mataji is a world leader and has travelled the globe many times over to give Self Realization to thousands.
Self Realization is the pure connexion with our spiritual nature and is the only hope for a stable society. Today is that day prophesized by the saints.
Once you may have needed to travel to the Himalayas or to meditate on a mountain for twenty years, but now, through the grace of Shri Mataji, there is a simple way to achieve that connexion and that is through Sahaja Yoga. Shri Mataji founded Sahaja Yoga as a method for human beings to experience the truth within and to become your own master. Shri Mataji is a mother and a grandmother, a true role model for all human beings.
Shri Mataji was a spiritual guide for Mahatma Gandhi. She accepts no money for Realization and she says the truth cannot be paid for.
She joins us after her fourth visit to the United Nations and before her journey to Washington DC.
Shri Mataji is known all over the world. She is less known in the United States. Well, it is here, in the mist of media and its power, where she is needed the most.
Shri Mataji, we are deeply honoured to have you here, thank you.

Shri Mataji: Thank you very much.

Interviewer: I’d like to begin by speaking about Self Realization and to tell the viewers what Self Realization is.
Shri Mataji: Within yourself lies a power which is called in Sanskrit language as Kundalini, which is in the sacrum bone. That means definitely, that the Greeks knew this was a sacred bone where that power was lying. This is the power which connects you to the All-pervading Power.
Now the truth is that we are not this body, this mind, this ego, these conditionings. But you are the pure Spirit because you say: “My ego, my body”, you are the pure Spirit, this is one truth about yourself. Another truth is that there is the All-pervading Power of divine love. It’s called by various names. You see these beautiful flowers; it’s a miracle itself. And who runs our heart? We never inquire, we don’t find by doctors will tell you it’s the autonomous nervous system. But who is this “auto”?
So these two things we have to realize that we are the pure Spirit and there is an All-pervading Power of divine love. Power of love, not of hatred.

Interviewer: How does one receive Self Realization? Does a person have to give up their personal life or self problems before they can attain this?
Shri Mataji: It’s very simple, that within our being, a complete machinery is already made through our evolutionary process. And we have seven centres, main seven centres placed on our central nervous system, or we can call it on the parasympathetic and ultimately, this power raises, penetrates through these six centres only, ultimately, pierces through the fontanel bone area and connects you to that All-pervading Power.
While it is travelling through these charkas or the centres or the energy centres we can call them, it nourishes them. Not only it nourishes, it integrates them and it enlightens them.
Most of the problems, global problems, are because of human beings. And most of the human problems are because of these centres. Because these centres cater to our physical, mental, emotional and spiritual needs. So once these centres are out of gear, we have all these problems whether on an individual basis or on a collective basis.
So when this connects to the All-pervading Power, then you achieve a new state of awareness. So there’s a breakthrough in your evolution.
Evolution process is spontaneous. We have not paid for it, we didn’t do anything, we are becoming human beings. So now, the last one, why should we pay for it? Or why should we do anything about it?

Interviewer: Does one need blind faith or can this be approached as you say, or how is it approached like a science?
Shri Mataji: It’s just a living process. You try to understand this way, that this Mother earth is there. What we have to do is to put one seed in it and the seed sprouts. How? Because it is built in, in the seed to sprout and built in, in the Mother Earth to make it sprout. It’s as simple as that.

Interviewer: We Americans are very into scientific proof. [Laughter]
And you describe Sahaja Yoga as an essence of all religions and not just a religion. How is Sahaja Yoga different?
Shri Mataji: “Saha” means “with”. “Ja” means born. Born with you is the right to have this union, the Yoga. That is Sahaja Yoga.
By this union, you realize that all the religions were flowers born on one tree of spirituality. But we have plucked the flowers and now we are fighting with the dead flowers. If there is one God then why could we-how could we fight in the name of God?
This is the philosophy of Gandhiji also. We also followed the same philosophy not only but, as we worship all the incarnations and all the prophets and all messiahs, in the same way, he said we have to worship them. It’s not just to show respect but you must worship the same way. That is Sahaj religion which encompasses all the religions and also respects because in essence all of them are the same. And if there is one singular message in all these religions is that: “Seek your Self to be born again”. That’s the message in all the religions.

Interviewer: So where has the religion gone wrong? We are- let’s take Christianity for example.
Shri Mataji: Christianity has gone wrong at a very early stage I should say, where it was taken over by Paul. I asked my father when I first saw his name in the Bible, I said: “Who is this Mister Paul?” He said: “He is a squatter. He had nothing to do with Christ. He never met Christ. He had actually killed so many Christians, he has killed the disciple of Christ called Steven. But being a bureaucrat, he thought it was a good platform to jump onto the platform of Christianity. And he had to have help from somebody, one of the disciples. The worse disciple of Christ was Peter, so he grabbed Peter and has written the Bible”.
Despite all the things they have done, that Christ told Peter that “Satan will catch hold of you’ it’s clearly said. Now this Mister Peter and Mister Paul put together tried to spoil all the great work of our Lord Jesus-Christ because, first of all, the worst for women. Paul hated women from his heart. And that’s why even for Christ’s Mother, he uses a word like “woman”. To us, she is a Goddess. She is a Mahalakshmi, to Sahaja Yogis. But to him, she was just a woman. And the way he has conducted the whole thing has brought such a disaster on the women of the West. Even now, up till now, women are treated as something very low for spirituality.

But in India, a woman is the shakti, is the power. Another great mistake they have committed is in describing the Trinity. We have God the father, God the son and the third one is a Holy Ghost, is a dove. How can you have a father and a son and no mother?
But there is a Primordial Mother which was accepted by all the religions even the Jews had it. Greeks called it Athena. “Atha” in Sanskrit means “primordial”. Athena. In India, this is called as Adi Shakti. In every religion, they had this Mother who was the Primordial Mother.
So he cancelled all the powers of a mother and that is how the women have a very inferiority complex, I think, or insecurity in the Western world.

Because they think we have to, all the time, be apologetical [unsure] and we should always serve the men and we should sell our body, we should make ourselves very attractive, otherwise, we have no place! And that is how the morality of women is shattered.

Interviewer: I wanted to use a quote from that [pensée? French word?] in "Timothy 1" to really emphasise this point. It says in the Bible, “A woman should learn in quietness and full submission. I do not present a woman to teach or to have authority over a man; she must be silent. For Adam was formed first, then Eve. And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived and became a sinner. [The New Testament, 1 Timothy 2:9-14]

Shri Mataji: That’s also a mistake about Adam and Eve also. But that, I’ll deal later on. But a simple thing is that it was a complete attack on womanhood. And that’s how women have accepted- imagine such a developed country like England, was discussing till yesterday, whether a woman should preach or not.
Yes! I mean, now, with great difficulty, some people have agreed that women should preach.
I just don’t understand. In India, a woman is very powerful. She doesn’t care for her husband if he goes after another woman. She says: “Alright, he’s sinful, let him go to Hell. I don’t care.” She stands on her own merit on her chastity. She doesn’t bother.

Now, the whole situation is so bad, that women have to be, all the time, trying to, you see, expose their body also. I haven’t seen a single film in which a man is exposed. It’s always the women [who] must be exposed as if men are some Sanctum sanctorum.
I feel the slavery of women is much more in the West than in India.

Interviewer: And how about the Koran? I’m speaking about the Iranians. I know you did a programme this week and it was a very important programme. And I’d like to talk about how the Iranian people have misinterpreted Mohamed and the effects on their society and the importance of their changing for women. [unsure]

Shri Mataji: Yes. Even Muhammad Sahib, you see, he respected women so much. You know, they used to have wars. They were tribes. They were tribal people. It was only Muhammad Sahib who could take birth in those horrible Arabs. And he found that so many men, young men were killed. So he said: “Alright. If there are not young men, let the old men marry, even young girl. It doesn’t matter but marry. Even if they have to marry five times, marry so that they do not become prostitutes. Just to respect their chastity he prescribed this thing but it is not compulsory that you should marry five times. You see, we have horrible things in India. A man marries four times, has eight children each time because they believe that but that democracy [demography?], they’ll be powerful.
Then, after some time, they divorce their wives by saying three times: “Talaq, talaq, talaq.” [repudiation].
Now, these women are with so many children, are just left on the street. And if you see them you’ll think that this is worse than Somalia.

He respected women! Not only, he told his wife that: “You are going to work out- Aicha” he told her: “You are going to work out something against the religion.” And really it was wrong on her because his own daughter, as you know her name was Fatima, stood up and said that: “This, never Muhammad Sahib has said it.” But this Abu-Bakr is a fellow who just took the platform, as it is, I should say, instead of his own son in law, Hazrat Ali, who was a great Realized soul. And he just completely changed the ideas about women which Fatima was going to tell.
So there were big wars called Karbala in which two children of Fatimabi were killed, Hazrat Ali was also killed and there two groups which were formed, one is Shia and Sunni.

But Shias also don’t understand that they have to respect their women because Fatimabi herself was a, not only a saint but an incarnation. She was a Goddess.

Interviewer: How has the media affected our view of women today?
Shri Mataji: In the Western media I must say that women are used just to lure or some sort of a very low type of human beings I should say. Men are not sex points. They are the Spirit. They are reduced to this sex point by Freud. And Freud was like a Christ here once upon a time. Now of course, after so many years, I said this at least twenty years back. But now it is appearing, many- I’ve seen some books like “Fall of Freudian Empire” “Freudian Freud”, so many books are coming now! Already all the harm has been done! Human beings are reduced to a sex point now by media and women who are very cheap who can expose their body and can sell their chastity are regarded as great heroines. This is what? It’s the situation of the media that is today.

Interviewer: I heard you have even said that Freud can only prosper in America.
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Interviewer: Freud can only prosper in America.
Shri Mataji: Yes.
Interviewer: You said that.
Shri Mataji: It’s a fact.
He was born in Austria and when I talked against Freud they all clapped. They were very happy I said so because they were quite ashamed about him. But even in Austria, you find so many prostitutes on the streets, standing all the while. But here, at least, there it is, the housewives are housewives.
Here, even housewife has to dress up in such a way that she should be like a prostitute. Why should you do that? You must have your self-respect.

Interviewer: How is this special time for women?
Shri Mataji: I call it this a Blossom time because I say they are many flowers, so many some of them are on the Earth and they are to become now fruits. But it’s called as Qiyamah in the Koran, meaning the Resurrection time.
Even in the Indian scriptures, we have this Resurrection time and by many astrologers, thousands of years back, it was predicted that such and such time will come. And also in the Bible, it is the Last Judgement.
There’s another stupid idea which we find in Bible and also in Koran, which is very stupid, and I think also- I don’t know about the Torah, but they said that there is also the same idea previously – that, at the time of Resurrection our dead bodies will come out of the graves and then they’ll ascend. Now, tell Me what is left in the grave of the dead bodies? It is so absurd, it’s so illogical.
Actually, in that way, I would say Indian scriptures said the correct thing that at this time of Kali Yuga all the souls which are lost, all the souls who want their Realization, all the souls who have been thinking of God and seeking God all over the world, will be reborn. That’s why we have a population problem. That is why all kinds of horrible people are also born. In this time, about twenty years back, your media was much better. They didn’t show such horrible scenes. I mean they must show bedroom’s scenes, what is the need? Bathroom scenes. I mean, if somebody comes into your house, do you take them to your bedroom, into your bathroom or you keep them in the dining room? I mean, it’s private life. They have no respect for privacy.

Now, you see, this kind of funny idea that we are going to get out of the graves and all that is still lingering in the mind of many ignorant Christians and also Muslims. One Bosnia fellow met Me, he was Muslim. I asked him: “Why were you dying there, what was the need to die?” He said: “Because if we die now in the name of God, we’ll be resurrected.”
[Interviewer is laughing.]
Shri Mataji: I mean it is relevant from the idea of Bible, you see? So this is what it is that these ideas are to be put right.

In the west, you see, we have Christianity, we have other religions. But, I would say that the roots of the spiritual knowledge, it’s more in India. I’m myself born in a Christian religion. But the roots about it, the explanation about it, is much better discovered in India because it’s an ancient country which has been all the times seeking, seeking, for thousands of years.

Now the system that is Sahaja Yoga as you mentioned is not mine. It’s an ancient system. But we had this system in the Nath Panthis, they call it, that they were in the centre. And one master will have only one disciple, this was the tradition. So there were very few people who got their Realization. Shri Rama’s father-in-law’s guru was Ashtavakra. He has written about sahaj. But he has just described what happens when you get into the state of Spirit. This father-in-law, Janaka, gave Realization to only one person Natchiketa according to the tradition.
But, on the twelve century, there was a great poet in India, in Maharashtra, born as Gnyaneshwara, who asked his guru, his own brother that: “Let me also tell about this.” He said: "All right”. He permitted. So in his Gnyaneshwari which is just the explanation of Gita, he has clearly said in the sixth chapter about Kundalini, how she rises, how she gives you Realization and everything. But those people who were in charge of religion, as usual, didn’t know how to do it. So what they did, they said:” This is "nisidhat" [forbid] - means, cancelled- you don’t read this sixth chapter.” So nobody would read that chapter. That’s how it went into background!

So I would say, after that, many great saints like Guru Nanak, Kabir, Sukarama, Ramdas, in the sixteen century, did a great work of Kundalini [inaudible]. Even in the Bible, it is: “I will appear before you as tongues of flames.” “Tree of life” so many things are described!

But in the little time that they had, they could not explain so much. Now, these people have talked about Kundalini and said about it. If I have done any work, is this, that by studying through human beings, I met many people because my father was a very social man and my husband was in a position where I met many people. I studied human beings and I found out a method by which you can now give a-mass Realization.
In Russia, in Bulgaria, Romania, we always have people in the stadium, not less than sixteen thousand, and they all get their Realization! And they are very sensitive to spirituality and they stick to it. None of these false gurus could stick there.

Interviewer: Psychics, the issue of psychics, it’s so popular here! And we are very-it’s very dangerous. Could you explain what can happen?
Shri Mataji: Ah. Americans are very simple people I must say. First time I came for parapsychology, they took Me into a hall of parapsychology. They told Me: "You are dealing with dead spirits!" And they were very angry with Me. He says that: "You come as guest and why do crusade? [unsure]." I said: "I have to tell you the truth, I am your Mother. I’m not your guest, you didn’t pay for Me. I came on my own, coming on my vehicle and going on my vehicle", while they made money out of Me. So, they don’t like it.
When I first came here, when I told them that: "These are all spirits and psychic things and don’t do it”, they didn’t like it.

Interviewer: How can we know of false guru?
Shri Mataji: First of all, you cannot pay for your Self Realization! Or for any knowledge. You must value your life. If you don’t value your life, then you’ll go to all such stupid people and you’ll waste your time. No, if you value you life, if you value your money for example, you’ll first find out what it this you are buying. First of all you must see the disciples, what are they doing, what is their style what are they gaining, what is their knowledge. First the disciples! Most of them are recluses.

Anything which is sort of fashionable, people want to do. You talk of individuality, all right? Any entrepreneur, now they just started a six inches of skirt, everybody wears six inches of skirt! Otherwise you are not “in”, means in the lunatic asylum.
So like that, these people are good at big advertisement, marketing, writing books, all falsehood! You believe them because they have a knack, advertisement is the main thing which has led to this kind of things and Americans are really very sensitive to advertising. If anything is advertised, they think it’s great.
Also I was surprised when I came here, they asked Me – in Boston, I remember- they asked Me: "How many Roll Royce you have?", in the television. I said: "I don’t have!" They said then: "You don’t make any money." "No." I said: "I don’t make any money." "So there’s no business." "No", I said "no". "Then we are not interested." They wouldn’t have Me on the television. I mean you are so money oriented that tomorrow you’ll purchase God also I think.
So, first of all, you cannot pay for it.
Second, you must see the disciples, what sort of disciples they are, what they are, how much they are talking about the knowledge. They must have the knowledge. Now you know very well, and people can find out that in Sahaja Yoga people just get Realization and start giving Realizations to others. So many diseases have been cured. It’s a fact, there’s a book written.

Interviewer: So we are in a new stage, a new evolution.
Shri Mataji: Of course, this is the time, if you miss it, you’ll miss it for ever! Because, you see, otherwise, you see in America, people are getting destroyed from within. All kinds of diseases, psychological problems, this, that, stress, this, that, all kind of things are going on.
Now, to stop it, better ascend above all these things.

Interviewer: Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi.
Please join us for part two of this special program on “Audrey Hope’s real women”.

Part 2

1993-10-11 Shri Mataji, ‘Reel Women’ Interview, P2, Los Angeles, USA,

Interviewer – Welcome Shri Mataji!

Shri Mataji – Thank You.

Interviewer – What is human evolution? What it is the next step in human evolution?

Shri Mataji – Next Step is to become the spirit which you are. You are the pure spirit, you are not this body, mind, ego, all your conditionings but you are the pure spirit and that’s what you have to become. In evolutionary process, you have become a human being, in human awareness we have not been able to reach the absolute truth. If we had reached the absolute truth there would have been no problems, no quarrelling, no arguments and no wars but because we are all holding something as truth which is not absolute that’s why we are fighting. 

Interviewer – You describe Self-realization as a living process of the kundalini where you can feel on your central nervous system.  Can you explain?

Shri Mataji – Yes. We have evolved so far through a process of evolution which is spontaneous, which is a living process and now once this evolutionary process takes place, when you become the spirit, then you achieve so many of your powers which are not yet known to you.

Interviewer – What is the cool breeze that you experience and what is the reference to the Holy Ghost?         

Shri Mataji – So this done through a power which is called as kundalini in your sacrum bone which is the sacred bone. It’s like any connection you have to put; supposing you have a television and if it is not connected to the mains it looks like just a box in the same way we think we are the boxes but once we are connected then we realise how many things (can) are there, which we have never knew that we owned them, we are the power of that. Actually this is your own power to begin with and the manifestation of this when it is connected to the mains to the all-pervading power of divine love then the first thing you feel is the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost coming out of your head. It is the reflection of the Holy Ghost is this kundalini or we call it as  Adishakti. Then this comes out of your head you can clearly feel the cool breeze coming out of your head. Also you can feel them on your fingertips, when you feel them on your fingertips actually it is on your central nervous system you can feel those centres which are actually, are the last points of the sympathetic nervous system. So the right side you can feel the physical and the mental problems of your centres and on the left hand side you can feel the emotional problems of your centres. If this is decode properly, then you can feel your own centres so the first thing you get is self knowledge; knowledge about yourself; now many people who get diseases they don’t know they have got disease they have to go through diagnosis, this that, here you don’t have to do anything like that you just on fingertips you can feel it. What’s wrong with you physically or mentally, emotionally or what’s wrong with you spiritually because you might have gone to some false person, there must be some spiritual problem in you, everything can be verified on these fingertips. In Koran is described that’s when resurrection time will come your hands will speak and they will give witness against you, its very clearly described.

Interviewer – And we are in this special time?

Shri Mataji – Yes of course, this is the special time of resurrection when you do feel that. Not only that but when this Kundalini rises then all these centres are nourished, integrated and enlightened and you get the well-being of your physical side, mental side, emotional side and spiritual side as a result you become extremely calm, peaceful, healthy. We are all the time thinking about future and past, one thought rises falls another thought rises falls, in between these thoughts there is a little space, we live in the past or the future, the little space is the present. We can’t live in the present, when this kundalini rises she  elongates those thoughts and the space in between increases and you become thoughtlessly aware in Sanskrit it is called as ‘Nirvichar Samadhi’ that your awareness becomes thoughtlessly aware. You see everything, know everything but you are thoughtless so thus your peace is established. If there is no peace within whats use of talking about peace; having conference of peace, organisations of peace, there should be peace within. I have known people you have got peace awards, one of the most hot tempered people so how can they have peace award, I don’t know they have got peace award alright so doesn’t matter. Now this is what is the first achievement is that you feel thoughtlessly aware, then you can feel on your fingertips also the centres of others that means you are collectively conscious. This is second dimension in your awareness, who is the other you become part and parcel of the whole so you can feel the chakras of another person not only that but sitting down here you can feel anybody’s chakras and if you know how to correct yours, you can correct yours and if you know how to correct others, you can correct that; thus you can correct all the chakras and you can solve the problems. Another thing that happens to you is that you attention becomes very pure, there is no lust and greed in your attention, it becomes innocent, you look at things innocently. In Sahaja yoga now we have so many people but I have never heard of anybody’s wife running away with somebody or nothing, the flirting, all that is finished now. They are just like children, very innocent people like angels. This attention is also active, when you pay attention to (some) somebody, it acts, it works, it heals, it helps, it’s remarkable because the kingdom of God is the most efficient kingdom you could think of and it is work with the all the subtle of all the elements like it has a subtle of the ether, subtle of the earth, all these things are control by this all pervading power and once you are connected with it, you know that whatever you desire, whatever you want happens. A person becomes extremely creative, I have known many artist from India who have become now world famous, have got realisation and became. They were Muslims, Hindus all kinds of people then you transcend all the limitation of this artificial life, transcend the limitation of these outside religions and your inner religion, innate religion starts manifesting by which you really become really become religious. Its not that ,eh, you may be Christian, Hindu, Muslim but you can commit any sin, anybody, no you do not commit any sins anybody, you just become an angel you can call it as saint.  The religion is inside which enlighten and if you are a Christian, you become real Christian; if you are Hindu, you become real Hindu and the all the system which is inside is enlightened in such way that you just don’t do wrong thing. For example I have known so many people who came to me who were drug addicts and overnight, over night, after Self-realization they have given up. Alcoholism, all bad habits, all kinds of diseases are cured, even cancer, even AIDS. I must say this is not that difficult because their mentality is different but it has cured many diseases and you feel your well being when you get your Self-realization.          

Interviewer –  Shri Mataji, what would happen to those who don’t hear the call, pay attention to these special times?

Shri Mataji – See, it is Judgement and human beings are free to judge. They want to come to reality they can come, if they don’t want to come we cannot force, we cannot force. You have to respect the freedom of their choice, whatever they want to do but  those you won’t come – I don’t know what will happen to them but they will be in the same problems that they had and as you see this world is getting destroyed from within so to get out of it is the better idea. 

Interviewer –  And America plays a very important role in this new time as a communicator?

Shri Mataji – Of course, this is a country of Communication. The other day somebody asked a question, Why should America be a Policemen everywhere?Jolly well it has to be because that’s the character it is born. Is this centre is America and because America is not alright I have a problem. So, this is the centre is for all kinds of communications and for collectivity. Always you’ll find Americans bear the collective responsibilities of the world problems, sometime they make mistakes, it’s different, but by nature they have to do it, they can’t help it, that is their nature.

Interviewer –  It has been said that you are the Holy Ghost? 

Shri Mataji – Ya. 

Interviewer – Is this true?

Shri Mataji – You are in this part. I have to say that I must be something, Isn’t it? After all, when I am giving realization to thousands of people I must be something and some people must have found out something. But as far as the people are concerned I would say I’ve learnt a lesson because Christ who was the son of God was crucified, who said who was the son of God. Mohammad Sahab was given poison, everybody was troubled like this. Now, I don’t want to get crucified, I want to do my work till I live alright so that’s why I don’t want to say anything, once you get your Self-realization you will find out who am I?  

Interviewer – May we do that right now?

Shri Mataji – Yes why not? Why not? First you have to put your shoes away because the Mother Earth helps us a lot. Now, please put both your hands towards me like this. Left hand towards me in a very comfortable position you can put it on your lap you have to become very comfortable you don’t have to go to Himalayas as we have said it, you have to become comfortable and right hand you have to give realization in a way that left hand is for your desire and right hand is for your action. In the same way your feet should be away from each other if you are sitting on the chair but if you are on the ground it’s alright. Now please put your left hand towards me like this and the right hand on your heart. We have to nourish our centres only on the left hand side; in the heart resides the spirit. Now if you become the spirit, you become your own master so take down your right hand upper portion of your abdomen; here is the centre of your mastery created by all the prophets and all the incarnations. Now take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side and press it hard. This is the centre for pure divine knowledge, pure divine knowledge. This you will understand later on when you will come to our centres, they will explain to you everything and you can find out everything about this knowledge which is like an ocean. Now raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen again on the left hand side. Now raise it on your heart, now you have to put your right hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder and turn your head to your right. Now take your right hand on top of your forehead and put down your head, this is a centre where you have to forgive everyone now take your hand on the back side of your head and push back your head, here without counting your mistakes or feeling guilty you have to ask forgiveness from the all pervading divine power. Now stretch your arm, stretch your palm fully and put the centre of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area which was a soft bone in your childhood. Now please put down your head and now push back your fingers and move your scalp clockwise slowly, push back your finger so there is a good pressure on your scalp, now put down your head and now move your scalp slowly clockwise. That’s all we have to do.

Now put the right hand on your heart, here in your heart you have to ask a question, a very fundamental question about yourself, you close your eyes and don’t open them till I tell you, here please ask a question in your heart you can call me Mother or Shri Mataji. Mother, am I the spirit? Ask this question 3 times. If you become the spirit you become your own master, your own guru. So now take down your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen. Keep your eyes shut and ask another fundamental question about yourself, Mother am I my own master? Ask 3 times. Now take down your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen and press it hard, at this point you have to ask 6 times because this centre has got 6 petals. I must say I respect your freedom and the pure divine knowledge cannot be given to you by force so ask 6 times in your heart, Mother please give me pure divine knowledge – 6 times. Now raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. We have to open these upper centres with our self-confidence. So here you have to say with full self confidence, Mother I am my own master. Please say it 10 times – Mother, I am my own master. I’ve already told you that you are not this body, this mind, this ego, this conditioning but you are the pure spirit. So now raise your right hand on top of your heart and please say with full confidence. Mother, I am the pure spirit – say 10 times please – Mother 12 times, 12 times – Mother, I am the pure spirit. This all-pervading divine power is the ocean of compassion, ocean of knowledge and ocean of bliss and joy but above all it is the ocean of forgiveness and whatever mistakes you have committed can be easily forgiven by this power. So forgive yourself and raise your right hand in the corner of your neck and shoulder and turn your head to your right; this centre is really bad in America. Here you have to say with self-confidence 16 times. Mother, I am not guilty at all, please say this 16 times. I already told you whether you forgive or don’t forgive, you don’t do anything but if you don’t forgive then you play into wrong hands all your life. While those who have troubled you are happy but you are torturing yourself. Specially at this moment it’s very important that you forgive everyone in general because this centre is extremely constricted and if don’t forgive it won’t open and you will also miss the opportunity of your self-realization. So now take your right hand on top of your forehead across and put it down your head as far as possible. Here you have to say again from your heart not how many time, Mother, I forgive everyone in general, say it from your heart not how many time. Now you have to take your right hand on the backside of your head and push back your head as far as possible. Here you have to ask forgiveness from the divine power for your own satisfaction without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes so please say again from your heart not how many times. Oh divine power, if I have done any mistakes knowingly or unknowingly please forgive me, please say this from your heart, from your heart not how many time – Oh! Divine power please forgive me if I have done any mistakes knowingly or unknowingly. Now the last centre is very important. You have to stretch your palm fully and then put the centre of your palm on the top of the fontanel bone area, now bend your head as far as possible. Here again I cannot force self-realization on you, you have to ask for it. So you move your scalp, if you stretch your fingers outwards there will be nice pressure and you move your scalp 7 times clockwise saying Mother, please give me Self-realization. That’s all.

Now please open your eyes, put both the hands towards me like this. Put right hand towards me and put down your head and see with the left hand if there is a cool or a hot breeze like thing coming out of your fontanel bone area – the soft bone was there in your childhood just see. Now please don’t put your hand on the top of the head, away from it. Now please put both the hands towards me like this and stop thinking you can do it. You can stop your thinking. You will feel a cool or hot breeze on your hands and you feel very relax, extremely relaxed. Now those who get realization like this have to know that it is the sprouting of the seed which has to grow into a tree so you have to come to our centres, there they will give you all the necessary knowledge, all the help that is needed to make your connection perfect.
