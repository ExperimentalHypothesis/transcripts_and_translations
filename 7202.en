Public Program. Royal Albert Hall, London (UK). 24 June 1995.

I bow to all the seekers of truth.

At the very outset, we have to know that truth is what it is. It cannot be changed. It cannot be challenged and it cannot be described. Truth is beyond your mind.

You have already heard that the Divine has created a beautiful instrument within you, which exists in all human beings. Maybe because of different times, maybe some of the incarnations didn't talk about it, but most of them have talked about it. For example, Christ has said that you have to be born again. Also in the Bible, it is said, "I'll appear before you like tongues of flames". These are the centres about which you have heard.

For the last 25 years, I have been working on people with Sahaja Yoga. I found it such a tremendous thing that it is not easily believed into. Especially for people who are superficial, who just read books and now feel satisfied. All those people who are critical of everything. Those who do not have an open mind like a scientist, or some of them, who are I must say, are idiots, or maybe mad, or maybe mesmerized. But for a person who is ardently seeking, honestly seeking the absolute truth, Kundalini, about which we have heard, has to be awakened. No doubt about it. There's no compromise on that.

Today we see these flowers here. You know that they had to plant a seed in the Mother Earth and the primule had to come out of the seed and then the plant was created. In the same way, we too have a primule. There's no other way out - it has to be Kundalini awakening.

There are so many cults nowadays. You have heard of one very dangerous one. They are all money-oriented. Even the religions are money-oriented, or they are power-oriented, or maybe they are also sex-oriented. Cults are a little worse than that, I should say because they have no binding force. But all these outside religions have not given us what was promised, what was said, so we have to ask a question - what we have been doing our forefathers have been doing - all kinds of rituals, all strictness, everything - why is it we haven't got that higher state which is described?

Of course, in Indian scriptures, it is very vividly, clearly talked about but there too, people would not accept it. There was a great poet who wrote in the Marathi language, because about Kundalini was written 40,000 years back, in the 6th century and Adi Shankaracharya. But even when in the 12th century [ie. 1200s] this great poet Ganeshwara wrote about Kundalini, they just tortured his life - tortured him, tortured his sister, brothers, everyone who were full of knowledge. So he went into permanent samadhi they say - living samadhi, at the age of 23 years. But the books he has written are of such high-level spirituality. They're so joy-giving and so beautiful. But what people did to him. Is today again - they have started doing to reality, instead of saving people, telling them what is written in these books and what were the incarnations who wrote, instead of helping them to ascend, because this is a special time, which they don't realise. They are so busy with their organisation, so busy with discussions, arguments. Now recently, as you know, there has been a horrible declaration that a person whose genes are not all right, cannot be condemned. So what is the use of any religion? What's the use of having any federal laws? It's all absurd. Scientists also come to conclusions which are stupid.

Actually, genes have as I must tell you little bit scientifically - has a database, and this is in a series because there are nitrogen, phosphate and carbohydrates in a cell. And these series, if they change, then people take to perversity, to the wrong type of life. But if they're all right then a person is a normal person.

According to the scientists, they are born with it, they are inherent, they are genetic - it's not true. It's not absolutely true. They may be, but many people you know, say if your son you send to someplace in America he can get spoilt completely. His genes can be changed.

A father who is a drunkard, his son may not be a drunkard. It's so obvious. Even the chromosomes which are responsible for our body growth can be changed. If somebody's a hot-tempered person his face will change from his childhood to look like a monster. If a person is a monster and if he comes to Sahaja Yoga he looks like an angel.

What happens, actually in Sahaja Yoga the series of these changes, the series of these different things, you see, if they are changed, if they are disturbed - is corrected completely. How? The Kundalini that is within you, She nourishes, She gives the balance, She understands, She knows you, She knows all your past. She is your individual mother and She corrects. We have people here - I must tell you today - we have people who have been criminals, who have been drug addicts of the worse type, who have been drunkards, who have been also we can say, like prostitutes; adulterers; all sorts of people came to Sahaja Yoga and they are like angels. Believe me. They have become like angels. They don't have to fight anything. They have become - means it's an actualisation of the experience. It is not just talking, talk, talk, talk, talk and go and read this book and go and read that book. No. It's beyond words. Adi Shankaracharya has called as [unclear], meaning the web of words - "Oh Mother, take me out of this web of words".

Now all chaotic conditions are existing. You don't know what's happening in this world now. I mean 50 years back it was not such a bad world. But what has happened? With all this advancement, with all this growth, with all this science - well, where are we? We don't know ourselves. You say this is my body, this is my intelligence, these are my emotions, but who is the owner of this my? What is that? And that is what we have to become - that we have to become the Spirit.

It's not like having a certificate, having a born-again - it's just a false certificate. When you are born again, what you feel, you know that now, that you feel this all-pervading power of Divine Love. It is love. It is compassion which you feel. Actually, a human being is the epitome of evolution. He is so beautiful and so glorious, so loveable, but we have made him into a sex point - this Mr Freud and this Saad and all these people. They have reduced him to this level and we accept it. All this we accept. Have you got no brains to understand? Have you got no personality to understand that we just get driven to all these mad people, telling you anything? So, I have to tell you that human beings are so much ready to be in the Kingdom of God. They have to just enter in. They have to have just willingness to do it - you cannot force it on anyone. Can you force a seed to produce a tree? You cannot. It's a living process of our evolution, and now this is the last breakthrough that we have to achieve. But people are so much lost. There was one gentleman who had written a book about the last breakthrough, this, that, and when I met him I found he's completely finished. You can't give him realisation - he's lost with the words. He wrote such a book but he's not seeking the truth.

You should not accept anything which has not given you the absolute truth. With Sahaja Yoga, you know absolute. How? You put your hands out when you have got your realisation. You can feel on your fingertips your centres. Then you can feel the centres of others also. It's not only that you feel the centres of your own, but also of others. Because a new dimension has come in human awareness, which we call as a collective consciousness. It is to be actualised. It has to work out. But if you go on, say, challenging, it won't. Why not have it? You don't have to pay anything for it. It's a living process. How much do we pay to the Mother Earth?

We are so much used to payment - even in the church, even in the temple, even in the mosque, everywhere - we think we should pay. People don't understand that this is a living process of Divine Love. How much are you going to pay for love which is divine?

So, first of all, we should give up this idea that you have to pay for something. Then, secondly, you have to understand that seeking is not through ritualism - you stand on your heads, or you hit somebody, or you do all kinds of these tantrums. There's no need. You have to be respectable. When you want your freedom, you don't have to do anything, it just works out. Believe me, it works out. No credit to me either, no obligation to me. It's your own. The only thing we can say that in my presence it works out - but then, in your presence, it will work out also. That is how now, do you know, Sahaja Yoga is spreading in 65 nations. And these democracies where we are living, thinking we're very free people - you're not. Just face it - you're not, because we are possessed by money, we are possessed by materialism.

But in Russia, I was surprised, where you should say the government was horrible and they were suppressed and all that, but people have no sense of possessiveness, and they are the best, even their scientists - about 250 people came - scientists, and told me, "Mother, we'd like to hear what you have to say." I started in science. I thought better take them to science, otherwise, how will they follow me. You'd be amazed, they said "No more science. We know all that. You tell us the science of God".

So this materialism has crippled us completely. We want to possess this, possess that. They do not. They were told that you can have your flats. Government is willing to give you your houses and flats. We don't want to look after them. They said, "We don't want, we don't want any flats, we don't want any house - nothing. because we can't look after them". Can you imagine? So in a way, that curse of communism has improved them and this blessing of democracy has created demonocracy. I can see it clearly. You go to Russia. It's very different. You see people who are really, absolutely pure people. How is it in those horrible circumstances, with those sufferings that they have had, they have come out so well and how they can understand that they have to find out the truth?

About everything you can find out, whether it is absolute truth or not. The main point is, if you don't have the absolute truth, any idea you can fix-up in your head and start doing the wrong things. Like Hitler - he got the wrong idea into his head. Say that, I mean, it's funny that, the Jews must be killed. Now he started killing the Jews. Can you imagine? And he said that they are a superior race. By what measure are they superior? What, by what measure? If somebody is superior in this world, what we think of saints who are superior to us? But these people killed small children in the gas chamber and watched it. How can they be a superior race? So they get some idea into their heads that this is something, we are great, we are a superior race, we are chosen ones, we are on the path of Christ. All wrong. Just believing in yourself in the wrong way, we can go to hell directly.

First of all, know who you are. If you don't know who you are, how can we decide, how can you see the truth? Because you are not yourself. You might be Mr Freud, you might be Mr Saad, you might be somebody else. Are you yourself? This is the most important thing. I'm happy you all are here and you are seeking the truth. This is the greatest blessing of modern times, that people are - so many of them - are seeking the truth. But, you should not be misled. One gentleman was writing some very frivolous books, about - I don't know - about all kinds of nonsense, and he came to our programme, I think, and he wrote that "I was waiting and waiting for one hour, but Shri Mataji never came" - because that's the style we have. First, we have to prepare your mind a little bit, soothe it down, because you are now coming from all kinds of problems. So, just to soothe it down, we work it out for one hour. Like that. It's compulsory. But here in this place, one fellow writes against me, saying, "She never came and then She said to take out your shoes". That settled it. I mean that's the biggest crime, I've told him to do. As if I've told him to kill somebody or ... So such frivolous people, how will it work out? It's not meant for frivolous people.

I must say that so many have now got this realisation and are settled, like just like beautiful gems, in Sahaja Yoga, so many, that I'm sure there will be many more who will be coming. Because the first time when I came to England, I had to struggle with seven of them. For four years. And here you will get your realisation in no time, I know that. Because on the whole, it has from all the sides, it's grown, even in England.

So, one has to understand that you don't belong to anyone, but you belong to the Kingdom of God. And once you enter there, there are so many miracles that take place, that you'll be amazed. People have written letters after letters, "Mother, this miracle took place, that miracle took place." And I told somebody, why don't you write it down all this in a book. Within one month he tells me "This has gone over my head now. Both [unclear]. Now You select and tell me what to write". I said, "Better not. Better not write. It's absolutely not necessary." When people will see themselves and enjoy themselves, they will get the best. I mean, I don't know how to tell you, some miracles that have taken place in Sahaja Yoga. It's impossible even to think that such miracles can take place.

There was a lady in Mexico - this is the latest. She was working in U.N. in America when she met me and she became a great Sahaja yogini. She had great faith in herself - real faith. And when she went to her son, he was suffering from a disease which is quite inherent and is absolutely fatal. Most of the people in her family got it at a very later age, but this boy got it when he was studying, and she was quite worried. It's very surprising, she wrote to me in three letters, "Mother, what should I do? Should I bring this boy there or what should I do, he's so young, or should I come to you?" All kinds of things. I was very busy in these three weeks. She wrote three letters. The fourth letter came on the fourth week that, "Mother, amazingly, they took his examination and test and all were negative. He's completely cured". I didn't do anything. I didn't do. It's the Divine which looked after her because it became like a challenge. I don't know-how and the child is completely cured. It's a fact. I'm not telling you a lie and I don't want to tell you, but I'm just telling you so that you should also try to accept that you have to ascend, only this much. You have to accept that you have to ascend. That will work out tremendously.

There are so many things that happen as a result of your inner awakening. Your attention becomes enlightened. With attention, you can cure yourself and cure others also. Your attention becomes very pure. What Christ has said, "Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes". Such eyes just start shining. You have seen people. They are so much ill, I can't believe it. They wrote a letter of confessions. I never read them. I burned them. Some of them I read and I said oh - they were about to be finished and they are cured. They are all right and they are such beautiful people.

We have to think that we have no possibility of having peace within ourselves, peace in the country and the global peace. We cannot have. Why? Because we haven't felt our peace so far, so how can we have global peace? But once this happens, such friendships, such love between each other. Such pure love. I'm amazed at how these people from 65 countries love so much. I'm very proud of them, very proud, and they have specially come here - about 150 of them from all over the world - just to be present with the British Sahaja Yogis. It's really remarkable and I'm very happy that they felt this responsible. I'll tell you another thing - that the Germans in Austria felt their responsibility that they should look after the people from Israel - the Jews. So they went to Israel. Can you imagine this? Germans going there. Can they even think of that? And the first time when I went to Russia, it was the Germans who first came dashing there. "Mother, this is our place, where we have to work with you".

It's so nice to see the beauty of human nature coming out. We have so many beautiful people. I don't know how to describe them. Their beauty shows every moment and their greatness, their generosity, their sweetness. All our enemies drop out - lust and greed. All these drops. You become a beautiful person, so why not have it? But apart from that, when you are enlightened, you are like one candle which is enlightened and one candle can enlighten many people. That's how Sahaja Yoga is spreading. You will know that you can give realisations to others, you can cure people, you have the power and that is all awakened. And once you get that, you will know you are not an ordinary person. You are a special person who has got all these qualities - full of peace, joy and feeling for the whole world. We have to now think on a global level. We cannot think on a smaller level and fight.

Just now I met a great religious leader of Shias and he was telling me that people are fighting even in England among themselves. "That's the stupidity", I said. They justify it by saying that the Muslims are fighting among themselves and you justify that they are fighting among themselves. If somebody is doing wrong things, must you do that? Is there a justification for that? This went into his head and he is beginning to help us very much in solving the problem.

But there is one thing about these religions - they think they are an exclusive religion, which they are not. If you see Mohammed Sahib himself, has written about Abraham, He has written about Moses, He has written about Christ, and His Mother. Especially, He has respected His Mother much more than in the Bible. Because the Bible was written by this horrible fellow, Paul, and he must have tried to bring a bad name to Her saying She's a woman. Can you imagine? She is a Goddess and calling Her a woman. But later on, people must be the influence of the [unclear] religion, that they called Her as Madonna. They called Her. Not in the Bible. So all these things have happened to these so-called authentic books also because it was placed into wrong hands.

It doesn't mean that there was something wrong with Christ. No, not at all. But to understand Christ, you have to be born again. To understand Mohammad Sahib, you have to be born again. To understand any one of them you have to be born again because you haven't got that subtle understanding that you get as a realised soul. It's not at all difficult, but what happens, you might get your realisation here tonight. Maybe. All of you may get it. But then, you get lost. Because this Kundalini which is in the triangular bone rises, but again it goes back to cure you, to help you, to solve your mental problems. She does all these things all the time, so you have to keep Her out, you have to keep Her connected to this all-pervading power. For that, you have to meditate. You don't have to do anything else, but to give little time to yourself. If you can't give any time to yourself, what's the use? What's the use of getting your realisation? It reminds me of the parable of Christ, where He says that some seeds fell on the street and some fell on the marsh and they were sprouted and finished. So, you have to respect very much your Self-Realisation. Unless and until you respect your Self-Realisation and go ahead with it, you will not grow. But the best thing that will happen to you, that once you start meditating you'll reach a state of thoughtless awareness, where you will be in the present, which is the reality and you will grow. You will grow into beautiful things. It has happened with thousands, so why not with you people? Why it should happen with you, that you should grow into Sahaja Yoga. When I come, I see the whole hall is filled. When I go away, there are they tell us, hollow hall. "Mother, only five people who came".

So, it's like, My lecture becomes like any guru shopping, you see. "All right, let's today go and see Mother because after all, we cannot go out to the sea. It's all so clouded, so better try this one, we might enjoy". That's not the way. It's a serious thing. It's very important for you. You'll get rid of all your horrible diseases, all your troubles, everything if you really try to be growing in Sahaja Yoga. Otherwise, after some time, somebody comes, "Mother, I have got cancer". Cancer can be cured. We have cured cancer, blood cancer, I assure you. We have done that. So many things have been cured, without going to the doctor's, without going to the hospital. I don't mean that we'll cut the income of the doctors. They shouldn't be worried, because all the rich people are for them. They can take that much money as they like, they can do what they like. But for people who are in the middle path, who are seeking the truth, they don't have to pay - because they are seeking the truth, they are not seeking the money. So, they can get their relief from any kind of diseases and we can show you medically how it works. It can be brought down to the medical level. I studied medicine for the same reason because I have to talk to doctors. And I've found that medical science is very limited. It cannot go beyond a certain point. There are so many things which cannot be answered by medical science, which can be easily answered if you become a Sahaja Yogi.

I mean, you have already heard such beautiful songs. Most of them are English. Now to tell English to even say one sentence in Hindi, it was a big headache. So My father used to tell Me, "Never teach Hindi to any Englishman". It's very difficult. But today I see these Englishmen singing even Sanskrit songs so well. How their tongues are twisting, because Sanskrit is a big tongue twister. How they have picked up the song, the music, you know. I'm amazed at them. Some of them never knew how to sing, even. How they have gone up like that? It's so heartfelt joy, from them, and I'm sure all of you will get your realisation, seriously think about it and grow in it. I think there are many centres in England, especially in London, and you can go to these centres and learn from them. Only thing is, we are not very monied people, we are not very interested in money. So, all our centres are placed in very ordinary things - somewhere in the schools, somewhere like that. It doesn't matter.

Those who are seekers, whether they are rich or poor, whether they are middle-class - everybody is just the same in the eye of God. So, you have to humbly go and develop yourself. You can save the world. England is the heart of the universe. You don't know that. It circulates everywhere. Any small thing happens in England circulates, but the media is so horrible that sometimes I think they are suffering from angina or what. This media can be corrected once they know the reality and work it out. So, your ascent is very important to Me, and I've gone up and down fully from the north to south, east to west and all directions in England because it's very important. People, somehow or other, are in circulation with the British. So British have a special responsibility, that they should not publish something nonsensical without verifying it; nor they should do something nonsensical here, because everything, more than America, is accepted from England. Very surprising. So, the responsibility of English is much more than anybody else, I feel, but I don't know how many are going to see this responsibility.

Now, we have many immigrants also - from India, because English was there for 300 years. So, automatically, there are immigrants. But they are so bound by pounds that they are just collecting pounds. They don't remember from where they come, what is their tradition, what they have to seek, nothing. So you'll find very few Indians, because they are uprooted people, and they are here. They have forgotten their tradition. But that doesn't mean that Sahaja Yoga is something partial. It is not. It's open to all of you. All of you are very much respected and wanted to come to Sahaja Yoga. Sahaja Yogis are trying their level best to spread Sahaja Yoga. There's no conversion. There's no branding. Nothing. But what happens is that you become a spiritual personality, so easily, without going into any problem. So easy, isn't it? Such remarkable discoveries there, which can change the whole world. So I put more responsibility on the English to do it more, accept it more. Not only to My lecture but to come up with something that is substantial, for your country and for the whole world.

Thank you very much.

Just a minute, where are you going? Just a minute. Now you've come to take your realisation, not to listen to my lecture only, did you? Please.

I have already told you that you are beautiful people - very beautiful, but you must have respect for yourself. You have to love yourself and understand that you have to get your realisation. You have to - it's very important. The most important thing for you is not to get a lottery but to get your Self-Realisation.

[Talking to a Sahaja Yogi about the microphone] This is like some Sahaja Yogis who go on falling down.

All right. Now again I have to request you to take out your shoes. I hope you don't mind. So that you are in contact with the Mother Earth. Those who are sitting on the chair, please take out your shoes.

Now, as you know there are two powers within us. Please keep both your feet apart from each other.

Come forward.

Just have, as I said, respect for yourself. You should not suffer from any inferiority complex at all. So, before we start, I have to tell you that there are three conditions which are very simple, logically.

The first one is that you should not feel guilty at all about anything. As in the Catholic religion, you have to confess, you don't have to confess anything to me. I know you very well. So, now, you should have a very pleasant attitude towards yourself - of not anger or of guilt. If you feel guilty then this centre here on the left-hand side [left side of the neck] gets into trouble and you get spondylitis, you might get angina, you might get lethargic organs. But guilt is a myth because when you committed a mistake you should have faced it and finished with it. You cannot carry it all your life.

I know one gentleman who once used spoon and fork in a different way and all the time he used to tell me, "I felt very guilty in England because I didn't know how to use spoon and fork". Can you imagine?

All this nonsensical thing which are of no importance. Anything you have done, at this moment here is forgiven because this Divine Power is the ocean of forgiveness. It's forgiven, so please forgive yourself and please don't feel guilty. This centre [left side of the neck], if this centre is out of order, how will the poor Kundalini push through.

Now, the second important thing is that you have to forgive everyone. Not to think about whom you have to forgive. Now some people say, "It's very difficult, Mother. It's too much for us". What is it? Whether you forgive or you don't forgive, what do you do? Nothing. But if you forgive, at least you don't play into wrong hands. All your life you have tortured yourself by not forgiving, so now, at his moment, you must forgive. Forgive from your heart, everyone in general, not to think even about them.

Third one again, I have to tell you that you have to take out your shoes. Some people have objection for this also, that Mother asks us to take out our shoes. I didn't say to take out your crown, I said to take out your shoes. That's nothing so great.

So, be in a very pleasant mood to have this ascent into the Kingdom of God. You have never felt this all-pervading power of Divine Love, which is the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost, as they say - and even in the scriptures written by Adi Shankaracharya himself. [Words in Sanskrit.] He calls it [words in Sanskrit] the waves of beauty. But he describes them ... [Words in Sanskrit.] But it's not very cool, also. It is very nourishing and extremely soothing feeling that you get when you get a connection. So, for that, you have to have these three conditions I've told you.

Now, both the feet have to be apart from each other, because these are two powers - left and right - and the left and right powers, because they are two powers, keep your feet separately. So your left-hand side problems and your right side problems can be taken away by the Mother Earth. That's all you have to do - nothing more.

Now, please put both your hands like this [palms upwards] towards Me. Now, these are the fingers and here the sixth and the seventh point [Mother points to each finger and then the base and centre of palm] which are our seven centres on the left-hand side and in the same way we have on the right-hand side. Left-hand side left, we can say, the left side looks after our emotional side, and the right side our mental activity and our physical activity.

You put your both the hands like this [palms upwards towards Mother].

Now, you have to close your eyes and please don't open them till I tell you. But, before that, I will show you - before that I will show you - how you are to place your right hand, which is for action, and the left hand like this [palm upwards] towards Me. With this right hand, you have to put them in different centres, nourishing your own centres. Maybe many must be already feeling the cool breeze in the hand, many must be, but still, you do it, it will be better.

So now, we'll show you.

First, you have to put your right hand on the heart. In the heart, in the heart, resides the Spirit. If you become the Spirit, you become your own master, your own guide, because you get the light of the Spirit and you know what it is.

Then you put your right hand on the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side. This is the centre of your mastery. This you will learn much more when you come to the centres. They will explain to you much better.

Now, take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side. Now, this is the centre which is surprisingly is for pure divine knowledge.

Now, you take your hand upward onto the left-hand side of your abdomen, on the upper part.

Now, take this right hand on your heart.

Now you put your right hand in the corner of your head, neck and your shoulder. Now turn your head to your right. This is the centre I have already told you when it goes into jeopardy, you get diseases. So, this is the centre, when you feel guilty it goes into trouble.

Now, take your right hand on top of your forehead across and put down your head as far as possible. This is the centre for forgiving others, without thinking about them, in general.

Now, take the right hand on the backside of your head and push back your head as far as possible. This is the centre where you have to ask forgiveness from the Divine Power for your own satisfaction.

Now, stretch your hand, palm, fully. Stretch your palm fully and put the centre of your palm on top of the fontanelle bone area, which was a very soft bone. Don't worry about your hairdresser. Please put the hand nicely pressing, so you push back your fingers, so there's a good pressure on your fontanelle bone area. Now, this you have to move, slowly seven times clockwise. Bend your head, please. You can take out your spectacles if you like and bend your head and move your hand slowly, clockwise seven times.

That's all.

Now you have to close your eyes. Please close your eyes.

Now, put your right hand on top of your heart, left hand towards me and both the feet apart from each other. Now, here you have to ask me a very fundamental question about yourself. You have to ask me three times in your heart. You can call me Mother, you can call me Shri Mataji. "Mother, am I the Spirit?" Ask this question three times, in your heart, not loudly.

Now, I've told you that if you become the Spirit, you become your own master, so please take your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side. Here you have to ask another fundamental question, three times, "Mother, am I, my own master?". I have to tell you that I cannot force Self-Realisation on you. You have to ask for it.

So now we take our right hand in the lower portion of our abdomen and here you have to ask for pure, divine knowledge. So ask six times because this centre has got six petals, "Mother, please give me pure, divine knowledge". Humbly you must ask, not demanding, but humbly.

Now, raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side. As soon as you asked for the pure, divine knowledge, the Kundalini has started rising and we have to open these centres by our self-confidence. Here you have to say with full self-confidence 10 times, "Mother, I am my own master". Say it 10 times, please. Which is a fact, which you will be, but you have to show your readiness.

I've already told you that you have to become the Spirit because you are not this body, this mind, these emotions, this intelligence, these conditionings or this ego, but you are a pure Spirit. So raise your right hand on top of your heart now and say 12 times with full confidence, "Mother, I am the pure Spirit".

This all-pervading power is the ocean of knowledge, is the ocean of compassion and love, is the ocean of bliss, but above all, it is the ocean of forgiveness, so please forgive yourself. Whatever you have done in the past can be easily dissolved by the power of this ocean of forgiveness. So please raise your hand on the left-hand side of your shoulder, on the corner of your neck and the shoulder, and turn your head to your right. Here you have to forgive yourself and so you have to say, "Mother, I am not guilty at all", 16 times. "Mother, I am not guilty at all", 16 times. With self-confidence, you have to say that. Please say it. I feel it again and again whenever we have programmes here, that this centre is very badly affected in people, that they feel guilty.

I've already told you that whether you forgive or you don't forgive, you don't do anything; but by not forgiving you play into wrong hands. So, what's the use of torturing your life with this myth? So now please raise your right hand on top of your head and put down your head. Not head on top, but we can say, on top of your forehead. On top of your forehead. And now put down your head. Here you have to say from your heart, not how many times, "I forgive everyone, in general". Say it from your heart, not how many times. You'll feel much lighter. Say it from your heart, please.

Now for your own satisfaction, you have to ask forgiveness from the Divine Power - not feeling guilty, not counting your mistakes. So now please take your right hand on the backside of your head and push back your head as far as possible and here you have to say, "O Divine Power, if I've done anything wrong knowingly or unknowingly, please forgive me". Now, this also you have to say from your heart, not counting how many times, "O Divine Power, if I've done anything wrong knowingly or unknowingly, please forgive me".

Now the last centre is very important. You have to stretch your palm fully and put the centre of your palm on top of the fontanelle bone area. Now please understand that there has to be pressure on this fontanelle bone area, which was a soft bone in your childhood. Now push back your fingers so that there is a nice pressure on this area and now put down your head. Here again, I have to say, I cannot force Self-Realisation on you. You have to ask for it. So now please put down your head and move your scalp - not your hands so much as the scalp - seven times saying, "Mother, please give me Self-Realisation".

[Mother blows down the microphone seven times.]

Now please take down your hands, slowly and open your eyes, very slowly. You can wear your spectacles. Put both the hands towards me a little higher. Little higher. Now please put the right hand towards me like this [raised palm upwards towards Mother] and with the left hand you can see if there is a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your head [left-hand palm above the head]. Now don't doubt because there's no air-conditioning here in your head. So just see if there's a cool - bend your head - or a hot breeze [unclear] is coming. Some people get it very far, some people get it nearby, but don't touch your head. Keep away from it. Now, please put the left hand towards me [raised palm upwards]. Now, put down your head again and see with the right hand if there are cool or hot breeze-like vibrations are coming out of your own fontanelle bone area. Now it is hot because either you have not forgiven yourself or you have not forgiven others, so please do it now. Immediately it will become cooler. It's done.

Now again, with the right hand again. See for yourself. You can move your hand.

Now please put both your hands towards the sky and push back your head. Here you have to ask another question. Anyone of these three questions, you have to ask one question three times in your heart. Please ask, "Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?". Second, "Mother, is this the all-pervading power of Divine Love?", which is [unclear]. Or, "Mother, is this the Paramachaitanya?". Ask anyone of these questions three times.

Now, please bring down your hands. Again, put both the hands towards Me. [Raised hands towards Mother, palms upwards.] Can you watch Me without thinking? Without thinking can you watch, because your attention reaches beyond your mind into thoughtless awareness. Some are feeling here, they should move it upward like that. Some are feeling from down below. [Mother strokes from the wrist upwards on the back of each hand.]

Now, all those who have felt the cool or hot breeze on their fontanelle, through their fontanelle bone area or on their fingers, fingertips or the palm, please raise both your hands.

Oh my, all of you have got it. So great. May God bless you all. May God bless England.
