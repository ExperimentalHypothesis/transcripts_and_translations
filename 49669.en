Talk to new people, Tivoli, Italy, 1983-09-10

We go to the essence of things to the roots.

Now if there is a disease on the knees, you cannot cross the knee They have to go to the roots to find out how the disease is showing. So we have to go to the roots now because we have to understand that we are much more subtler than what we know about ourselves. So we go to the subtler side of ...Not only we are bothered about the outside things that we see but we have to know about the inside of us. What causes all the outcome. So when we are...as the person who comes with the for us to give us Salvation we go to the essence to find out to who He is. It is said in the Bible that he is the Alpha and the Omega, means He is the first and the last.But to explain it there is nothing in the Bible. But we have other books, other scriptures UNCLEAR where He is described, and he is called as Maha Vishnu in one of the books and the essence of Him is innocence. All to emit innocence. But before he was born.. UNCLEAR .So  Primordial mother first to give image of Christ which was to come on this earth and this is called as Shri Ganesha in the scriptures. There is a very interesting story as to how Shri Ganesha was created by the Primordial mother. So that day is the birthday of that essence, that was created just much before the UNCLEAR and that is how it is a very auspicious day for us to be here present on a  day when the essence of Christ was created.In our Chakras you have those Kundalini UNCLEAR , the first chakra which is called as the Mooladhar chakra is residing here. And then he manifests later on as the child of Mother Mary conceptual And that also can be explained very well how he was conceived. For this you have to listen to..you have Shri Ganesh. Because now you are exposed to the subtler knowledge of your being. That is why the first centre innocence is the support of the Kundalini that is called as Mooladhara. For if the Kundalini is the abode of the triangular bone abode of the Kundalini then this chakra is the one that is the support. And there resides the cells within us of wisdom.

That is how Self-realization comes to us. I must say Italians are very wise people. Normaly they don't take to ridiculous things. And even if they do not for a long time. So it is very important to understand the source of all this. So if we behave in an unwise manner in life then we must know that this centre is not alright. And this centre is the centre it represents UNCLEAR innocence of a person is, a person has to lead a life of purity and chastity. When the Kundalini rises its purity is established and you will be amazed that your eyes start becoming innocent. Gradually you develop an innocent personality and you look like a UNCLEAR. That's what Christ has said that you have to be like small children if you have to enter into the kingdom of God. So some people think they are guilty, that we have done this wrong and that wrong but the wisdom is that you should understand that you are not dealing with the past but you are dealing with the present. So at present when the Kundalini is awakened you are innocent and then you will find this innocence and open the heart and joy will start pouring in your heart. Because we have never known joy we have been doing all kinds of wrong things. As soon as we start feeling the joy then you just give up everything else because it opens up inside. So today is also the day to celebrate the source of joy that is  Shri Ganesha that is inside. So this centre must be kept clean and we must respect ourselves. In these modern times people have funny ideas about religion. We do all unnatural things UNCLEAR.So abandonment or enslavement is not we want to achieve.You see it is important to understand  that this source of innocence is always there and it can always be awakened.And once it is awakened it manifests it's qualities. Now  when I was in England first, when I came about ten years back, I have been telling them about a chaste married life. They said, You are Victorian,old fashioned.

So I said alright, once you get your Realisation'I don't have to tell you, you yourself will straighten out. But I predicted that you will get terrible diseases which will reflect UNCLEAR. Only the UNCLEAR. And now you see America there is outbreak of disease called the Aids and disease in England and now people are saying  Mother what you said is true and no one can cure. For your information even we can cure diseases. And this can be done automatically.  (Child crying)

Mother says to take her out).

You must all understand that it is very important to have this centre extremely UNCLEAR. If this centre is weak, what happens,  the Kundalini comes up, again it sucks down. And then we have to raise it again and again and times and again and again because it falls down. So it is very important to understand how this centre has to be clean. Now those people who have come for the first time must know that Yoga also means apart from union with the divine UNCLEAR means expertise,

how to be an expert and with divine power that is within you. So to understand it you have to  learn two ways of, now at this stage Shri Ganesha he is within you. Now He is connected with you and if you want you can address Him and awaken Him. And these things when we can say in the suplex we call it a mantra inside which you awaken or call the deity within you. But one cannot give a general mantra to someone like we say this mantra is good or that mantra, it is all absurd. It is depending on where is the problem and which they see is in problem. Though there are seven chakras and you have to know only seven mantras UNCLEAR. Because with God you have to have a protocol. You cannot say alright Ganesh, you get alright. You cannot talk like that.You have to address him with an UNCLEAR  and that makes you absolutely perfect invitation for Him to be awakened. The bija mantra the seed mantra is UNCLEAR but when you have to use the mantra you have to use the suplex which all the Sahajayogies know here and they will teach you how to use because protocol is the same. But the name of the deity can be taken only one sentence And you will be surprised that when you use them then the Kundalini rises one by one. You can see it rising. Now it is a fantastic World you have entered into. And it is UNCLEAR you will be quite surprised UNCLEAR. But keep your mind open. Now there are about seventy percent people who are realised souls UNCLEAR

and they all know how to, they are Sahajayogies they depth. And you can see from their faces how their faces changes from UNCLEAR like flowers. And they are not aggressive and very kind and nice people and very great friends of each other. We have people here from different countries they also. Some people have not yet. They will arrive by 1'0.clock.So you will find your brothers and sisters all over the world. You must know that seekers are of special category. They are different type of people but you don't know why they are different. When they get Realisation' they will understand that they are people who are thinking of higher status, higher spiritual status, and this category is specifically there because if you are not a seeker I cannot give you Realisation. And even if you try coming to one or two sessions it will be a headache for me. You should not try to get after them because they are not seeking, they are thinking of money,this and that.So the best is for you to find out who are seekers like you and talk to them about Sahajayoga.And you can also learn how to give Realisation to others. Today you might learn that. It is so simple and it so fast, learning is very fast. Faster than any other UNCLEAR.So now if you have any questions you ask me otherwise we are going to have our lunch and then  we can have our, you are going to have our, but I don't know the newcomers have taken or not. Today we are going to do a sort of a worship to Shri Ganesha. If you want to join you can join but normally we don't allow new comers to join. If you are interested you can join. So first is to establish Shri Ganesha then in the new place of the ashram we would like to establish Him first of all so that He is awakened here and He is the source of wisdom and joy.

Alright you can ask questions.

Question: You are able to see in one of us Kundalini is awakened.

Shri Mataji: All of you are. You can see what is coming out. It is the Kundalini. It is the Kundalini on top of your head. What else. Without awakening the Kundalini you don't get the cool breeze. Not only it is awakened but it is also true. Now you have become a saint. It is so quick that you can't believe how can you have become saints like that overnight. But how a flower becomes. It is true. An egg suddenly you see when it is broken how it comes out like a bird.

Question: Why does she feel colder on one side and than the other side?

Shri Mataji: When you feel hot here you put the left hand like this you see so UNCLEAR. When you feel the hot here you put your left like this. You have to get established that is the point. That's why You must learn to meditate in the morning and all those things because these are all established people who have come. You have to do yourself. Alright. Are you feeling hot less or somewhat, hot. Put down the stool, press hard. For that you all should put left to the right. Put your hand left like that. Left raise it like that and put it to the right so that there is a balance.Left over means.. again. Do seven times. You bring it like this and throw it away on the side,like that. Now you can raise the Kundalini. Put your left hand now like this. One, again, second time two, third time one two three. You put your right hand towards me and left hand towards mother earth.Then you put the left hand towards me and right hand on the mother earth. UNCLEAR.Better?How are you feeling?

Sahajayogi: He feels nothing special and he also.UNCLEAR

Shri Mataji: Alright.You can come this side.

Sahajayogi: He had Realisation'.He not meditate regularly.

Shri Mataji: For some time you must meditate. You got established otherwise in the beginning like a seed. You sprout it and later if you neglect it it can die. You have to look after it till it becomes substantially strong. Are you all with out thought or thought in your mind? Those who are hot, come here.

(Shri Mataji giving treatment to the people.)Come here. Put light behind, I have got here.

Are you keeping good health?

Sahajayogi: A little bit tired and exhausted.

Shri Mataji: Otherwise health is alright?

Sahajayogi: He is saying yes. May be little bit of kidney, she had last year kidney colitis she had last year and small cystis on both but very light not.
