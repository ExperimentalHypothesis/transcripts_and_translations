Talk to Sahaja Yogis
Rahuri (India)
Talk Language: Marathi | Translation (Marathi to English) - Draft

Just now these western people have told us about their own experiences or you can say about their deliberation.  Due to lack of time they couldn’t tell you everything, but even then one thing should be noted, that, in their lectures they have talked about the greatness of our India. Not only that but, they have put real emphasis on the boundaries (Maryada), the faith (Shradha) and the Dharma which we have in our country, which is something so important and so special, they have lost all these things.  I have been to the foreign countries many times,  but I had no idea that the conditions there were so terrible and so serious.

When my husband  was elected, I had to go to London, and had to live there. After that I started the work of Sahaja Yoga there, actually these people themselves had made a start, because they somehow found out  that Mataji has come.  So when I came in contact with the society there , I was surprised that on the basis of science, how these people have gone so far  away from the truth.  ‘Science’ means to search for the truth.  Science means discovering the real truth, science means recognizing the truth out of whatever it is out there.. But we have to try and understand, why the science of these people, whatever it is, has gone so far away from the truth.

Human being, is not complete as he is, you have not reached that state of completeness.  Like there is this machine, if it is not connected with the mains then it is absolutely useless, or it is completely meaningless.  It is same with human beings.  Until human beings have recognized the spirit, or  he has established his connection with God, or the eyes of the soul are opened ,until then he is incomplete.  So how is he going to realize the truth? You can see that man is incomplete just by looking at his actions.  If you give him freedom, then he behaves like a fool,  if you take his freedom away, then he becomes repressed, if you tied him up then he become useless, if you let him loose , he will roam around aimlessly. He has no idea about himself, has no discretion, not only that, but he has no self-respect, no dignity.

For small small things he will sell himself, even knowingly, he will be submissive before unfavorable people, sometimes in the name of power, sometimes in the name of money, sometimes for some immoral things.  So we should know that there is something missing in human beings, that means he has not recognized himself, he has not found out about his own wealth.   In India, in ancient times, the attention of man was not on materialism, there is a very good reason for that and is our good fortune, which, the climate of our country is such that we could live in forest, we can live on trees,  don't have to wear too many clothes, don’t need to eat too much, the air is so beautiful in our country, that it does not require so much from elsewhere.

Now you will be surprised that in London,if you have to go out then you need to spend fifteen minutes just to get ready, you have to put on a coat and this and that, etcetera etcetera. If there is not heating in the house then you can not sit there, you will die.  You can’t go out straight after having a bath there, many Indian people in London have lung cancer, and they have come to the conclusion now that because of Indian people have a habit of going out straight after having their bath, that is why they get lung cancer.

When I went to London for the first time, I felt that  there is some kind of curse or something from God there!  So cold and such wind and so much of weird rain, and such mud. They told me that, people even play football while holding umbrellas here.  That is how bad it is, means everything is like complete madness.  The atmosphere there is very crazy. So it is not surprising that  people have gone mad there.  But your land is so lush, this is very special land that God has created, those people who return from  foreign countries, they realize how special this land is, and how unique it is.  Because of all the troubles in the outside world, and life is so difficult for every moment , so naturally man will look for something in outside world, to know how to overcome all this , in what way? everything is a challenge,  whatever path they have to take in life is a challenge.

Everyone has to face challenges all the time, and because of that they have developed an ego orientation, means they developed an ego.  If father says something then it becomes a challenge, if mother says something, that also becomes a challenge, because they have to spend their whole life facing challenges, very crazy challenges, if you say that,  out of you people who will blacken his face, then even big professors will be ready, there is a craze about accepting  challenges.

We are blessed with this wisdom, this discretion because of this land.  Perhaps Indians do not know this fact that, normally an Indian person does not do foolish things, ‘normally’, but because of the blessings of these people and because of they have ruled us for so long,  when they see a Sahib (a white person), they think he must be something very special.  In India, since the ancient times, many Sages and Munis has found out that how everything in the Universe is run and who it is run by.  If you say that  the earth has the gravity, so  whatever a scientist has seen with his clumsy eyes, he has told us, they don’t have subtle eyes, so they can only tell us  that there is gravity, but why is it  there, or how has it come in to the existence? nobody can explain that.  They can explain that there are pulsations in sulfur dioxide, in sulfur and oxygen atoms, they can only explain that it happens, but they can not explain why it happens, how it happens, and who makes it happen.

This is the limit of science, you can not go beyond that limit, to be able to cross this boundary you have to be on another level.  That means, I will give you an example, that without  the right instrument,  we can not look in to histology, at the cells , in detail.  In the same way, there is this big instrument within us, which is our Spirit, which many Rishis and Sages has told us about,  which the wise (intellectuals) people do not believe in.  We have become a bit too wise nowadays, so we do not believe in anything, that what is this (Spirit) Atma and all that? So we should at least try to find out if there is something within us.  So many people have been talking about it, which can’t be all false.  When it comes to Religion we do not have this scientific nature (tendency) in us.  We come to such conclusions,that those people were somehow different, and we do not have any connection with them, they were telling something, their discoveries are something different, which is nothing to do with us, they were not human etcetera,etcetera, and today's Indian society is making progress, upon such conclusions.  I can not say if it is a progress or what, but after seeing the decline of such progress, I can tell you that, this kind of progress should be stopped while there is still time, so how could we stop it? It can only happen through proper meditation.

It can not be done by half baked people, not only that but I am surprised to see, such young people like you, can not even concentrate your attention even for a short time, I have been watching for quite a while, it is very surprising,  when we were at your age, Gandhiji had fought here, and no one would even blink an eye, with such concentration we use to listening to the lectures of these people.   When there is such an important point has been raised,  there should be real concentration.   But even if someone has entered from another side , then somebody has to look at him, like we have never seen another person before. Do we want to waste our attention for looking here and there all our life, or sometime we want to look within ourselves also?  We should look at ourselves also , that time also has to come , to look at  ourselves, and now that time has come, that we have to know our self, we have to look at our self, then only you can be complete.  Otherwise , if you start any political thing or any form of economic thing, it will all fail and go under, in an incomplete state everything you plan will fail, and whatever you will plan will turn out to be wrong,

‘Sankalp vikalp karoti’, it has been said in the scriptures.  Whether there is a ‘Spirit’ (Atma) or not? Is a big question before people now, like as if they are going to answer this question by their intellect!   We know,that this intellect also has its limit, don’t we?  How can we understand the things, with our limited minds, which are beyond our limits?  Now, whatever you have understood about science, which Rustum has just told us, which  has come to you spontaneously from your unconscious, not by you making any effort.   Einstein has said so clearly that I was comfortably lying in my garden, and blowing soap bubbles, because I was so bored in the laboratory, and from somewhere unknown, from somewhere unconscious, the whole theory relativity started dancing in front of me.

What a great truth he has told you!   from that  we should realize, what this unconscious is. What this Omnipresent power is, which he called the ‘Universal Unconscious, which reaches there, which our Saints and Sages have told us about, that the power of God is omnipresent.  If that omnipresent power is doing everything, and we are just going around here and there, I will give you an example:  Once some people from a village got on an aeroplane for the first time, they had  been told not to bring too much luggage, it will be too heavy, so they put their luggage on their heads.  Like that, we also do such things.

To know the science of this power, is the real knowledge, the power, which is doing all the work and after that this science will also have a meaning.  To give you an example: Take any science, let’s say chemistry, yesterday I was talking to the chemistry professor, so I said to him that, if you look at the  periodic laws in chemistry, you will see that there is some kind of program behind it, and everything is so organized.  They all have  different valences, each one of them have different valences, and they don’t change, and whichever position they are in, it still works.  If there is nobody organizing it,  then how is it possible? it is so well arranged.  We don’t even feel, that we are sitting on this huge planet earth,  which is rotating.  spinning  earth , and that with such a speed, with keeping exact distance, while all the planets and stars goring around.  After witnessing all these miraculous things, the people who have made lot of progress and reached very high level in science, even they have started saying that, they do not understand anything beyond this, they can not find an answer to this, and we can not explain why all this happens.

If you ask a scientist or doctor that if something enters our body (which should not be there), then we throw it out, but when a fetus is there, when a child is there in a mothers womb, then it is nurtured, and not only that but it comes out at the right time, so who does all this?  Now we have these two nervous systems,  autonomous and central nervous system, they have two chemicals , which are called acetylcholine and adrenaline. The behavior of these chemicals is different in different places, means they behave in a different way in the throat, or here it will be different, in English it is called augmentation relaxation.  It is all different, but why is it like that?  The reaction of one chemical should be same everywhere!  But if you ask them that who makes this happen, they will say we can not explain it, they are very honest about it, they say that the mode of action we can not explain.  But even though they are honest, they are not enlightened, they have no understanding about it.  Therefore all this knowledge is without any understanding.

First of all there is a need for understanding,  without understanding the knowledge does not have any meaning.  And understanding comes from the Atma (the Spirit), and we need to know the Spirit. Now how to know the Spirit? Has God made any arrangement for that in us?  If you can see all the planning of God so beautifully in a periodic law and all the elements are divided so beautifully, and it is all done so beautifully. Every chemical reaction God has managed so beautifully.   God has made the rules to such an extent that, a rose bush will only bear roses and a mango tree will only bear mangoes,  then he must have thought something for you people also.  Not only that but God has placed you above all these things, and you can control all those things, and today you can look Gods’ principle as science, at a very superficial  level, that, you are human beings, and human beings are the most highest level of God’s creation.

But have to admit one thing ,that the man is capable of being stupid, which no one else has, no other animals know how to be stupid.  Only man can be stupid and can become really foolish.  This is a specialty of a man.  Because of this freedom, there is this big problem!  But you have to also accept this freedom, without  the freedom, how could you be given the kingdom?  That is why you have been given this freedom, along with the wisdom.  And you have to really rise high, and a real ascent comes from  the ascent of your spirit.  So whatever way the man has been created and whatever he has inside him is all like this.

Now there are many things could be said about it, but I will tell you briefly.  First of all, the thing which I call Atma (Spirit) , or you can say that there is the image of God within us, which is in our heart.    In Gita it is called Kshetragnya (knower of the field), or Sakhsi Swarupa, which we do not recognize, means there is no place for it in our central nervous system.  It is not in our consciousness.  He is watching us, we know it is there but we do not know how to use it.  Such a spirit is in our heart, and even when the spirit is there in our heart, we can not recognize it, and if it is God’s desire that we should know him then he must have made some arrangement within us.  And that arrangement is such , that  many Sadhus and Saints, also many highly evolved souls has written about it, and today there is lot of research going on about this in western countries.  People have come to conclusion that, a person can’t transcend unless the Kundalini is awakened.  Even when they accept this,  their foolishness becomes an obstacle in  awakening of  the Kundalini.

God has placed all these instruments within you, and the one which is to sprout, that is the Kundalini Shakti, which we can not see, which is sitting within us.  So if you come to our program, we could show you its pulsation.  There are at least fifty percent people are sitting here, who has witnessed the awaking of the Kundalini with their own eyes, means the pulsation of the Kundalini happens in the triangular bone within us, you can see it with you eyes, you can see it pulsating.  And while pulsating it rises through the six centers, now, I will tell you what  these six centres are, and below is the seventh centre.

This is just like sprouting of the seed within us, so, when the seed is sprouting, do we  pull it out , or we do some yoga for that, or do we have to read some books to find out about it?  it happens naturally and and spontaneously like a living process,  When you plant  this seed , you only have to water it, it will happen aromatically, if, like a good farmer would take care of it, then it will happen aromatically.  It has all been organized in advanced, it is built in, all the arrangements are there already, it sprouts automatically.   Just like that, this is a living process and process of evolution.   This is the last action of the evolution, this is going to happen automatically, for that if you go on making some efforts, or you stand on your heads, or become  sanyasis, and give up this and give up that, nothing is going to happen. Whatever is within you is just there, and it happens automatically, only thing is  that you need someone who knows about it,  the one who will lovingly nourish it and will help the sprout to grow.  We need to understand that the chakra below the sprout, is below the seed,  and this is the chakra of Shri Ganesh.

We do not know what Ganesha is, we all say that, we go to Ganapati, my father used to go, his father used to go, so we also go to Ganapati.  But what is Ganesh, and what is his chakra  about, and what do we learn from it, what work has he done for it?  So Ganesh is the sign of ‘purity’, a symbol of ‘purity’, means before God had  created the whole universe,  before creating anything else, before bringing us in to an existence, before the time of immemorial, God placed Shri Ganesha here first, that is the purity. Purity has been given the most important place.  And the greatness of our Maharashtra is that,  the Mother earth has brought out all the eight Shri Ganeshas here.  They were raised here out of the ground, or they have appeared here, or they were found here, whatever it is, because of all these eight Ganapatis have taken place here in Maharashtra, the people of Maharashtra has the special responsibility that they have to absolutely maintain the purity.

Maharashtra is a special state, and Rahuri is the heart of it.  And the farmers from there who come to study here at the university, they will all take this wealth (knowledge) back to Maharashtra, and is your greatest responsibility to take this wealth of purity to every village and every city.  So first thing is to establish the purity, and the symbol of purity which is Shri Ganesh, he is always in a form of a child. The story we have that, the Mother Kundalini, who is sitting above, is in the form of Shri Gauri, she is still a virgin, means after marriage she is still a virgin, and she is waiting for her husband.  So the Gauri is sitting there and Ganesha is protecting her, so that she is not troubled by anything.

Now there are different types of Kundalini awakenings, the main reason for that is, as you all know that there are so many disgusting gurus, and they are openly teaching all the dirty things, and these poor foreigners come here to learn about it, and they do not understand anything, they are so foolish, such idiots,that , they think that they even need a guru to learn these dirty things.   And if these gurus go to the foreign countries, and start teaching, they are all people with degrees, so I don’t understand that why they make these people as their gurus, but then I thought that these people think that there discretion itself is consuming them. Then they start thinking that what have we done, and that, something has gone very wrong here, we are behaving like fools, and we need someone to witness it all, and that is why we have took to this guru.  But tomorrow when this guru goes to hell, then there is no doubt that he is going to take these people with him.

The Kundalini is your ‘Mother’, but because of this stupidity and abuse and mistreating of the Kundalini, that there are so many different types of Kundalini methods has started.  Now I have heard that there is gentleman in Delhi, who has started a branch of Kundalini, this man has no idea what  auspiciousness is, and if this person starts the place of Kundalini, to do all dirty things, then not only that he will be destroyed,  but it is possible that our country will also be destroyed. Because of such activities of these people there is no rain, good fortune disappears,  the Lakshmi principle also gets destroyed,  and many disasters occur.  Whoever takes to this kind of path, they face such horrible kinds of  problems, that they do not understand what have we done to make all this happen to us. How dirty must be the people who makes such dirty accusations against their own mother, and those who accept such people as their guru, you should know that they are even more stupid and they do not have any common sense.

So the Kundalini is sitting below, in the triangular bone, and she pierces through these 1, 2, 3, 4,5,6, chakras, that means there is no relation between this piercing and and sex.  Only, Shri Ganesha is sitting there and protecting his Mother.  You all have your own individual mother, everyone has a different mother, the way you would have nurtured her and the way you have kept your purity, whatever good fortune you might have achieved in past lives, whatever good or bad things you might have done, and whatever you have done in this life, all that is recorded like a tape.  When the Kundalini awakens, you feel the proof of it on your hands.  We can show you the rising of the Kundalini, many people have seen it, so there is no need to doubt it, if you are a real scientist with open minds, then come and see whatever hypothesis there is, and prove it to yourself.

When this Kundalini rises, it pierces through these six centers and after crossing the six centers, when it reaches here at the top, which is called the Bramharandra, when it reaches here, at the top of the head, this is the place of Shiva, when it gets enlightened, Shiva, within our heart, means the principle of the Spirit within our heart gets enlightened.  As soon as it gets awakened, the power of the spirit, which is called Anahad naad, means the vibrations, starts to flow through your hands.

This is a spontaneous yoga, that means it is born with you, each one of you has a right to achieve this yoga, Otherwise, it will be like, some computer which is not connected to the mains, will be wasted away, just like that our life will be wasted.  It has to be connected with mains, and after that whatever you want to know, should know as an absolute.  So you will be surprised that, without knowing all this, whatever you learn in science,is all false knowledge (avidya).  I will tell you simple thing about planning, now for example if I have planned that we have to go to such and such place, but what  will happen, that when we go there, this person will not be there, and things will go wrong, it won’t workout.  But after getting your self realization through Sahaja Yoga, if you put your hands out and ask a question whether you should go or not,if the person is there or not, then immediately you will feel the vibrations,  but if you just give him bandhans, he will just meet you on the street, like you have telephoned him.

There are many such examples , I will give you really simple example about our Gavin, after coming to Sahaja Yoga, he was still doubting, because he is a bit too intellectual, so becomes stupid, and that is why he was not able to understand what I was saying.  One day he said to me that, I have not received a letter from my father for a long time, so could you please check, his father was living in Scotland.  So I told him to check his vibrations, after checking the vibrations , he said, he is getting burning here, that is the place of the father, and this one is the Vishuddhi chakra, so I told him to call his father, and check, if he has trouble with his throat or has got bronchitis or something!  So when he called, his mother told him that, his father has been in bed for a week or so, and suffering from bronchitis, so he immediately believed what Mataji has said.  Now, he himself  tells everyone. Now he even knows what is happening to you, he could instantly tell you.  But people don’t have brains in such things.

The other day, what happened was, that there were three girls, Sahaja Yoginis, and there came a boy, who was catching on agnya, so they kept looking at him ,and tried to clear his agnya.  So this boy said that when he went to Mataji, and these girls kept looking at him, this person was really scary looking. I said has any girls ever looked at you ?(everyone laughing)  I said that, no one looks at you, because you are so scary looking, and that is why you have developed a complex, I said to him that these girls have told me that this person has such a big problem on agnya, they thought, if they keep looking at him, he will run away from there.

That is why I am telling you,  all this is avidya (false knowledge) You need to understand all this, that we have these chakras within us and they are active, and because of these undercurrents, we have things activated within us.  Whatever physical problem we have, or whatever mental problems we have, they are because of these three nadis.  The first one is on the left, which is called the Ida nadi, which activate the left sympathetic nervous system .  The one on the right, which we call the Pingala nadi, which activate the right sympathetic nervous system, and the one in center which we call the Sushumna nadi, and this nadi starts the evolution within us.  But for evolution, you have to establish the Dharma within you, as they have just told you that a man has ten religions (dharmas), if they get stabilized, just like when we make a boat, we check if everything is working in a proper way, only then we launch the boat in to the sea.  Just like that when the ten dharmas get stablised in a person only then he becomes a ‘dharmatit’ (beyond any religion) , only then his Kundalini, where the Nabhi chakra is, and all around that is the place of all the Gurus,who stabilizes all the dharmas.  All these Guru’s have incarnated  in this world many times and done such great work.

He has just told you all about how they were, and also our Shirdi Sainath is the last incarnation of the ten Gurus.  And the Laxmi who is sitting on our Nabhi chakra, and the place of Vishnu, because of this we have the desire to evolve, because of this we think about God, and because of this we think that there must be something beyond, something in the unconscious.  We get this vision because of this chakra.  Now this chakra is very important, and the people who mooves towards God through this chakra, they have this big question in front of them, that how to cross this chakra? Because, if you see, that there is a gap in between, and how to fill this gap is a question.  So whenever you sit in front of me with your hands out, even now you should have your hands out, take your shoes off, and you should take it seriously, because this is such a precious thing, and is such a great thing, so it should be taken little seriously.  That does not mean you should be crying, but it should be taken seriously.  Put your hands out, take your shoes off and sit in a proper way.

Now, what happens is that the energy that is flowing from me, is also going to flow from you, just like one candle lighting another candle, like that it happens in Sahaja Yoga, one candle lights another candle.  You too can have this power and you can also use it.  Now there is this gap, so, when I am talking, or when you put your hands towards me, that moment this energy enters in to you, and then it creates a kind of a bridge, and as soon as this bridge has been created, the Kundalini feels that she has been called,  she feels that those who know about her, has arrived, and the Kundalini Shakti rises very easily.

Now, I have seen in some people, this power rises so quickly, means you can say in a split of a second.  Now some people in very high places has experienced it, like there is Dr, Nagendra Sing, the first Indian judge in Hague High Court, he became a chairman there, his Kundalini was awakened so instantly, even I was surprised at that, he was living such a complicated life, and he was such a big government official, he was a secretary of the president, and even after all this,he was very innocent.  As soon as he put his hands out, he got it immediately. And he was able to comprehend it all so quickly, because of being a Devi bhakta (Devotee of the Goddess), he had read all about Markandeya.  Even though he was an ICS, he has not forgotten about his own religion, and despite of going abroad a lot, he kept hold of all the knowledge even more so.  He found out all about it, and he understood everything to be true.

When I returned to Mumbai, his wife was not there, so he sent her immediately by plane, to go and get your enlightenment from Mataji.  We knew each other for many years, but I never told him that I was ‘Mataji’, etc, because you know the position of my husband  in my other life etc,  and because he use to see me with him , he didn't know that I have this other life too.  So as soon as he found out about it, he sent his wife to get realization.

Similarly, there was a Justice Vaidya, he in his lecture, he told that I was just sitting with my hands towards Mataji, he was made to sit next to me, such a great Justice Vaidya, and he was made to sit next to me, but he was such a humble man, and as soon as he sat there, he said that, it felt like there were two balls of ice in his hands and as they melted it went up, and after that the way he achieved his realization, he was very much benefited from it.  Then there was Justice Mitra from Calcutta and others also got their realization.  Many such things has happened, but unless and until, you yourself do not experience it, it does not mean anything to you.  Because there is no such thing as advertising about it, or no voting system for it,  and I am not to gain anything out of it, only you people will gain.

If you do pranks or misbehave in any way, these days it is very easy to that, to make fun of things, by making fun of things, we think that we have become very wise and showing off, but what have you gained?  You have to get something out of this, I have come to give you, not come here to take anything from you!  You have to think in a way that if we have to gain from it and if we have not managed it so far, but on the other hand a villager understands that, ‘Mataji, I have not got it’, he will be insisting that, ‘how is it I have not got it?’  He understands it, because he has the spiritual sensitivity in him, because we have come to the city and living with false and artificial ideas, living an artificial life, we have become so artificial that whatever is true and essential has escaped us, and because of that, so many does not experience it.

Still if I have worked in a hell like London, then Rahuri seems like a very holy place to me, and here, there are  genuine people like you, who work on the farm, they must get it, it has to happen.  But the people who believe in foolish things, like making fun of others,playing pranks, they will not get it.

Now out of these six chakras, the second chakra is called Swadhishthan chakra, through this chakra we become active, through this chakra  we think, we plan, and we think about future.  That means, all your studies, science, etc, and it also make some of your organs function.  Your liver, pancreas, spleen, kidneys, and uterus all these things function due to this chakra.  Therefore, because of so much is depending on one chakra, if you start thinking too much and think excessively, then all these organs I have just mention, they do not get any supply (help)  and that is the reason,there are diseases like diabetes, livers disease,or kidney diseases.  Now if I say to you that do not think, then you will say that, ‘Mataji,how can that be,how can we manage without thinking?’  Now to tell you one thing is that, there is a thing called‘thought’ and another is an ‘inspiration’. Whatever science has come in to existence in this world, is because of an inspiration, not by thinking.

Now lets see, you try to think, and watch where it goes, first of all it will go to that, Mataji is talking, then she is wearing a Khadi sari, then which village they have come from, and then about the buffalo, after that somewhere else, like this the thoughts will go on and on, they have no meaning, you don’t achieve anything from it.  But if you become thoughtless, suppose if it happens that you become thoughtless, then you get inspiration, and the knowledge which is inspirational is the real perception.   Whatever is not inspirational is not real knowledge, it is just a thought, and is artificial, and not in any way at all beneficial.  Once you get in to the habit of thinking, people think too much in foreign countries.  Then what happens, is that man goes on thinking , like he has grown horns, he is not able to stop thinking.  Day and night he goes on thinking, and because of overthinking,  absolutely suffocating himself with the thoughts.

(don’t talk, need to be disciplined, must remember that these people are writing about you people, the people who have come from foreign countries are writing about you. When I go to some big Universities there, no one even says a word, this much I can tell you about them, they have very good concentration, because they reached that state, where you people still need to reach. So don’t try to be too clever.)

So in these six chakras, the second one, which we call the Swadhishthan chakra, which is the place of Shri Bramhadev, and Saraswati.  When this chakra gets awakened, and illuminated by the arrival of the Kundalini, then the person gets inspired to write poems and thinks of different color combinations.  Means he becomes a great artist.  There was a gentleman in Sahaja Yoga, who had lost his job, he came to me, and his Swadisthan chakra was so beautiful, he had never done any artistic work, so this chakra was completely intact in him.  So when this chakra was awakened him, he was asking that, Mataji, what do you think I should be doing now? I said you should do interior decoration, he said, I do not even know anything about wood, I do not know anything about all different kinds of wood, I said you just do it.  Then he got a job to do interior decoration, and now he has become a millionaire and he is also a great Sahaja Yogi.

So what I want to say is that, when this chakra gets awakened in you, you will have this power within you,  the power of concentration, and you are able to do many things.  There is a lady sitting here, who is a writer and she has done lot of writing,  but since she has come in Sahaja Yoga, her writing has become exceptional, and is in such a demand, that she doesn’t know what she should write and how much to write.  Now she is going to write about you also, that how were the students here, and how they absorbed it all, and how they benefited from it.  Today is first time she has given a lecture, she said that she has never given a lecture before.  I said, you just stand up, the Saraswati will start speaking through you, you don’t need to worry.  This is how the Saraswati gets awakened in you. Then there were some children in Sahaja Yoga, their parents were saying that my son does not want to study, he does not pay attention in class, we have really hard time etc, and today, the same boy passed in BSC with first class. We have many examples like these.  The same thing will happen to you also, if this chakra is awakened in you properly, it will work out quickly.

The chakra above that I have mentioned, is the Nabhi chakra, this chakra is specially very important for the farmers, because the food we eat is digested through this Nabhi chakra.  Now if you have to sow the wheat, normally people who sow wheat, now my nephews has not come, they also live here, they also have farm, many of our professors also have done farming,   Similarly, our Mr, Mane, I gave him three dried coconuts, he asked, Mataji, what shall I do with them , I said, the atmosphere in your house is not so good, so bury them in there, and after burying them, somebody by mistake tiled over it, but there was so much vibrations in them , that they came out (started growing), by braking the flour. I went to Mr. Chavhan’s house last year, he had a little bottle brush plant, and today it has grown double in size, he said Mataji, because you had come and stood there, you must have given it some vibrations, you had told me that the leaves of this plant has a very nice fragrance etc, and it has actually grown double the size.  So in this way we get these enlightened vibrations within us, these vibrations themselves are very powerful , and not only powerful, but the power upon which the whole Universe is running, that energy is flowing through our hands, it touches the wheat and whatever food we eat.

The first time ever the man is able to give something back to the nature, and helps the nature blossom.  Many people have told me that, Mataji, the area, where we have planted the vibrated wheat, it did not get any disease.  Another amusing thing somebody told me that, the grains of this wheat are so big and juicy, they told me that we stored this wheat in a store room, where there were lots of other sacks also stored, and the mice had eaten everything else but did not touch this wheat.  Similarly they told me many examples of rice, one gentleman told me a lot about rice, that the field where rice did not use to grow very well, there, the rice has grown ten times more, and nice long grains of rice.  They said that when you cook this rice , there is such a beautiful fragrance. We know that basmati rice does not have that much fragrance, but this rice has such a beautiful fragrance, he came specially to show me this rice, and I was really surprised.

Also I came to a place, the year before last,  there was a papaya tree, which was dying, I said to them that don’t remove it, I will give it vibrations, let’s see what happens, after giving vibrations, when I went back the year after, I saw that it had such big papayas, and the colour of it was so beautiful and golden. Also I saw the color of the vibrated bananas here, so it really has to be seen in a  scientific way, that how, by giving vibrations, the crops grown are so nourishing and how blessed it is, that, the birds or mice don’t eat away the grains. They also understand the auspiciousness, they also know that this is something very pure.

It is something  very remarkable that how everything is protected, but all this is to be understood, and even more important is to achieve it.  A person from a village, who is not so intelligent, he doesn’t understand science, but  he achieves realization. Did our Sainath (Shirdi Sai baba) know any science?  Did Christ go to any University?  But today, all the people from big University believe in him, and they say that, Christ has given us this and he has told us that, They can see something special in everything what Christ said. What that means is, the education is well and good, I am not against education, but if you want to turn the false knowledge in to the true knowledge, then first of all you have to learn about God.  To know that why God has created the Universe, why has he created us, what are his powers, you have to be able to make use of all this. Then you will realize that, what an ‘authority’ you have to be able to get this power, but animals can not get it, chickens can not get it, no one could get it, only human beings could achieve this, and only human beings could know God, and only he can operate the power of God.  So if this is the situation now, then there is no point in denying it.

It will take too long to talk about each chakra, so I will not tell you about everything. These three Sahaja Yogis, who are well known in London and Switzerland. Also there is a book to be published ,there is a special mention of Rahuri in that book.  In this way, there is a great work happening in this little place like Rahuri.  So if you do not achieve it, even after coming here, and living in this holy land, then people will say that, you were living in Rahuri, and there is this great thing happening there, then how could you not get it, and how did you not come to know about it? The reason for that is, we have not yet reached that depth. You do not have to do any special work for that, because, many people think, if we start doing the yoga, then we will have to give up this, give up that. Do not have to give up anything, all these ideas are all imagination. What are you going to give up, If you are not holding on to anything in the first place?  This is another false idea that, we are holding on to something, and we have to give it up.

So, you do not have to give up anything, nor you have to make any big sacrifice, you just have to be a human being.  Now if there is someone like Hitler, and if he says to me that, Mataji, you must give it to me, then, you have no right.  You have to have a little bank balance with God also, if you have that, then you will definitely get it.  Suppose a child has killed his father, or killed his mother, or he has caused a lot of destruction, or he has committed really big crime, which he can not be forgiven even by God, at such times, it becomes difficult for him to get realization.  But I have seen very few people like that, I have not yet met anyone like that, who can not be forgiven.  Because God is an ocean of compassion, he is an ocean of kindness,  he is eternal, and in that ocean, all your sins get washed away.  I have witnessed that with my own eyes, and the people, who, I thought would never get their realization., they also have received it very easily, it is very surprising.

People in high places, like when I went to Singapore, there was one gentleman, who used to take part in races, indulge in funny business,etc.  His wife was quite fed up about it, and she said that, Mataji, if you could change this man then I will believe in you.  I said, see you should not challenge me!  It is good if he changes, if he doesn’t change, then he doesn’t change.  I don’t desire for anything.  So they brought him along, and after getting realization, his life has become so beautiful and pure, that his wife is so surprised.  He gave up drinking, smoking, and everything.  So when we have so much joy within our self, then we don’t enjoy all these worldly things.  Then, we eat it (Joy), we speak it, we remain in that state, be engrossed in it, it is so enjoyable.  But for that, there is no such thing like you have to leave your home, or you can not get married etc.  Wherever, there are parents living with good feelings, where the children are living with pure feelings, that is where our Sahaja Yoga will reach.  Not for these sanyasis, they are sanyasis for only name sake, why do they have to advertise about themselves? If you are a sanyasi, then it should show from inside, it should show from your behavior.

Now you are the youth of this country, and whatever has to happen with young people, will happen.  There is a very big difference between the youth of our country and the youth of foreign country, a very big difference, and I could always feel it.  After so much of struggle, the youth of foreign country has become very disturbed, they had to struggle a lot, and they understand that, there is no God in the blind faith.  They say that, after getting lot of shocks in life, we have fallen in to a ditch. So when a man falls in the ditch completely, then only he makes effort to get out of it.  But we have not fallen in to the ditch yet, we are on that path, and so we are running towards it.  These people have fallen in the ditch, that is why they are making effort to come out of it, but a surprising thing is, that you people are born in this Yogabhoomi, is because of your special good fortune (punyas)first of all, and compared to those people (from foreign countries) you get the benefits of Sahaja Yoga very easily, because you have that wealth of good fortune with you.

I really have to work very hard there (foreign countries), and you people do not want to know about Sahaja Yoga, and people who are struggling a lot, they really strive for Sahaja Yoga so much. You will be surprised that, after coming to Sahaja Yoga, these people worked so hard to find out all abut your Gods and Goddesses ect, read all about Shankaracharya and everything.  They studied everything with great passion, all in a scientific way, and they go on studying. I took them to Gandhis’ place, so they found out all the books about him and going to read all about it.  They are absolutely absorbed in it. And you only see one or two of these people here, but  there are 300 of them in London, who are studying everything seriously, and thousands of them have got their self realization.  So the big difference between them and you is, that within you there is still an unruliness, you still don’t have that depth and stillness in you.  Because once you fall in a pit, then you remember about God.  But it has not happened yet, still, the thinking is, that it will be all right, if we do this and that. But It is not at all like that, you will experience all that in this very life, no need to look in to the future.

This is the most important time of your life, very important, this is the time when you have to establish yourself from within, and whatever you will establish within yourself now,  will be accounted for in the future, otherwise you will be completely useless.  So at this time you have to make a decision to make yourself invaluable (Precious) by achieving something valuable.  And you have that innately in you. I have told you many times that, you being born in this country is the main principle and because you were born in this country, you should take it with that dignity, with that seriousness, have to settle within yourself.  The greatness of this country is such that, it will be overwhelming for the entire Universe.  But ‘you’ have to make this happen, these young people should make it happen.  But where is our young generation going today?when I think about this, I get scared. What has happened? How these useless people come to be born in this country? I don’t understand!

Sometimes I feel that, all the beasts (animals) who has taken birth in the world, have they all been born in India or what? If one person start pulling in one direction, then everybody start to follow in the same direction, I am so very surprised to see that, even some cinema actor have become your leader!  It is OK to see movies, but for them to become your leader, and to feel that their life is something very special that you have to copy it, then, I don’t understand that if you are from India, (Bharat) or have come from some monkey region.

The specialty (characteristic) of our land, the boundaries (Maryadas) we have, we are very great people.  Even if you look in to thousand people, you will not find a single person like it. Such great people we are!  There, still flows, the Faith, and  Dharma from our homes, we have taken birth in a great country of viras (the warriors) we had great characters like Shivaji Maharaj in our country, and to see these youngsters like this, feel very sad, that how is it possible, and why? What is the reason for this? Otherwise your professors are very good, and even if the professors were bad, your parents are very great people, then, from where and how such generation has come? Today, due to this generation this country is going to achieve great things.  Now these political leaders etc, are going to be finished, and you are going to take their place, you are going to be the leaders of tomorrow.  So you have to realize your own importance, realize your own dignity, and respect yourself.  Should follow the truth and throw away, whatever is, false, foolish and unruly.  Tomorrow you have to take your place in the kingdom of God.  I will also have to respect you people, as these people are being respected today.  You are going to be even more respected all over the world.

When I went to Japan, I was surprised that, they told me, they have not yet met a single Indian person who knows anything about Yoga, or about Shankarachrya,it is such a shameful thing.  When I went to Kerala, all the big journalists came there, and started saying that , Mataji,we are not going to publish anything, unless you provide bottles of alcohol for us then  I said ,no problem, if you are going to publish in return for the bottle of alcohol then I don’t want anything to be published, and I don’t want such kind of publicity .  I asked them, if they know who  Adi Shankaracharya was, these people, who are born in Kerala, and they said, they don’t know.  So, do you have any knowledge?- leave alone enlightenment.  Asking for bottle of liquor to Mataji, what to say?  So you are the citizens of tomorrow, not only that but you are the Sahaja Yogis of tomorrow!  Not only that, but you have an authority on the kingdom of God.  So, may you immerse yourself in that and swim in that joy, this is my complete blessing to you
