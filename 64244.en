Public Program for Doctors, Moscow (Russia), August 7th, 1993

[The beginning is missing]

Shri Mataji: So, Mother must cure. And some of them are following me when I am in London, in Spain, they are after my life all around. But they missed me all the time. I said, "You’d better go to the Sahaja centre". "But the Sahaja Yogis are not doctors. So, we don’t want to have treatment from Sahaja Yogis who are not doctors". That's why I'm requesting you people, because people have faith in you. They trust you. They think you are noble people. They have faith in your degrees. They think you are compassionate; you are honest. That's why I've been talking to doctors.

Now at least, I hope here, in Russia, some of you will really get to the knowledge of Sahaja Yoga. We need many doctors to do that. There was a spin that a hospital would be was going to give us a wing where we could start Sahaja Yoga. [To the translator]. There was a proposal that some hospital was going to give us a wing for Sahaja Yoga.Translator: Yes.Shri Mataji: But, last 4 years, nothing has happened. Before this, I have been telling you all about Sahaja Yoga. But today, I must tell you about doctors. I have told you why I am very anxious that doctors should take to Sahaja Yoga knowledge. Why? I also studied medicine because I had to talk to doctors. Just open your mind; it is meta-science. It’s miraculous. You enter into another realm of reality and totality. Just have confidence. You can do so much good to your people.

But tomorrow, in the history, how will doctors of modern times, of Russia, will do that taking care for their people? They didn’t bother at all to take this Sahaja Yoga to people. Because, one day, you’ll create this realm. If not in your time, it will be later definitely. Already we had thousands and thousands of Sahaja Yogis in Russia and Ukraine. They themselves can cure. But because there are no doctors, you see, it has no [4:58 Hindi?]. Why don’t you also just try to form a research and find out if what we say is true or not. If you, doctors, are not going to take any step, tomorrow people will say, "What was wrong with them?" If the whole thing is brought to you, completely open, much more effective than medical science, why should you not take to it? Still, I can’t understand doctors.

Especially, when I was studding, in our college we were only six girls. They were all very noble people. They had great ideas about doing something for the country. But till then, I have not found out Sahaja Yoga on a collective basis. And now, I am 71. And they are even older than me, they were even older. Some of them are no more and some of them are very old. That generation, we have lost, which had idealism, which had compassion, which had higher values, human values.

But if you get your Kundalini awakened, I am sure you all will find that all these great qualities are manifesting in you. You will become extremely dynamic and extremely compassionate. I am sorry I have to say these things to you. But you must feel my concern for Russian people and Ukrainian people. They are wonderful people. I can’t expect American doctors to come round. As it is, I think Americans are idiotic compared to you people. Others are egoistical. But I again appeal to your sense. Because I know since long time, I have been visiting Russia, that Russians are extremely wise people and with very large hearts. Thank you very much.[Shri Mataji does 'namaste'] That’s all for Russians [unsure].
