Public Program for Doctors, Moscow (Russia), August 7th, 1993

[The beginning is missing]

Shri Mataji: So, Mother must cure. And some of them are following me when I am in London, in Spain, they are after my life all around. But they missed me all the time. I said, "You’d better go to the Sahaja centre". "But the Sahaja Yogis are not doctors. So, we don’t want to have treatment from Sahaja Yogis who are not doctors". That's why I'm requesting you people, because people have faith in you. They trust you. They think you are noble people. They have faith in your degrees. They think you are compassionate; you are honest. That's why I've been talking to doctors.
