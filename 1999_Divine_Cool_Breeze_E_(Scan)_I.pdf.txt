So when, at the beginning of the interview, we put our attention at Shri Mataji's Lotus Feet, imagining Her in beautiful Cabella, we felt such strong vibrations that we were the series of a half-hour interviews about Shri Mataji and Sahaja Yoga on TV in Florida, USA, is progressing and the producer of the show is very excited to continue interviewing us. concerned for a moment that it would be The second interview was scheduled difficult to speak! Everything went very and we were prepared with video clips of Shri Mataji's lectures, backup material smoothly This show will be on the air three times and the like Then the producer called and in the beginning of June, and will reach a potential audience of 500,000 people. The interviewer was quite impressed and asked great questions. She is coming to get her Self-Realization in a few days. By the way! Thank you, Shri Mataji, for all your blessings! Thank you, dear brothers. and sisters, for all your support and asked if it would be possible to record the third show together with the second, because someone else had cancelled a slot! Caught by surprise, we started thinking, "What could the third topic be? What video material can we edit within hours that would be broadcast quality?" enlightened attention! Then we thought of the obvious-why not give them Self-Realization? After all, this is what Sahaja Yoga is all about, isn't it? So we got hold on a broadcast-quality video of a meditation with Shri Mataji and told the producer we were ready.

She has learned to speak After so many years in America, this was a dream come true. We were so very well and very simply about Sahaja- the fruits of all those years in Dharamsala.

You can all imagine As I reflect on what is happening here, our Holy Mother's words keep ringing in my ears-that Americans have to spread Sahaja Yoga globally. That is the responsibility of America.

Not only that, the scientists specially, are very open minded and they were suppressed very much. So, they tried to find out the subtler Sahasrara when we are on a boat. So he said, she is the source of all the cosmic energy, and that's what the Adishakti is. things. Not oniy finding out about She is the one who creates everything. chemicals or about some physical The whole atmosphere that we know of is very artificial But when you properties of the light. but they wanted to go into the subtler side and they had found out already a great deal of understand what She has done - the first knowledge about the auras around the thing She does is to (in my book also I hands, auras around the body They had done so much of research, and was like to tell you) that Her first, we should accepted all over the world, their findings say, manifestation is on the left hand side. Now, this gentleman was a specialist, 1 That is the Mahakali's manifestation. So think, because he is a very very well have written down about it but I would She comes on the Mahakali's system, the left hand side and that is where She known person and he is holding a very created Ganesha. Shri Ganesha is created because of His purity, His innocence and auspiciousness. This had to be created before She created the universe, So first thing She does is to create Shri Ganesha and She settled down. Then She goes up. off course in the body of the virata, and big position He was saying that he has to run 150 organisations. Very humble and very nice person, and when he came out with this discovery, I was happy in a way because scientifically. if it is proved , then no body can challenge it. He has already written a book, with all the algebraical complications of what he wanted to prove, and he said, beyond the consciousness there is a vacuum, and in there She goes round and goes up on the right hand side in the other way, and there She creates all the universes, as you call them Bhuwanas'-one universe. There are that vacuum only you can know the reality And once all this becomes the fourteen Bhunwanas means this many many universes make one Bhuwana And reality it is a science. And that is how it is made into science. He showed so many She creates all these things on the right

 Jan - Feb. 1999 Volume : XI isue : 1 & 2 18 The Divine Cool Breeze hand side. Then She goes up and then She another book that I am going to write descends down creating all these now. I mean, I have mostly finished but chakras-Adi chakras or the pithas. She there are some more chakras to be dealt comes down, makes all these pithas and with). Now with this happening, you see then She settles as the Kundalini we can one thing is there that whatever I write, say, Kundalini is a part of it. The rest of now people won't doubt. They will know the work is much more than this. So all it is a scientific fact and that whatever I the residual energy means after going through all this journey, then She comes round and She goes as Kundalini. Because say is a fact. Now to believe in the Mother, the Adishakti was impossible. Specially you of this Kundalini and the chakras, She will be amazed that christian religion creates an area which we call as the somehow or other avoided it, the mentioning of the Mother. Then the chakras in the body. Now first She creates these chakras in the head we call them Islam, that also avoided the mentioning of the Mother. There is complet negation towards the Mother. But only Indian philosophy had the Mother, and the Indians are actually Shakti worshippers. So this is how it was kept up and brought to this position now that people have got the pithas of the chakras, and then She comes down and creates these chakras which are in the body of virata. Now once this has happened then She creates human beings but not directly, through the evolutionary process - She goes through. and that is how the evolution starts, and full idea as to Mother Principle that has worked out everything. On this Mother principle in India people are very sure that it is Mother who does everything. And thus we have in India many, we should then it stats developing from the minute small little microscopic organisms in the water and then it starts evolving. So when She creates water and She creates all the universes, She chooses this mother earth say, 'Swayambhus' means the things that as the best place to play her evolutionary process. And there She makes this little microscopic thing. (off course I have example we know in Maharashtra we written all about it, and when my book are created out of the Mother Earth. For Mahakali's place, have got Mahasaraswati, Mahalaxmi and also we will be released you can see that how have got a place for the Adi Shakti. Some people who have been to Nasik, must have seen a Chaturshindi (How many first hydrogen, carbon and oxygen and all of these things got mixed up, and how nitrogen comes into play, and how a living people have been to Chaturshindi out of process starts. All this, I have done in my

 Volume XI isue 1&2 Jan-Feb: 1999 The Divine Cool Breeze freedom they have, it is such a turmoil in this world, and people who were incharge of affairs, they were very very cruel and had no feelings for the other people. And this happened so many times on this you? It is good). So, this Chaturshindi represents the Adishakti, which is the fourth dimension of this power which gives you the ascent, and ultimately through Maha Lakshmi Channel only you get your realisation All this is a process- all was created by the power of Adishakti. It is a tremendous task Though previous earth. Now, Sahaja Yoga has started. Once Sahaja Yoga has started, we have Sahaja Yogis who are now receiving the blessings nature to ereate was very easy The of the Adishakti directly. But still I must Mother earth is one with the Adishakti, say among Sahaja Yogis also we don't the whole atmosphere is one with the have people whom I would call as very Adishakti, all the elements are one with well matured They are Sahaja Yogis. ones were not difficult because there, for So She could create all that the Adishakti some of them are just because it is a fashion, may be it should be better from without any difficulties But when human beings came-they got their freedom. That is the only species which fell into the their angle, or from their selfish angle or whatever it is. It is a very wrong thing. If you are in Sahaja Yoga you must know now you are responsible for the whole world. You are the only people who have come forward, you are the only people who have achieved something and then their own right that they are there, this is at this juncture you should behave in a their own achievement and they are the manner that behoves a big saint or a owners of everything This started realised soul. But sometimes you find working in their mind so much that they them behaving in such a manner - it is invaded other countries, they destroyed shocking sometimes. They have no so many people, and they never felt bad respect for themselves, or for others, and their whole attitude is very funny Some thinking about aggressing others, of them are money oriented, some of them maya' of thinking and of having ego in it. With this ego, 'maya' worked on them, I should say, and they forgot about the principle that created this universe. They took it for granted. They felt that this is about it All their lives they have been controlling others, and doing all kinds of harmful things. But they never even are power oriented, and those who are power oriented are more dangerous, I think, than money oriented. Because those who are power oriented, try to bring such bad name to Sahaja Yoga. They are thought or never did introspection to see that what we are doing is very very wrong and it should not be done. Because of the

 Jan Feb 1999 The Divine Cool Breeze 20 Volume XI Issue: 182 very insulting, dominating and horrible people. Their whole attitude is to achieve people. Everybody should understand and know how many people we have given 15 realisation. We have to think about it. power in Sahaja Yoga, and they try all tricks to achieve that power But for sonme What have we done for Sahaja Yoga? time they look all right, after some time Once I was travelling by plane and, I saw you will find they will disappear from the a lady sitting next to me. She was so hot, field of Sahaja Yoga. It is a very big she is a disciple of a guru. Very proud of cleansing process going on. You must understand that you have come in the field him. Then she started telling me all about him. I was amazed that-look at this. of very high consciousness where you are in contact with the Divine Now here if woman, she hasn't got anything from him and she was just saying I have given so much money to him, I have done this thing to him, and all those things. But she had nothing and despite that she was talking you behave like ordinary people who have no divinity within them, how long will you continue like this. So this is very important that you should try to meditate and evolve yourselves and become really very good Sahaja Yogis. In some places we are very very lucky, in some countries we are very very lucky, but in some countries I find to me as stranger person about the guru. But in Sahaja Yoga I have seen people are rather shy They don't want to talk about Sahaja Yoga openly to others which is a very wrong thing you are doing because you are responsible for this You the people are just deaf and dumb, they can't understand Sahaja Yoga, For my programme they do come and afterwards have been given realisation. Of course, you were seeking, every thing is all right but all of you must try to give realisations just they disappear. I think Sahaja Yogis to others. I must say that somehow men are responsible for this. The way they go have been more dynamic, and working it about, the way they want to do Sahaja out, the women in Sahaja Yoga are not work is not Sahaja Must be something yet coming upto that level as they should definitely wrong with the whole thing, and They have to be more sensible about it, that is why it is not working out the same and they have to work it out. They can way as it is working out in many places. do it but only trouble is, I think, they have certain minor problems about which they are worried. Always I get letters from ladies saying this is wrong, that is wrong complaining all the time. I am so fed up of their letters now that I think they are useless, to read them also. So I have to tell you all, that it is important that men So I have to tell you that all this is there, that Adi Shakti is there, and all this is happened through Adi Shakti But now the further work has to be done through you people Because you are the channels. you are the ones who have to transform

 Jari - Feb. 1999 21 Volume : XI IsSUe: 182 others, talking about the defects of Sahaja Yoga. I would say it is still a very preliminary things that have happened because they are dynamic, women should be much more because they are Shakti, and I am a woman. So I find that the men are more sort of, active and dynamic before, and it should stop now. about Sahaja Yoga and I don't know what Now as it is, once this book is out all over the world, it will be known about our work. We will not be challenged any more but still we have to see for ourselves that if we have achieved this kind of recognition then we should be upto that, is the reason why wome are not? They can transform so many people, they can do so much good to others, they can bring so much love and compassion because this love and compassion is a quality of a Mother, of a woman, and if the women our capability should be upto that, we don't have that quality, it is useless to be should not be lagging behind. For a woman All the time if you are busy example if you ask some Sahaja Yogis, about your useless things like fashions or specially Sahaja Yoginis, they don't know THE faces and all that then the time is all wasted. You have a short time now, you got your realisation and you must decide what have you done so far, what have you much about Sahaja Yoga, they don't know about chakras, they don't know any thing, about the deities, nothing they know, how can they be Sahaja Yogis. You achieved so far. have to know all about it. Only thing that you don't realise that it is not outside that you are a Sahaja Yogi but it is inside Inside you have to have that kind of an understanding of the chakras, and of Sahaja Yoga how it works, how it helps. Now, supposing if I am the source of that energy which you know very well I am, But I would say that in Sahaja Yoga I have found, there are all kinds of funny ideas growing in Like they prescribe eertain rituals, they will talk about it, and kind of a power orientation is there. They want to oppress others, and they want to take over and frighten people, and behave then you achieve yours also a kind of a in such a manner as if they are very good. perfection about dealing with people and bringing them to Sahaja Yoga It is a very important work you have to do is to bring Sahaja Yogis in Sahaja Yoga What I find that some people are very much still lagging behind and it is very surprising that they live in that country, they are part Some of them start saying that "Mataji said so", this is Mataji's idea By their own power orientation they manufacture things and talk like that but ask them how many have you given realisation? First thing is you must determine his positivity. how many have you given realisation He is just talking about others, criticising and parcel of that country and they are

 Jan - Feb 199 22 Issue 1 & 2 Xi Volume The Divine Cool Breeze are doing-which in India, which is a poor not bothered. Under these circumstances country, one cannot even think of such things happening around you. So find out what is wrong, where and how you can correct these things. If you can help them, actually, now as I have told you I am going to start some sort of organisations that will do good to human beings, but you all can join also. You can also start in they will be blamed that why didn't you find out the ways and methods of convincing at least to your countrymen. So Sahaja Yoga at the brink of growth cannot grow only with one country, two countries All the countries have to be brought into Sahaja Yoga All the people that you could call, into Sahaja Yoga will be a very good idea, and then we have books to convince people. You have to your own countries something like that. But first, you have to get rid off of talk to them about it. But, what 1 find your ego. That once happens to you then only your attention would be steady, and about Sahaja Yogis is that once they start spreading Sahaja Yoga also, their ego comes up. And they think they are very this ego is very simple for you because great Sahaja Yogis, they are great leaders you worship Christ. And the Christ is the all this kind of stupid ideas walk into their one who was settled on the Agnya chakra. heads which is wrong You have to just You all worship Christ, but that humility think in a very humble manner, the more of Christ is not there. Just a opposite of you have, the more you become humble. it. It has happened everywhere that whatever is preached in the religion Like a tree wvhen laden with fruits bends down In the same way you have to be people did just the opposite of that. For very humble But that humility is example, in Hindu religion, I would say sometimes very difficult because the Hindu Philosophy is that in everybody culture of the west is not humble culture: resides the spirit: Now, in everybody if there is a spirit then how can you have different caste systems, and how can you have somebody higher and lower. Other- way round, now-Christ has said that you have to forgive, forgive everyone, and you haveto humble down, and that's what one finds that among Christians they don't know humility, they have no idea of It is a culture of aggression, culture of domination so far they have heen nothing. because of domination they could go all over the world, they could achieve so many things. What have they achieved? Nothing In their own countries if you see there is drug addiction. Why should people take to drugs so much. Then all kinds of sinful things they do which I don't humility. Men are like that, women are like that and the men and women they want to mention But you know what they

 23 Jan Feb, 1999 Volume XI Issue 1&2 The Divine Cool Breeze very very humble, and people take me for granted I don't do anything, 1 do not want to punish you, I don't want to do anything-but you yourself get punished, you yourselfbecome useless if you do not look after yourself and grow yourself have gone for fighting There is no question of anybody being humble. peaceful and all that. So it is very artificial they are showing off that they are very philanthropist and all that. But inside in their heart I deon't find there is any love. there is any compassion in the real sense of the word. So when we are dealing with the reality they have to know that we This finding is so great and this man had never known me before He is very learned but he is very humble, and what cannot just go on with things which are he told me that "just imagine I am sitting before the creator of this world and still I u artificial, which are befooling others. But we have to really become that Once you become that, when you are really like that am very normal". I said what should - then only you have done the job for happen to you, what do you think. He which you are born at this juncture of said, "Mother, it is a big thing to realise blossom times. Otherwise you could have that I am sitting before you, and that you been born earlier, and could have been are here". I said it is good that you don't something different. But you are specially feel my presence so oppressive, so born. So you realise your value, realise yourself what you are, and try to understand, have self respect and try to just felt the love, just felt the compassion, That's what it is. We have to know that we should have just love and compassion. do things which are very important as Sahaja Yogis. Off course, you are doing a job, you are doing other things. But you will be amazed if you do the work of heart To say something to hurt someone, Sahaja Yoga - you will find more time Compassion and love for ourselves in the way, that should not harm any body's is every sinful. But some people enjoy that for every thing. Once you start doing very much, they think they are very clever, God's work, God does your work and Il is not so. When you talk to someone that's how you will be amazed how you you must say something which is very soothing and good. Another thing is a temper that a slightest thing here and Now it is for you to go back and there, they get into temper. Now this has See for vourself Now the Adi to be told, this temper. that you keep Shakti herself has come But I am very quiet Ihave nothing to do with you. That simple to look at, in my behaviour I am is one thing Then there are people who get so much time to do the right thing introspect.

 Jan-Feb. 1999 Volume XI lssuD:182 The Divine Cool Breeze so sweetly. This is something surprising. how these people in Russia, have achieved that capability to become. And, are very subtly. I should say, power oriented. Very subtle. They have tricks and trades by which they know how to I think in the West Russia is the country which will achieve very great height in spirituality. And that means they will be the most powerful people. Let us see what you are doing in your own country? And how you are going to work it out. See. there are so many things you can do very easily if you see for yourself that you are the instrument of the divine. And then your temperament will change, the nature will change, you will become a very very sweet person, likeable person, and control others. What are you going to gain out of it? What is youIr gain? By doing all these things what will happen? In these worldly things you might be little bit popular, little bit having a position or something. But what is it, after all? That is not going to help you. What is going to help you the most, is to make yourself a perfect channel for Sahaja Yoga: To be a perfect Channel, in that you will be amazed how you will be happy So would say for you people who are in the I west, I would say you must develop everybody will think that this is a saint humility. It is very important. I was walking around. surprised in Russia itself the people are not only humble but such dedication, such Whatever is the discovery is not a So that's all I have to say about this dedication, unbelievable They don't even discovery for me, but discovery for the whole world. And I am sure, once it is established, and is exposed to the whole world, things will change for you and for me also. raise their eyes to me I don't know how they got this idea., This is not after the discovery but even before that. They are so nice and so humble, and so full of love, and even the children brought me small small presents. you know just to give me May God Bless You!

It is important to know that Sahaja spreading. But we should Salhaja Yoga is Truth and we are firmly understand that a living thing develops Footed in it. We have to, therefore, discard slowly; e g: slow growth of a tree, the untrue, otherwise we cannot attain blooming of a few at first and gradually purity. Matter-of-fact-untruth is an illusion and we should decide to get out of it With just pure desire for this end No one will get realized by just saying our awakened Kundalini puts us in a state Until it happens we can give false of pace many flowers on it. Sahaja Yoga is a living process, we cannot force it on anyone. certificate to none And we cannot say it where we could discern as to what is Truth for certain that every one will get realization, for a number of reasons many and what untruth, and we start longing to attain only the Truth Giving up all our people do not get realized There are some who think that for Sakhshatkara misconceptions we have to take to Truth.

They do not have the capacity to see that it is the blossom time and realization cast" is incorrect because Vyasa, the writer of Gita. was himself the son of a fisherwoman, no one knew who his father was.

 26 Jan - Feb. 1999 Volume: XI Issue: 1& 2 The Divine Cool Breeze note of the qualities and inherent beauty of others. It will serve double purpose i e. beautify our personality and remove fault of others. We have to remember that everything for us, we get detached and become Akarmi Nothing worries us. On coming to Sahaja Yoga, due to short- sightedness in the beginning one considers oneself the doer, Slowly, as one gets experienced, one understands that, man does nothing. Parama Chaitanya does everything Everything gets done smoothly Some-times, if something goes others are not separated form their-selves and as such we should correct their faults with the power of Divine love. Love is Truth and Truth is Love. One who uses the power of love ascends very high With open hearts you have to see people with love This is how against our desires, even then we should not think that God has not helped us In fact we could neither think nor do more than God, so we have to accept that you develop individually and collectively We should be beware of the person who Parama Chaitanya has done the appropriate and what is coming up is very is not collective. Listening to the ill of others is a guilt in Sahaja Yoga. We should beautiful. observe how softly we could speak and how much power of forgiveness we possess, We should regard all Sahaja There are two aspects about whom a Sahaja Yogi has to be very careful- Firstly through individual meditation we should know our faults: the state of our Yogis as our relatives: The Second aspect of Sahaja Yoga is the knowledge of Sahaja Yoga and its instrument, whether we are Right Sided or Left Sided? Which of our Chakras are spreading. We should have the knowledge that which finger of hand or foot indicates obstructed. By putting our attention on the photograph we could know all this Then in meditation we should clear all the negativity. In Sahaja Yoga Meditation system is very easy. Sitting up for 10-15 minutes in the mornings and evenings we can meditate. After clearing ourselves we the catches of which chakras, which catch could cause which disease and how could it be cured. How could we cure others and all concerned knowledge about Kundalini we must acquire Ladies, being should get into collectivity. Opening of Shaktis, must attain this Knowledge With heart is essential for this: A narrow- the help of this knowledge, ladies will be able to understand Sahaja Children and minded person could never be collective We should not put our attention on the their behavioural pattern. Achievement of faults of others-for by doing so these short comings grab us. We should take this knowledge is most important. Spreading of Sahaja Yoga is another

 Jan- Feb, 199 Volume XI Isue 1&2 The Divine Cool Breeze Guru Puja -1998 Today we have assembled here to do disturbed These disturbing qualities the Guru Puja. The word Guru comes comes from our deficiency in our gravity A person who has gravity doesn't get depressed neither gets excited nor gets overly enthusiastic nor is he very sad or from One which is magnetie. The person who is magnetic, One which attracts the attention of the seekers This is the Guru unhappy So, he is in the centre, he is in the centre of his. But how do we become the Guru? That is very important for Sahaj Yogis to understand. Many have felt that they are Gurus, they have tried to behave in a funny manner and have lost their Guru position. First and foremost things for Sahaja Yogis, it is important that they Also it means that heavy ness or you can say a person who is very steady, who is very deep, who has the knowvledge and who can act like the Mother Earth. For the power of magnetism in the Mother Earth. For the power of magnetism in the mother Earth also is called as magnetic but is Sanskrit- Gurutvakarshan means the attraction of the heavyness of the must have introspection. They must Mother Earth but actually it is a power watch themselves. Ifa person runs about of the Mother Earth that makes us stand changing because of fashion has come, properly on our legs when it is rotating because people have suppressed them or with such a tremendous speed. Otherwise have asked them. Just to please people we would be all thrown away with that cheap values if a person changes then he velocity that she is moving. We are still attached or we are one in our balance is himself properly on the values of Sahaja only because she has gravity. This gravity Yoga. Without introspection you will not cannot be a Guru He has to station know. You will never remember what you has to be in a Guru Gravity means a kind of a serious understanding of oneself and one's own responsibilities. So. a Guru has to be very steady have done wrong nor will you think of what you have to do right but that is only possible if you go on improving yourself In these moderm times people are very mobile. All the time agitated, all the time saints have praised their Guru. For getting disturbed They meet people who example, we have a very great saint are nor of any quality then they get Gyaneshwara in India. He has written First and foremost thing is all the great

 30 dan Feb. 1999 Volume: Xi Issue: 182 The Divine Cool Breeze complete chapter about the Guru, in English they have translated as Preceptor, India who came to one of the ladies who was a Sahaja Yogini and he said that my Guru has sent me a word that Adishakti Guru is the preceptor and what he has done is a great thing He says you are not to challenge the Guru otherwise you can never become a Guru, for name sake you might be but you are not Secondly, you can never misbehave, you can never be rude, arrogant and you cannot show your temper to a Guru. If that is so that means is going to come and stay with you Is it true? She said, Yes! She is going to stay with me, so what? He said, my Guru has told me that you go and request her and if She could come to our ashram. She said,I will ask Mataji. I don't know This fellow came to a programme and he saw me, a house wife! He said, this cannot be you are not a Guru, you are still on a very low level personality. It is very.clearly said that if you try to say against other Gurus who are of a real Gurus, who are very that Guru but when I came in, he saw and when 1 did self realisation that everybody's Kundalini was awakened, he high calibre then also you are not a Guru was so surprised and he prostrated himself before me But I would say that you all have now Now, his Guru was living in got vibrations, you all have got vibratory awareness When you have vibratory awareness, you are capable of finding about everyone. Now you need not talk about your own understanding about a person but try to face that person directly and tell that person this is the problem the ancient times never used to leave their and ask him to change: But in Sahaja Yoga we have something more than other pillow. They never left their Takiya'. I Gurus had Other Gurus were very-very said, alright, I don't mind I'lI come to Amarnath, is a very famous religious place in the Himalyas and this fellow lived in a place called Ambarnath. So, he asked me, Mother, will vou come to my ashram? I said, why not- because these gurus in seat, they called Takiya' means the strict. They used to carry a stick in their your ashram. So, I went there, this Guru hand, a big stick which they used for fell at my feet and he was very-very walking or hitting their disciples. They respectful and then we came back home used to hit their disciples in such a bad and this fellow started telling me if you manner that the disciple was literally don't tell my Guru I would like to tell frightened of the Guru. you that I have got a very bad Agnya Can you cure Mother? 1 said, why no! I Tl give you an example of a Guru I will. So, I went back to this Guru again came across. One fellow was there in and I said, why didn't you cure his Agnya.

 Jan - Feb 1999 31 Volume XI Issue : 1&2 The Divine Cool Breeze that his Guru came back and he put me He said, why? Why I should cure? Who cured my Agnya? I worked out myself I hanging on a well and he used to every had to introspect, find out and I cured my own Agnya and why should I cure his the water, ten times he did it. I asked, but Agnya? Let him work! Let him get to this otherwise he will be a spoiled man. I because he found me smoking a cigarette, was quite surprised and he said you do it my goodness! So, I asked his Guru, I said, because you are a Mother. You are why do you do such horrible things to nothing but love and that's why you are doing all this for others but not me No don't do like this, they will never rise, they Guru will open the Agnya of his disciples. I said, then why are you a Guru? He said, them and the more you forgive the worse because we have to guide them and if they they become and they will show no ascent have their Agnya badly caught up if their at all. So, you have to be very strict with attention is not alright, I'am not bothered them, please don't spoil them all the time. about it. It is their duty to introspect find and crimb the ladder which I have he say so! He said, Mother, if you give time lower the rope so I would go into He said, why did he do such a cruel thing your disciples? He said, otherwise if you will never come up You go on forgiving and I was really surprised that how could I can only them everything free, you give them put before them Sol am Guru, give them the ladder to climb up. It is they who should work very hard, it is they who should introspect, it is they who should everything so easily, they will never value their self realisation I said, it's not so. You have to give them a chance, you have find out. Why should I help them to such an extent that you open their Agnya. I said, alright, you allow me to open his What she does? She sprouts the seeds, Agnya, if you don't mind He said, you then the trees come up then after that she are a Mother. do what you like! I have Hives them the fruits and she sees that the to allow them to rise and to allow them to become something like Mother Earth. nothing to say: if you want to do that, fruits are ripened She does all that but they are no trees you see, they are human beings and they have freedom to become devils also. I said, alright, if they are devils 1 can manage them. You just see how I you will spoil them. you spoil them Let him do at his own otherwise you will be spoiling him. I said, as you are also spoiled that you don't open anybody's Agnya, yes, but whatever position I have achieved is a permanent one So, 1 opened his can manage them. If they are devils they will remain devils. You cannot change Agnya. them. So, he argued with me and when he met Sahaja Yogis, he asked them how Then this fellow on his way told me

 Jan - Feb. 1999: 32 Volume XI Issue 1& 2 The Divine Cool Breeze many of you are willing to give lives for Shri Mataji? Do you know what She has given you? They said, yes we do. So they came to me and told Mother he wanted doesn't have this pure desire, he has some other desires then absolutely useless. Like some people come to Sahaja Yoga, I have seen, they want to make a us to give life for you. I said, that's not name out of themselves, they become necessary. it's not necessary because he used to ask his disciples perhaps great masters of everything, they want to dominate everything. That is not I met many like him who were very important. There are some people who strict Gurus, complete obedience was try to make money in Sahaja Yoga, a way needed, complete humility, complete of making money, that also absolutely low wrong and not only that but, is very level that they want to make money out of Sahaja Yoga Then there are people who just come here for some politics surrender was needed A word against Guru was not tolerated but even you could not answer, you could not show any tamper to a Guru. Now, I have met They go on saying things here and saying things there. All these things are not going to give you any ascent, what so ever. You people who are like that, sometimes. Then stopped talking to them, that's it If they want to improve they can improve, if they don't want to improve you cannot force them to improve but according to these Gurus there should be a great fear in their mind that they should be so frightened that they should behave themselves. have come here only to achieve a great life of spirituality, of becoming a Guru. Now, also this politics business is quite a lot. People try to enjoy the position of a leader. So, they try to keep that position in a very special way There's no need. If Now, we expect so much from the Guru that he is your father, mother. he is your friend everything. He is a pure you are a leader because you are a great s master, you will remain. Nobody can challenge you, nobody can throw you and person who just wants your ascent, we wants to look after you, he wants to guide such fear Sahaja Yoga is a yoga in which you, wants to protect you and takes you fear doesn't play any part. There's no fear to the life of spirituality and this is the way a Guru has to work out but wliat is expected of the disciple is even much worse The disciple has to be absolutely a pure person He should have a pure doing. Are you an absolutely a humble desire to become a spiritual person, If he person? Do you do whatever is told to one should not get disturbed with any for you. Only thing for your ascent, it is necessary that you introspect Try to find out what you have been

 Jan - Feb. 1999 33 XI Issue 1& 2 Volurme The Divine Cool Breeze you? Supposing. I tell somebody just go them will become speedy. Everybody starts running scattered Why? I am to, say some place He may not go, will come and tell me, Mother, you know this going, you are not going but it happens. Like that if you tell somebody that you have to go to a function or for some felicitation, people start jumping and that's a very modern disease, it was happened, that happened, some excuse, he may not go but that's not being good. If you have been told to go to that place. about there must be some meaning and you have not before So, they start seeing that we are getting late, getting upset but if you to go. You have to obey if you are not obedient then vou cannot become a Guru go. on worrying like that you don't go beyond time and when you go beyond time, you control time Time is with you, all the time Wherever you go, it happens. hecause if you can not obey, how can, others obey you? This obedience is not for any personal gain of Guru, not at all but for your gain only. for your education, for your ascent. So, if such a view is taken then what happens that you start getting all the qualities of a Guru I will give you an example of that. We had a little girl in Cabella who fell down and she broke her hand very badly. I was about to leave for America. I had come out of my room. When I saw the child I said, alright, doesn't matter I will cure Firstly, a Guru cannot be a fitssy man, first and foremost thing I want this house, I want that thing, I can't like this, I can't this child first. They said, no Mother, but like that. If a person who doesn't know your plane. I said, it's alright, forget it. how to get detached from all these habits, So, I got the child, treated the child and she w√§s alright and after I think half an hour I left for the airport and you will be amazed to hear that, that aeroplane was out of order which was going to New York. So, this plane is out of order then they said, alright you can go by another plane which goes to Washington with the same ticket. I said, very good idea, give me that and I went by that so that i reached Washington which is a very-very nice airport to arrive because there's no problem of customs, there's no crowd, he cannot be a Guru. How can he ascend? Of course, I mean you have to try that you get rid of all these habits. They are funny habits which make you miserable. doesn't make others miserable, as it makes you miserable No habit should cling to a GurI First and foremost is that he has to be beyond time. He should not worry about time. Many a times I have seen people if they have to go to airport for example, something enters into their body They become speedy suddenly, even if I have to go. I am going and all of

 Jan - Feb. 1999 34 Volume XI ISue : 1&2 The Divine Cool Breeze nothing All people go to New York. I jumping and he creates problems for don't know why? They should all go to himself and his family. Washington, it's very surprising. I discovered for myself that I wish I had Then the left sided is a person, which we call as the Tamoguni. The right side not gone by that horrible plane to go to is Rajoguna and the left side is one which is Tamoguna "Tamo' means darkness New York. Like that everything works out and the times come what is good for Such a man is afraid of darkness, but he you becomes a very intriguingly, very crooked person. He always tries to trouble people in a very crooked manner, not openly, while the right sided man is openly a It is such a lot of experience of mine which I can tell you that to worry about time itselfis a headache. If you leave it to this divine power and believe it then Hitler but this one, the second one, the one we call as Tamoguni is the one who tries to trouble others very well. Rajoguni has a opinion of his own about everything. He goes on forcing it on to others, other person but if you see his own life he is in complete misery. He cannot carry on with people, cannot talk with people and there's a very big gap between himself, his spirit and his being. everything works out for your good and if it does not, you must know that it is your testing. You must accept, you must learn to accept because whatever you have fixed up for yourself as something very great is not. So, what is the greatest thing you have to achieve, your detachment then you become Gunateeta means, as you know we have three gunas within us. One is, that's called as The second type the Tamogunis are Satvaguna, is the best but there are two the ones who end up with all kind of other gunas which are as you know that left sided and right side. Either you are a right sided person or a left sided person, These two gunas within us are of no importance. Supposing, you are a right sided person. Then what happens to you, you become overactive. Overactivity gives you fatigue, gives you all kinos of diseases which you have seen and you have to cure right side. Such a person is extremely speedy, he cannot sit in one place for two minutes, is all the time diseases. Even the right sided people get lot of diseases but the left ones get pshychosomatic Psychosomatic diseases are very dangerous and not curable by human doctors. So, you have to take to Sahaja Yoga but again you go to the right or to the left. This is not a very good attitude, I think, towards life that you get bound by one of these gunas or you are all the time like a pendulum moving from left to right, right to left. So, you have to

 Jan - Feb. 1999 35 Volume XI Isue 1& 2 The Divine Cool Breeze be a steady person. For that you all have to meditate. I know immediately a person who meditates and I know, who does not meditate. You will yourself know a another generation is there which is of no use. I met some of them when I was in Haridwar and I told them what are you doing here in the Himalayas? They said, person who meditates It's a question of we don't want to face human beings. They 10-15 minutes but that you must do every are useless people, they are good for night and moming about five minutes nothing. You do anything for them they meditation, then you develop your go on troubling you, we don't want to be balance, you devel≈Çop your tenacity, you develop your body in such a manner that become Guru? If you cannot manage it can stand lots of nonsense It can bear them, if you cannot get out the troubles with them. So, I said, why have you lots of things. Then you are not left with desires, what food should you eat? When they are giving you and out of all those things and remain in your peace then what's the use of becoming a Guru? He said we have had enough of it. Some of you should eat? Whom you should please? Nothing of the kind. You yourself of age and all them were over 100 years that but I said, what't the use? Your life is of no use, you are staying here alone somewhere in the Jungles. He said, the become such a sweet person that everybody is pleased and understands that one has to be like you. The people see you and you become like a model. People tigers, the snakes all of them know us that start following vou. that means you become a Guru In this way you get rid of these two habits that you have of left and right side. we are great, they don't trouble us but these human beings torture us, we don't want to go there because they are very ambitious or they are very negative. Something is wrong with the human beings. None of them have reached a perfect state. So. I was surprised how they are not at all willing to come down and be with us and be a part and parcel of us. They said, alright Mother, you have Now. Satvagunis are the people who believe in the rightousness but when they are righteous they contempt for others who are not righteous. They go on saying things to such people so, they can develop a kind of temperament so they become aloof. They can ge to Himalayas sit there come, you are a Mother, you can tolerate all this and you can work it out but not we We are out of it, we don't want to go and not meet anybody Get out of the society, get out of all your relations back. everyone and just establish yourself as a big Guru somewhere This kind of They have lots of power, they can

 36 Jan - Fab 1999 Volumie XI Issue 1& 2 The Divine Cool Breeze control the nature, they can do so many you? What is the wrong path you are taking? Overnight you have seen people give up but still there are many. I should say, subtle things, we stick on to them. First thing that happens to you is that you start finding what's wrong with your own people, of your own nation. things but they said, its easy to control a snake than to control a human being. Today they might behave in a particular manner, suddenly they will become horrible. You don't know these human beings. how uncertain they are What uncertain quality they have. I said, there is a way of putting them right. First give them realisation. In the light of the spirit they can see how they are doing wrong I am amazed you see when the English got realisation they started telling me about the English, when Italians got realisation they started telling me about the Italians. If you tell Italians that this Italian fellow did this he said, Italians after all Mother, what will they do! They are things. 99% people will know what's going wrong with them, where are they missing the point! They will start seeing themselves. just like this you know. He himself is an Italian but immediately he said. Same with Spirit is like a mirror where you see yourself clearly and you start changing the Russians I have seen, it's very yourself There's no introspection needed surprising that they start telling you about when you have your spirit awakened You what's wrong with the Russians. All of can watch yourself, you can see for them are quite alike. Even Indians, they yourself clearly as soon as you become a developed or evolved Sahaja Yogi and They are Indian people Mother, they are that is one point one should see if it has doing like this. I was surprised that they happened. If you can see something themselves being Indians also how are with you, if you can find out what they immediately telling me about the sorts of defects you have, if you can Indians. Many things I have come to detach yourself from those defects and if know about these countries, actually will say, after all this is Indian, you know. wrong you can understand that all these through the Sahaja Yogis only. When the attachments and defects and habits are Sahaja Yogis tell me. I am amazed that pulling you down then only you can leave them but that only happens when you have this mirror of yourself shining through When this light comes to you, you see for yourself, what is wrong with they are not identified with their country, they are not identified with anyone, even their own family they are not identified. If they find something wrong, they will tell me Mother, my father is like that, my

 Jan - Feb. 1999 37 Volume Xi issue: 1&2 The Divine Cool Breeze these things that you can see and that is mother is like that IS how you can save others who are getting drowned into the ocean of darkness, into That is how you get detached when you start seeing and are not identified If the ocean of misidentification, only when you are above all this but mostly what happens is this that you are identified. You you are not identified with all these things then you become a free person, you have the freedom, you become a person who are identified how can I do it? How can I is not attached to anyone because he is father or she is your mother or a save? your sister or anyone This attachment is a very The countries where Sahaja Yoga has spread where there have been people who are not identified with those countries and dangerous one also. With the family attachment we have lost many Sahaja Yogis because their family was funny, they got lost. They coundn't get out of it. We think that they have to help all these countrymen to come up, to join in. For that tremendous patience and love is necessary. As you know this cosmic power as they call it, they say, I am the source, Actually, it is the power of love of divine, and such a love doesn't demand anything, doesn't want anything but it acts, it works For example, if you love somebody you would not like to do something to displease that person. Of course there are some Sahaja Yogis who do things which 1 really don't like but I never show I just keep quiet but normally don't say that you detach yourself from your family or get out of it but in a subtle way you should understand what are they up to? And what they are doing? All these subtle understanding about everyone doesn't give you any right also to criticise them. You should see for yourself what's wrong with you? You know all these subtleties, you criticise such a person is such but you also have the same problems with you. That's why you get detachment only possible through this introspection through the mirror of your spirit if a person has love for someone he wouldn't do anything to displease or to trouble that person or in anyway hurt. So, the spiritual life is very important to a person than anything else on this Without that development within you, Earth because such a person has been seeking. He has been seeking the truth, he has been seeking the reality and once you cannot become collective. In collectivity what happens is that you feel for others. You understand others You may not show off but inside yourself you know Supposing, somebody you know the reality you don't want to cling on to something which is not reality. You want to be a p√©rson who is above all

 Feb 1999 38 Volume XI issue: 182 Jan The Divine Cool Breeze achieving a great state of spirituality, such people are to be helped at any cost. I know some of them have gone to very has done lots of funny things with you, doesn't matter but gradually you will see he will change, gradually he will become better because he realises that whatever he has been doing, has not been a correct thing to do. He will not only feel guilty, that's not the way but he will say I should correet. Why did I do like this? I should not have done. Gradually he will improve wrong gurus and they have suffered. They have a bad Agnya, they have all kinds of things, doesn't matter. You should try to help them. If they can listen to you, if they can understand what you are telling them I'm sure it would work out. It is worked but for that you should have a great sense out so much as you can see that in the of forgiveness, great sense of foreign countries where I was just an understanding. Under circumstances Indian, how people have taken it, how people also misbehave because they had they have understood me and how they no training how to be alright? None to be have become Sahaja Yogis of such a great humble? They misbehave because in their value and level. culture perhaps there is nothing but just We never had so many saints in the anger and arTogance and it is regarded something great Also they misbehave, olden days, never Only one saint would sometimes as they come from such be born and he would be tortured. There families where only arrogance is taught So, you can't help. Such people are to be forgiven again and again and see that they change because I have a faith that all collective? How to be nice to each other? human beings can be made into beautiful Because later on when you become the flowers of fragrance, all the human beings Guru, when you have to guide the people, but I know there are some difficult ones you will know what are the problems of Why? because they don't want. If they don't want, if they don't have the pure collectivity perfect and once you learn were not so many to help each other and to protect each other. So collectivity is to be learnt very well. How to be the collectivity. Also, you will know how to overcome that. How to make desire, you cannot force it on them. that thing, you will be amazed that you have mastered the art of being a Guru. So, forget it They are difficult peorle, forget about them but those who want, I would like to see so many of you those who have a great desire which is absolutely pure Desire not for money, not becoming a real Guru, real masters not only in your jobs, in your talents but in. for position, not for anything but for your own life. People should say that such

 Jan - Feb 1999 Volume: XI IssuO : 1&2 The Divine Cool Breeze absurd the way sometimes I find some and such person is a real Guru. For that as I said, you must learn obedience, complete obedience Should not question Sahaja Yogis are so anxious to assert themselves as leaders. It's not correct. the guru Whatever is told to you, you So many times I have explained to must do. Though in Sahaja Yoga I do not say that. Today is the first time I am saying it because I find so many of you you that your own development, your own correction, your own position in Sahaja Yoga will say what you are! fall a little short of becoming perfect. You don't have to sacrifice anything, I have told you. You don't have to give up Whatever others may say doesn't matter What you say about yourself is the reality and you must face yourself for that 1 families or anything and do odd things would say specially for the ladies. Fm a just to show that you are perfect But it's woman and I have worked very hard all something, a state within yourself, which these years and as a woman I must tell you have to establish, where you become you that all the ladies should try because extremely humble, obedient and you will they always say we are shaktis but in their be growing with this light, 1 am sure. Once you understand the importance then you life I don't see there's any work done as shaktis, Only they are sort of dependants all the time on Sahaja Yoga They have will dedicate yourself to become a personality of a rare quality. It's the to stand up in their own freedom, they easiest thing to be because that's the most have to be independent and they should comfortable way of living in life. No use fighting, no use quarrelling, no use trying to show off and all that. The care of have right ideas about everything I'm sure if the ladies come up that way, our Sahaja Yoga will spread very much. Men are working much more for Sahaja Yoga than women are I can understand everyone, the suggestion of care is very much satisfying for others. Little care here and there People like it and that only because they have families, they have children, this, that but the most important comes from a very noble soul who bothers thing is that once you take to active Sahaja Yoga then your children also come about small small things, about whatever others need. It's not for your own up well, the families are also looked after advancement, it's not for your own sort After all there is this divine power which looks after all of you. You must believe that this divine power, thinks, uƒ±nderstands, it organises. Above all, it of leadership whatever you may call or for your own positions but it's for your own ascent, for your higher life that you give up all these ideas of leadership It's

 40 Jan-Feb. 199g Volume XI Issue : 1&2 The Divine Cool Breeze understanding about spreading Sahaja Yoga All of you should put your mind to it If women can't go out, they can loves you. This divine power has to be understood that it is now your own and that you are in the realm of this divine power where you won't have any write down something, they can write problems, whatsoever. If you leave things about their spiritual ascent or about to the divine power, it will all work out. As you know about the scientist who whatever their experiences are So, in any case all those who have got miraculous found out about me. I have to just say photographs, they should send it over that he asked me that how is it this that here, This gentleman is coming here in September and he is going to analyse all of them. So, it would be very nice of you if you can send it. Also, you write down so many hearts are made here? I said people were singing the song, "Sitting in the heart of the Universe' so, this many hearts have come up but he said, still does have about your different experiences you had in Sahaja Yoga That will be also a good idea. He told me that he would like this power hear? I said, no. It's me only 1 can hear I was hearing the song and then to publish a book, and now the time has come for us to publish our miracles that have taken place. All of you have had that power organises everything It's something to be understood very well that the power within you, what you have. Lunderstands and understands you also. It some experiences or miracle. So I have to request you to send it as soon as possible, written well in English language or in Hindi language or Marathi because way of power which is your own IS power but you cannot control it. It knows about you wherever you are falling, when you are doing wrong, the same power I don't understand other languages protects you and loves you, like a Mother please don't send me in other languages. it will correct you and bring you to the We will have to appoint somebody to translate in 14 languages, typical thing. and right path So. I would request you to send that. I'm I think now a new century is starting and so many things have to happen and sure today's lecture you will again go ill of you must decide that you will do this or that whatever is your through it and understand it and work it out May God Bless You!!!

 "Once you start doing God's work, God does your work and that's how you will be amazed how you get so much time to do the right thing."
