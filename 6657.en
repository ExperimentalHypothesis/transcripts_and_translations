House in Pratishthan, Pune (India)
Talk Language: English | Transcript (English) – Draft

I must say that this beautiful Earth has created so many beautiful things. But She Herself is nothing but detached, simple Mother Earth. Perhaps that’s My condition, too. When it comes to creation I can create beautiful things. You are so beautiful, too, creatures. But as far as I am concerned I do not think that I require any one of these things or I’m bothered about them, or need them or tempted by them. So what Grégoire has said is because they are insisting that they are going to give Me presents every year and that’s why this is a delude to them. But I’ve been telling them that there’s no need now. Let’s say, you all consider it, is only no need to give so many presents. What you can do now to start reducing the number of presents you give Me. One country can give one present. If you can do that I’ll be thankful, but I’ll have to build another house. And the grandeur and all these things are created by Me but never enjoyed by Me. I just enjoy Myself; that’s all. And Myself is so big, it is such a big thing, that I don’t know what it means; it means grandeur, or nature, or anything, or you all people. I enjoy everything of it.

So for Me there’s no need for you to. Now as he said that those people came, three of them ? Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha ? to give presents to Christ. Yes, they did. And you have given Me, too. But now I think it’s better that you people reduce some quantity at least. I’ll be very thankful that if something could be done like that, and from next year we should try to make it less and less and less. Because it’s very sweet of you to have given Me all those things, because I enjoyed them, they are beautiful things, and when I see them I remember your good heart. But you know that Mother is too simple and though I can create all kinds of things, as far as I am concerned I am too simple. And also Mr. Shrivastava so many times, says also, “You’ve got so many saris but you’ll go on with Your white sari all the time.” The reason is, you see, a simple personality can only create beautiful things. A simple heart can only create nice things, because simplicity at the simple level is so simple. Like you are made of seven chakras, seven chakras, then the permutations of these seven chakras, that’s all. But supposing you start from outside then you’ll have to go to medical science or you’ll have to go to another complicated thing. But basically, fundamentally, it’s too simple. That’s why Sahaja Yoga is very simple, because we are dealing with the fundamental things. So fundamentally, if you are simple then everything that you do is just a combination and permutation of all these things, and all these things when they are put together they make such beautiful things.

For example, as I have told you once I was travelling and we went to a place called Palitana known to be a very beautiful, beautifully carved place. And we had to walk, I don’t know, for three miles at least, climbing up or something like that. With Me was My daughter and My son-in-law. Went up and there was a little temple. They wanted to rest. And also we laid down ourselves there. And as soon as I saw all these beautiful elephants were there, so I told My son-in-law, “Look at these elephants. All their tails are twisted differently.” He said, “Mummy, we are so fed up. How do you have energy to see the tails?” I said, “Because I see the tails I don’t feel tired. That’s the point. Because I see the beauty of these tails, I — ”. So you see, even in simple things there is so much of beauty. In very, very ordinary persons you’ll find that they have a very beautiful things and very nice way of saying things, very simple talks of children like that, it’s so simple, so straightforward, and whatever they say it’s so deep. So whatever is deep is simple, but when it is expressed outside it can have lots of permutations and combinations and it can work out in a beautiful way.

I must tell you, I had no strain in making this house, nothing. I was not bothered at all. I found everything so easily; I brought it here, put it down here, I never even thought there’s strain or anything. Everybody says, “What a concept.” But I never conceived anything. I mean, I just don’t know. What is a concept is there; I just told, “To Me is nothing great.” The whole world is there for us to see and to be fascinated. But behind all that, all this world and everything is created with the very little, simple idea of God, that you all have to enter into the Kingdom of God. That’s all; such a simple idea. So He’s created such a beautiful world, then he created all kinds of things to bring you to the human level, and now just simple thing is to enter into the Kingdom of God. You should not complicate yourself too much and once you do that you will be surprised how beautifully you will be able to produce.

Even some artists were extremely simple by nature. Like Ravi Shankar, you know, and his guru, he has got Alla Raka and Ali Akbar; all these were his disciples. Such a great genius man, such a simple man, I tell you. And he knew Me very well. He used to call Me “Ma”; he used to call Me “Mother” from the very beginning. And one day he brought one little deer, a baby deer, brought it to Me. I said, “What’s the matter?” He said, “See, this deer was crying too much. So I brought it to You.” But I said, “For, why for Me?” “So, You see, he will feel the love of his Mother. So You just caress him.” Imagine, such a great artist coming like a little baby to Me, making that. I was so surprised at him. Look at him; such a simple man. He’s doing that. And you see, if you see the children when they love, how genuine they are, how they work it out.

The same place there was a child. He was very fond of Me. And one day he decided to bring some pumpkins for Me. So he brought one to Me. I saw him bringing in the thing. He said, “All right, just wait.” Then there was, he went back, and there was another one kept little further. He brought that. He had put nine of them in different places. One by one he was bringing them. He brought nine pumpkins to give Me. So sweet. But I said, “Why did you bring nine?” “Because I don’t know which one you like so I brought all of them.” So simple and so touching; I mean, just [touch/touches/tears/turns] your heart.

So we have to be simple people. We have to talk to each other in a simple way, not in a complicated way, in a very simple, sweet manner. That’s how we are going to create a beautiful world. So I would request all of you to be very kindly and very gentle with each other, especially for the newly marrying couples. Try to be nice. Nobody is going to dominate you if you are nice. It’s only you dominate yourself. And don’t try to control your husbands or your wives. Let them be. Let them enjoy their freedom. They are not going to do anything wrong. So some people try to control too much and there are problems. So please do not try to control like, “If I am keeping it here, they’ll keep it there.” There’s no need. Let it be. Doesn’t matter; nothing so serious. But on small, small things, I’ve seen, such marriages fizzle out. And it is absolutely wrong. So for marriages today, it’s a very auspicious day. So many people have been engaged to be married. But one thing you must remember, that you should not lose your connection with joy. It’s stupidity. When two nice birds are together they should chirp and laugh and enjoy. Instead of that, if they start pricking each other, what should we call them?

So today it’s a great joy for Me. So many people are engaged and are going to get married. But now, understand your responsibility that nothing is to be done. You have to be just sahaj; don’t have to do anything. “We are working out.” You cannot work out marriage; you cannot work out. Just know about your husband or about your wife and just try to enjoy whatever they are. I mean, I do enjoy that way about My husband, so many things which may sound little queer to people, but I enjoy it. Because I know that’s a nice thing about our human beings that they have varieties and they have little, different angles to themselves. And these angles are to be enjoyed and to be appreciated. If you can do that, then you will never fight. Because two persons cannot be alike; even two leaves are not alike. So you should enjoy. Everybody has some sort of a super quality thing or whatever it is or maybe some angle. Just enjoy that angle. You don’t have that; so let him have at least, or let her have that. So today, special day is that so many marriages have been fixed out. I don’t know how many ? he has not told Me yet the number ? but quite a lot have been fixed.

Sahaja yogi: Fifty.

Shri Mataji: Fifty have been already fixed. All right. So now it’s a very big number and will be more by the time we reach Ganapatipule. So let us not create problems out of this. You don’t have to sit down. I have seen after marriage they start thinking, “What, what do you think about him?” It’s like after realization you start thinking. Once you are married, you are not to think then accept. Before marriage you think. What’s the use of thinking after marriage? It’s a very common thing. After marriage they start thinking. Then, after marriage you enjoy. After cooking the food you eat the food. Or after the food has been served then you start thinking about it. It’s absurd. So this is a very common failing we have had so far. I would like to tell you first of all, you think before getting married and after getting married you carry on. And don’t try to control. Don’t try to dictate. Try to be nice and sweet. You don’t have to go out of the way, but be normal and it will all work out. May God bless you all, specially all the girls and boys who have been engaged.

I bless you from My heart, and enjoy each other; that’s the main point.
So thank you very much. Thank you.
