[..] We cannot change it.  We cannot transform it.  We cannot [CAPITALIZE OR CONCEPTUALIZE?] it.  We have to know it on our central nervous system.  This is what is described in Sanskrit language as Budh or they call it [BODH] from which the word "Buddha", means enlightened personality.  Also, its called as [Veeda?] from where the word Vedas  come from.  Also, the word "Gna" as "GN" used in Sanskrit language means the knowledge - means the absolute knowledge.  The same word again was used in the talk of Gnostics.  These were the people who knew the absolute knowledge long time back.  John's Revelation is a very beautiful book which is much more than what it is in the Bible. And he has talked about the Gnostics who lived in those days and were tortured by the people who were supposed to be in charge of religion.  So this is the knowledge we are talking about [our ascent? In the Zen? Sahaj?] [UNCLEAR PHRASE] and our inner being.  We have to realize that our Creator was the greatest organizer and the centers that you see here, the seven centers were created within us during our evolutionary process.  These centers are formed by the left and right side of the sympathetic nervous system like this, forming the central part which is described as [UNCLEAR WORD].  We have in our triangular bone, the sacrum, the power which we call as Kundalini, which is coiled three and a half coils.  And this Kundalini is the power of pure desire within us.  All other desires are not pure.  According to economics desires in general are not [satiable - satisfied?].  You take to one desire, you want to have say a house, when you get it, you are not satisfied, you want to have a car.  But when you get even your car you are not satisfied. Like this we go on jumping from one desire to another desire.  That means, we are not satisfied with any desire which is fulfilled.  But we have within us, dormantly placed, the pure desire which is the power lies in the sacrum bone.  That means that Greeks knew that it is sacred bone, because they called it sacrum.  Now when we are sometimes fed up in life or are born with this pure desire of seeking the truth, then this power can be awakened.  It passes through six centers and the seventh center is below the sacrum bone.  This seventh center looks after our excretions, that is also sex.  So for the awakening of the Kundalini, this center stops its activities and supports the awakening of the Kundalini, that shows, that means that sex has nothing to do with the awakening of the Kundalini.  When the Kundalini is rising, you become like a child, and when you become like a child, you become very innocent.  That's why Christ has said, "You have to be like children to enter into the Kingdom of God."


Now to tell you about the seven chakras will take too much time and when you come to our centers, you will know all about it.  Thomas told me that he just talked about Me and nothing about chakras.  Doesn't matter.  I want to just tell you that when this Kundalini rises and passes through these centers, it nourishes them, she nourishes and also she pierces through the seventh center here, or we can call the first center in the fontanel bone area and becomes one with the all pervading power of divine love.  So the truth is that you are not this body, this mind, this ego, this emotions, intellect, but you are pure spririt.  And the second truth is that when we see these flowers, we take them for granted.  But how they have come out like this, it's a miracle.  We never even think who does this miraculous things.  If you ask a doctor, "Who runs our heart?", he will say "It is the autonomous nervous system."  But who is this auto?  This is done by this all pervading divine power.  All the living processes are done by this divine power.  Also, our evolutionary process are done by this great power of divine love.


So, now, we are at a point where we have to move little further to achieve our Self-Realization.  Science does not know why we are on this earth, it cannot answer many questions.  But when the Kundalini rises and connects you with this pervading power, you start feeling this power within yourself.  You start feeling the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.  Holy Ghost is nothing but this all pervading power.  And this power is the power of the Primordial Mother.  It is very surprising that, in the Bible, they have a Father and a Son but not the Mother.  It may be because of Paul. Because he never met Christ and also he was never given any initiation by Christ.  And he hated women. So he called it a Holy Ghost How can there be a ghost?.  This is how we have such a big problem today that they cannot think a woman can become the priest.  But according to Indian scriptures which is very ancient, a woman is the power, is the Shakti.  And this Kundalini is your individual Mother power, because She is your own and She knows each and everything about you.  She is full of intelligence, understanding and the greatest thing is that She loves you.  And She is very anxious to give you the Self-hood, that is Self-Realization.  Christ has said, "You have to be born again." And She is the Mother who gives you your second birth.  So [this is all destined?].  And it is now working in 65 nations in a big way.  This knowledge was not only known to Indians, but also to [UNCLEAR WORD] and also to [John?].  It was restricted knowledge and only one master would have only one disciple.  But this is a special time.  I call it a blossom time when there are so many flowers who are seeking and they are about to become fruits.  But, definitely there is going to be a judgment, final judgment, this is the time of that judgment.  You have to decide whether you want to choose the truth or falsehood.  By just believing that I know that truth, you don't know the truth.


So when this Kundalini rises, the first thing that happens to you is that you start feeling the cool breeze of this power on your finger tips.  Now there are five, six and seven centers on the left side and same way seven centers on the right side.  Now each centers, you can feel them on your finger tips.  In the Quran, it is said, "At the time resurrection, that is Kiyama, your hands will speak." And there will be witness against [UNCLEAR WORD].  This is the time of Kiyama, of resurrection.  I don't know from where this idea of resurrection came among Jews and Muslims and Christians, that if you bury yourself, your dead bodies will come out after five, six hundred years and then you get resurrection.  For five, six hundred years, if a body lies in the grave, what will come out?  It should be logical.  That's not reality.  But according to the Indian scriptures, it is much more sensible where it says that your souls [will take birth] and you will have population [control which is a fact].  At that time, the people who were seeking God in the [UNCLEAR WORD] and mountains will be born and [UNCLEAR WORD] and they will find their realization.  It sounds sensible to Me.  So the souls which were [sick?] are born again.  William Blake has said, "Men of God will be born in those days."  Hundred years back, he said so, hundred years back and they will find divinity in themselves.  When they have this divinity, then they will be able to give it to others.  This is exactly what happens in Sahaja Yoga.  You feel from your fontanel area, a cool breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area.  That is the actualization of baptism.  It is not that somebody puts water on your head and you are baptized, it is artificial. 


 In Russia, they make the naked women to get into water for their realization.  Everything should be logical isn't it?  Can't understand this kind of a nonsense by making them naked, I don't know what they achieve. In Sahaja yoga, you don't have to give up anything.  You don't have to go Himalayas and stand on your heads.  It is something that is internal which works out.  It has nothing to do with these outward things. Like Kabira has said, because some people shave their heads. He said, "By shaving your heads if you are going to go to heaven, then what about the sheep, they are shaven everyday."  All kinds of absurd things they did.  Last time, when I  was here in Basel where five, six boys from one group somebody and they are just chanting like mad.  They wouldn't listen to anything, they didn't want anything, it was like mad, you know what, they were hypnotized or what I don't know, they were chanting.  All kinds of stupid ideas have come out in these modern times of Kali Yuga which I can't believe how people digest it.  For example, the same people getting you jump in a range three feet high, what is the necessity?  And so many people broke their bottoms and they became bankrupt.  Every time they are starting a new marketing.  In India, they cannot work out because they are too wise to take to such nonsensical thing.  As such we have traffic jam, what is the need to be on three feet height floating about, I can't understand.  All kinds of nonsensical [UNCLEAR WORD] in the name of God.  They are not afraid of God, [UNCLEAR WORD].  Money making is the main proposition. Even the religions are money oriented or power oriented.  They have lost their brains I tell you.


We have to understand, what do we get by doing any kind of yoga or transcendental or any nonsense, what do we get.  We start [UNCLEAR WORD].   America is the stupidest, I must say.  There is one fellow who has come from TM marketing and he says "All right, I can teach you now how to control other people's mind."  So he called somebody from the audience [UNCLEAR WORD] with pendulum in his hand.  He hypnotizes, I think and he said now move the pendulum and he goes on moving the pendulum.  Why I am telling you, because, so many of them started telling Me, "What sort of Indians there are, they told us to move the pendulum, we lost all our money, houses, children are taken [out of?] the school."  [UNCLEAR WORD] stupid people.  Have you come on this earth to move a pendulum? What is your worth?  What is your value?


Another one is Dalai Lama.  He went to Canada and half of those people now have only one cloth left with them.  He is the greatest beggar ever known.  He just accumulating gold there, what is the need to give him so much money?  And so many are there like this in this world, specially in your country I am surprised they are all here [] Switzerland.  You have to see the disciples and find the truth.  You cannot wait for divine to come.  It is invaluable.  Try to think, that how much did you pay to the Mother earth for these flowers?  You cannot sell God in the market.  Once you realize this, then you are safe in Sahaja Yoga.  Those, who are real seekers will find the ultimate truth.  But you have to be honest and you have to be intelligent.  Sahaja Yoga is not meant for idiots.


Frankly try to understand, why are you on this earth? Sahaja -  "Saha" means with, with you is born the light, to have this union with the all pervading power.   This is your right and you can't pay.  When you realize what you are, what is your glory, what is your beauty, on your finger tips you will know the absolute truth.  On your finger tips, you will know about your own centers.  On your finger tips, you will know the centers of others.  So who is the other?  When a drop becomes a ocean, who is the other drop?  When a microcosm becomes macrocosm, where is your identity but the whole universe?  I can tell you that you have so many powers within you which are not yet discussed.  With this happening, your brain opens, your heart opens and you start becoming a great creative personality.  Our health problems also comes to us of this centers.  So many people have been cured by Sahaja Yoga.  By your own power. For diagnosis if you have to go toAmerica be careful, half of your time will be finished and half of your energy will be finished.  But in Sahaja Yoga you don't even take even two minutes to say what's wrong with you.  You can feel it on your finger tips, only thing you should know how to correct those centers.  That's all, you can cure yourself.


And you are so much full of dynamic energy that you don't feel tired.  Can you imagine I am seventy-one year old woman and I traveled [UNCLEAR WORD].  When somebody says "You are traveling", I say, "I don't think I am traveling, I am just sitting in the aeroplane, what is there?" Because you enter into the realm which we call as thoughtless awareness. They are all the time thinking of the future or the past, we cannot be in the present.  We are jumping on the thoughts of future and the past, but in between lies the present.  So when Kundalini rises she separates the thoughts and your attention now is in thoughtless awareness in the present. All your stress disappears, all your worries disappear and you see all your problems, you see clearly.  Like you are in the water, you are afraid of the waves, but if you get on top of the boat, then you can see all the waves.  But if you know how to swim you can save others.  This is the state where you are absolutely at peace with yourself, at peace with everyone.  This state exists within us.  I have known many people who have got peace awards, but they are so hot tempered, that you better reach them with [UNCLEAR WORD].  I don't know why they create this peace award and how.  Peace within us, and unless and until we achieve that state of peace, how are we going to stretch peace within all?


When you get your self realization, you become the Spirit.  And your attention is enlightened by that spirit.  You become a witness of the whole world like a drama.  This enlightened attention is a very powerful means of spreading divine vibrations. You see eyes of such person becomes innocent, absolutely innocent.  We have to know that there is one thing that is our innocence which never destroy.  It is covered with clouds [maybe with our will?], but never destroyed.  And you regain that back your innocent state within yourself.  At the same time you are so dynamic but you become extremely compassionate.  You don't have fears, You don't have any grudges, you are absolutely floating in the beautiful atmosphere of truth.  If you have read the Bible, [ Mathews - Delete] the first chapter of Mathews this is what they have described [Christ has described?], where He says that "Thou shall not have adulterous eyes."  You become so [UNCLEAR WORD] and at the same time, extremely innocent. You don't have to [accept?], your own personality becomes [UNCLEAR WORD].  Then the greatest thing that happens to you is that you jump into the ocean of joy.  Now joy [UNCLEAR WORD], it is not like happiness or unhappiness.  When your ego is pampered, you are happy, when it is punctured, you are unhappy.  But the joy [UNCLEAR WORD].  It is a state which is to be experienced.  And you start using your vibrations and raising the Kundalini of others, because this power you get.  From the first stage of thoughtless awareness, you jump into another state called state called as doubtless awareness.  And a tremendous transformation takes place, you will be amazed, there are at least thirty percent of Sahaja yogis have been drug addicts, thirty percent.  And they gave up drugs overnight.  I never said, don't do, I never said. [Ten commandments I don't say].  Because half of them will go away.  But automatically, in the light of the spirit they just give up because you become your own guide.


I have told you that Sahaja Yoga is working in sixty five nations and so many of them come together in India.  They have become angels, they never quarrel, they never fight, no arguments.  Of course, they pull each other legs and have fun.  Their whole life becomes fun.  It is a fun actually and you just understand why.  Everything is happening that, because now we are entering into the age of truth.  Do you think our creator will allow us to destroy his own creation?  Is He not powerful enough to tell us and to give us that unique state which is required to us?


So then, please understand that you all can get your realization tonight, but you must have pure desire.  If Germans take to Sahaja yoga, the whole world can be transformed much more.  Because, they are the Germs, is the essence if they take to destruction they can destroy, if they take to construction they can construct. Its now the time for us to construct this world into a beautiful palace and show that it will appeal to you and you take your realization and you will go deep into it.  You are best in mechanism producing Mercedes and beautiful other things. Now you have to learn the mechanisms within ourselves  and the power of divine love.  I am sure, one day Germany will come forward very much. Though today I must say Russia is doing very well.  Surprising, seventy percent of Russian population, I never expected, the way they have reacted to Sahaja Yoga.  They were just like a clean slateand in one [  village only Kaliali?] we had twenty one thousand Sahaja yogis. I asked them why did you [UNCLEAR WORD] all the gurus and accepted Me. In a joke they said Mother we didn't have dollars. That's fine. 


In this short lecture whatever was possible I tried to cover but I have given you four thousand five thousand lectures in English language only. I would request you that you shouldn't worry about lectures so much. Because this is beyond your mental state. It will take hardly ten minutes to give self realization. If you have pure desire in that. But there are three conditions which I must tell you. First condition is that you must have full confidence in you that you will get your self realization. And that you should not feel guilty or condemn yourself for that at all. This guilt business is of the past. You have to be in the present. Why worry about the past? But this left hand center gets into trouble if you feel guilty. So we don't feel guilty. People don't like when I told them. Because they think it is religious to feel guilty. So you are not going to condemn yourself for anything. As I respect you , you should respect yourself, The second condition is even easy that you have to forgive everyone which is difficult for some. But again I will say logically. Whether you forgive or don't forgive what do you do? Nothing, its  myth. It's a myth.  But when you don't forgive you play into wrong hands. The one who has tortured you and troubled you is enjoying himself and you are [] yourself. But the worst part is that when you don't forgive you catch in a very constricted center inside your brain on the optic chasma. So if you have this center caught up with guilt then you get Angina or spondylitis. And at this moment if you still feel guilty how the Kundalini will pass through. Also in this center at this moment you should forgive because you have tortured yourself all you life and [UNCLEAR WORD] you are closing this center by not forgiving. So these are the two main conditions and the third one is even simpler that you have to take out your shoes. [UNCLEAR WORD] How we are going to nourish both the centers.


I have told you there are two powers, left and right. Left for your desire and right for action. So first you see we will show you. Put your left hand towards Me like this on your lap. This is symbolic that you desire to have your self realization. [You can remove the fan because people can't see properly - Delete] Now the right hand we are going to do for nourishing our centers which you don't have to do it again, only here. So please put your right hand on your heart. In the heart resides the spirit. If you become the spirit you become your own master. So please put your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. We are working only on the left hand side. You will be amazed to know that the pure knowledge of the Divine, the center is here in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. So we go upwards again on the upper portion of abdomen on the left hand side. Then we go on our heart. Then in the corner of our neck near shoulder and turn around towards right. I think there are people who are really feeling guilty [because this is catching very well]. Please don't feel guilty. If you have done anything wrong you would been in jail, So please respect yourself. All right, now take your right hand on top of your forehead across like this and put down your head. Now this is the center where we have to forgive everyone in general. Don't have to think also of them because [UNCLEAR WORD]. Now please take your right hand now to the back side of your head and push back your head slightly. This is the center without feeling guilty without counting your mistakes just for your satisfaction you have to ask first from the all pervading divine power. So now the last center, please stretch your palm. Now put the center of your palm on top of your fontanel bone area which was the soft bone in your childhood. Now stretch back your fingers. So very important, stretch back your fingers. Put pressure on your skull. Now please bend your head. Here you have to move your scalp with the pressure seven time clockwise [UNCLEAR WORD] Now that's all we have to do. 


But now we have to close our eyes. So you can take out your spectacles. Put both your feet apart from each other because these are two powers. Please put your left hands towards Me. And put your right hand on your heart. You can take out your spectacles and close your eyes and please don't open them until I say. Now please keep your eyes closed. Here on the center of heart you have to ask a fundamental question about yourself to Me in your heart. Here you have to ask, you can call me "Mother" or "Shri Mataji". Please ask three times "Mother, am I the spirit?". I have already told you that when you become the spirit you become your own master. The center of mastery is on the left side of your abdomen [UNCLEAR WORD] please put your right hand on the upper portion of the abdomen on the left hand side. Put your right hand. Here you have to ask another fundamental question to Me about yourself three times. Here you have to ask "Mother, am I my own master?" three times. 


I respect your freedom. I cannot force self realization on you. Also I cannot force the pure Divine knowledge on you, you have to ask for it. So please take your right hand to the lower portion of your abdomen and press it hard. Here you have to ask six times, because this center has got six petals. So please ask "Mother, please give pure divine knowledge". As soon as you ask the pure Divine knowledge, the Kundalini starts rising. But we have to nourish our center with our full self confidence the upper centers. For that, you raise your right hand to the upper portion of your abdomen on your left hand side and press it hard. Here you have to say with full self confidence ten times, "Mother I am my own master" I have already told you that you are not this body, this mind, this intellect, this emotions, this ego and your conditioning but you are the pure spirit. So please raise your hand on your heart and say with full confidence twelve times "Mother I am the pure spirit". 


This all pervading power of Divine love is the ocean of knowledge. It is the ocean of compassion and bliss. But above all it is the ocean of forgiveness. And whatever you take too much you must know it can be easily dissolved by this portion of forgiveness. So forgive yourself and put your right hand at the corner of your neck and shoulder and put your right hand, press and your head towards the right. Here you have to say again with full self confidence sixteen times "Mother, I am not guilty at all". I have already told you that whether you forgive or don't forgive you don't do anything. But if you don't forgive then you play into wrong hands and [UNCLEAR WORD]. At this moment forgive everyone because this center is very constricted. So raise your right hand on top of you forehead above and put down your head. Please put down your head and it say from your heart, "Mother I forgive everyone" without thinking about them in general. With from your heart not from [your tongue?]. Now without feeling guilty without counting your mistakes just for your satisfaction you have to ask forgiveness from the all pervading Divine power. So now please take the right hand left side and push back your head. Here again you have to say from your heart [not from your tongue?] "Oh divine power if I have done any mistakes knowingly or unknowingly please forgive me". Straight from your heart. Now the last center is very important. Please stretch your palm and put the center of your palm on top of your fontanel bone area. Here again I cannot force self realization on you, you have to ask for it. So here you bend your head stretch your fingers and put pressure on your scalp and move it seven times clockwise saying Mother please give me my self realization. Push back a little. It is important to push back and put gentle pressure. Please take down your hands. Put both your hand towards Me like this. Not like that, like this. Put it like this first. Without thinking, put your hands without thinking. Put both your hands like this. Now you see with your left hand bend your head see if there is a cool or hot breeze like vibrations are coming out of your fontanel bone area. Now please put your left towards Me bend your head and see with your right hand. If there is hot breeze is coming then please forgive. Don't put your hand on top of the head but away from it. Some people get it very far away. So move your hand and see for your self. You have to certify. Now raise the right hand. Now raise both your hands towards Me and push back your head. Here you have to ask anyone of this question three times.   You may ask "Mother is this the cool breeze of the holy ghost?" or you can ask "Mother is this the all pervading power of Divine love?" or "Mother is this the Paramachaitanya?" Anyone of this question you can ask three times. Now please take down your hands [UNCLEAR WORD]. Tremendous, now all those who have felt, please open your eyes. All those who have felt cool or hot breeze or vibrations on their fingers or on their palms or out of the fontanel bone area please raise both your hands. I bow to you your saintliness. I don't know what to say. I am so much enamored. That's your power of truth.  Now only thing you have to come to the collective and master this out. Some people get it very fast, at the most in one month you will be masters. All the knowledge will be [UNCLEAR WORD] all the knowledge. You don't have to say anything against [UNCLEAR WORD] Only you have to respect your self realization. On little time, All of you can go to [UNCLEAR WORD] and know that [UNCLEAR WORD] one from that you will grow in your self realization. You have to change the world. It is our responsibility now. With all My love all I will [ask] you is please look after your growth. Next time when I come I want to see like great trees. May god bless you!

Tremendous vibrations. Basel seems to me something unique. 

Hello, have you felt it? Not much. Alright put your left hand on your liver. Left hand on your liver. And put your right hand on lap. If you put some ice there. Put some ice. It is because of liver.
[Music starts]
