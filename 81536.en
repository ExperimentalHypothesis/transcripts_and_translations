I remember the door of her living room was open. It was smaller than this room. You remember we went there for Ganesha Puja in '82, Fergie? I've got photos of you there. It was a small living room. Anyway, she had a sort of garden door at the back, and I remember Felicity was there. I remember hovering at the back, and I just looked at Mother. She was sitting on the sofa with the window behind her, and she was wearing a beautiful red sari. She had so much hair in those days. And I remember thinking, "My God, this is who I've been looking for all my life. What went wrong? Where did I get relayed?" And I just thought, "This is the one."

She just said, "Come here." I remember just walking straight up to her and kneeling at her feet. She used to have us put our forehead on her feet, which I did. Then she would put her toes up a little bit, indicating that you should sit up in front of her. It was, forget Chakra Charlie, forget the introductory talks. It was just straight to Mother's feet.

When I was at her feet, I saw this image of a lady riding on a tiger with this wonderful hair, a red sari, and with all these weapons in her hands. It was Durga. I sort of realized because I knew quite a bit about the Indian tradition. But Mother said to me, "What did you see?" I described it. I said, "I saw a lady. She was on a tiger, she had all these weapons, she had this wonderful hair, and she had this red sari." And she looked at me and said, "Hmm, yes. That's me. But in another lifetime. You're very superconscious."

That was my introduction to Sahaja Yoga. So I had no problems, like most of the people in this room, realizing who I was in front of. But there were considerable problems after that.

I would like to say one thing about Krishna, though, which came to my head. When we got Chelsham Road sometime later, I was down to £150. If we have time, I can tell a bit about that story, but literally, I bought that place for cash with 10p in the bank because there was this bankruptcy case sitting on my head. Somehow I managed to get enough money to buy Chelsham Road for cash. It was £41,000. It was rather cheap, no matter what it's worth today. And none of us had any money. Shri Mataji wanted to come because we had this Bhoomi Puja, and we just didn't have the money for food.

I clearly remember sitting around the kitchen table upstairs there. I don't know if you remember this, Krishna, but I was saying, "What are we going to do? We haven't got any money. We've got to buy food for a meal because people are all coming and Mother's going to expect a meal." Krishna disappeared that afternoon. I remember you coming back and putting £100 on the table, which was quite a lot of money in 1980, and it was enough for us to buy the food.

I said, "Krishna, where on earth did you get that money?" And Krishna said, "Well, I took my bracelets to the gold exchange." And of all of us, you were the one who came up with the money for that first food. I shall never forget that. And I thought, "My God, here's a real Sahaja Yogi." I was blessed with a bit of money to buy the place, but I had no money left over for food. Krishna was the one who really came through, and I shall never forget that moment. Of course, Mother came, but that's another story.

Anyway, I was very superconscious.

That's a fantastic story there.
