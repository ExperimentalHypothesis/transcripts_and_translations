Limitations of the Divine Power, Public Programme,  Caxton Hall, London, UK - 5 April 2016

…Divine to work out its working. Because Divine can go up to a point, that’s the trouble. It has no interest in your money, nor in your position or anything. It has only one interest: that you should take to Divine love. And if you go on accepting something that is stupid how can Divine help you?

I have been thinking on these lines all through and I have talked to some of those who came to us that, “How is is [that] you never discovered that they were false gurus?” They said, “We could see. There was something in us that was saying that, ‘There’s something false about this gentleman.’” And still, why did you continue? They said, “Because we were walking in a dark alley and didn’t know whether we were walking forwards or backwards and they said, ‘Go on and on and on,’ promising us about the future.” And that’s the point. Because you are futuristic, you are people who are futuristic, you do not want to believe that you can get your Realisation today. You just don’t want to believe it. You don’t want to listen to that person who says, “You can get your Realisation today.” You want to keep it for the future. Everything postponed for the future. And that’s why you go on living with it, till you are completely finished and wrecked, when Kundalini cannot rise, when you cannot get your Realisation.

I think the worst thing this futuristic society has done to us is that we always postpone even our Self-realisation. Can you imagine? It’s a very sad thing. This kind of postponement is going to lead us into great troubles.

The Divine Power today is so active, so activated. It was never so activated, I can tell you. Those who are Realised-souls can see that. At the time of Vedas the Divine Power which looked like small sparks of light, which you can see, the Realised-souls can see, was called as ‘Bhargo’, ‘bharga’. And in the main mantra of Vedas it was written that, “Make me such that I should be able to see that  bharga, that Divine sparkle, in the sky,” which Sahaja Yogis can see. And for that people were willing to sacrifice anything to get to that state where they could at least see that. But today, because of futuristic society, we’ll also say that, “Alright, we’ll see it tomorrow, not today. Leave it for tomorrow.”

Now this power, today, is so very active it was never that active, it was never that sensitive. Today that Divine power is extremely sensitive and those people who are simple people, who are not futuristic by temperament, can feel it. They are so sensitive to it [that] in a split of a second you can give Realisation to thousands of these people.

So, I personally think that one should try to feel this Divine power, those who are Realised-souls, in its all aspects. And the greatest aspect of it is that, today it is very active. It is very active because so many people are Realised-souls on this Earth. Because of you. It is working out things in such a dimension. I mean, you can see the result of this yourself. For example, when the Sahaja Yogis got this ashram they were amazed. But it’s the blessing of the Divine power. You know how knowledgeable it is. A tree which is a mango tree will have to give mango fruits. This power first sprouts the tree, chooses all of them in such a way that a mango tree gives a mango. Any other tree will [also] give the fruit that it has. The child is born to a mother. People have not heard that dogs are born to human beings. A human child is born to a human being.

So many forces have been active before but today the spiritual force is so magnetic and so great. And the greatest of work it has done [is to] bring forth so many seekers in this world. It’s the Divine force which has brought all of you on this Earth. And now the only problem is of guiding them to the right lines.

Now, the Divine power [which] can be called as the ‘Universal Unconscious’ for people who are not Realised-souls, can give you dreams and you can understand through dreams the symbols, if you could, or even clearly see things by which you can come to Sahaja Yoga. And you can find your Self-realisation. But when a person sleeps, in a deep sleep, he goes to a state called ‘shushupti’. There he does see many things. But when he’s returning to consciousness, that time, there are other layers which cover you up, your memory. Here also the futuristic temperament is responsible. The people who are futuristic have got a very bad memory. Their past is cut out and even when they go into their depth, their memory itself is inactive. Apart from that the mind of a modern man is so full of thoughts and ideas. There’s so much of pressure and load on his head, that by the time he comes to his consciousness, all that he has seen in the dreams becomes to zero and the superficial dreams of this present day life cover it up. So that even the glimpse of that is not convincing or maybe it cannot guide. The telecommunication system of the Divine is through dreams, to human beings, but only the dreams we see in the state of shushupti. For a Realised-soul it is easy to be in that state, to remember it, and to forget about all useless things because he is no more identified with the mundane things of life, with the useless things of life. But the guidance of these dreams, I have seen some people had these dreams. In Rome, I was surprised. In Rome, so many people came to my programme because they saw me in a dream. There was an actress who saw me in her dreams and she came to see me and then she came to talk to me later on and she told me that, “Mother I saw you in my dreams.” And clearly she saw me as something that was important to her.

The activity of this Divine force is also marred when we are taking our spiritual life to some sort of an organised religious form. Now, any religious form, say Indian religious form or say an English or say a Christian religious form, has deviated from reality. One must accept it. It’s a fact, whatever you may say. That churches or temples or all these religions, which were really meant for Sahaja Yoga today - there it is. I have to go and work. But where are they? They are going to deny me completely. Why will they accept me? If I am the redeemer I have to look after them isn’t it? But they are not going to accept me at all. On the contrary they’ll be against me because their activities are either money activities or you can say the other organisational activities and all these nonsensical activities, which has no meaning as far as the Spirit is concerned.

So all such people who are extremely overpowered by these ideas…now just look at the dogmas that people are fighting for. Like, I can’t  understand that Catholics and the Protestants are saying that there are lots of differences. How can you have when the essence is Christ. Essence is Christ. How can you have differences if you believe in Christ. At least on that point you cannot have difference. And once you have all these dogmas covering you and these differences in you, you are identified all the time with something that is really dead, is done by your mental projection, so whatever this power may try, how far can you take it?

And from this deadening thing, when you start to get out of it, you will land up into another problems like these fake gurus. And they are on and on and on because for them it does not matter if somebody is ruined, somebody is suffering from any diseases, doesn’t matter at all, it is what they earn out of you. So they cheat you today. If you get out they have another lot which is willing to be cheated. They go on and on and on. They mesmerise you. They keep you completely under their control. They brainwash you. And there is nothing in between: one side is this darkness of organised ways of looking at things and another is this kind of mesmeric imprisonment from where you cannot get out. Where is the freedom?

And whatever one may try to work out it is impossible to convince a person who is enslave with his own will. Mesmerism is nothing but imprisonment with your own will. You have accepted to be mesmerised, you are accepting it, you are going on and on and when there is a pull still going on all the time that there’s something wrong with this person. There’s something wrong with this kind of Christianity and this kind of Hinduism and this kind of Islam and all those things. But still you go on with it because you have accepted that enslavement with your own desire. It sustains your ego. You think you have been with it throughout so you should [continue to] be. But what about your Spirit? What about getting your second birth? That is in future - next life! This life it’s not possible. It should not be an impossible task but the situation is such today that the whole world is in a trauma, in a shock and the people who know about the future don’t want to look at it, in a way, those who really can see it because it shows horrible things which can happen to us, the way we are moving. Those who know about it know it. And human beings are intelligent enough to understand that there is something definitely wrong with our whole system and we have not been able to correct it. Also they have reached this state. They are not ignorant people today. They are knowledgeable, they understand this. Whether they are with the science or not, whether they are with the Churches or not, in their heart of hearts I am sure there is a kind of an understanding which makes them understand [that] this is not the answer. Definitely they have this idea, I am sure of every one of them who are still a little bit left free. Maybe a priest would not think like that, but I can’t even think of a priest who would not think like that, “There’s something wrong with this system. I’m [going] on and on with this. I have been doing it every day, day in and day out, I’m preaching every day but that’s not the end.” I mean, if they are dishonest, if they could be dishonest to themselves to that extent I can’t say, but they must be thinking [that] there is a way out. But that doubting is killed every moment by giving a new supply of explanations. In the science also there are many people who understand that science is not the end of everything. It doesn’t give you answers to everything. In politics also people realise that it’s a confusion, you can’t say what is right, what is wrong.

The other day I was seeing a very peculiar type of an argument which was really very foreign to me as an Indian, that they were discussing whether to keep the children with the parents or not.
