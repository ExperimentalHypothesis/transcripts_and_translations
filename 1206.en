"How to be respected". The Hague (Holland), 17 September 1986. 

To influence other people we must know how much control we have upon ourselves also. That is very important. For example some people, you see, have no proper image and they try to influence others. So its a mockery. Nobody gets influenced by such a person who himself has no image of his own. So before working out the exterior the interior must be worked out.
For example a person who always comes late to the office and is always delayed, who has no time-sense, is never respected. So when you tell people that they should be in time, you should be the first to arrive at the right time. You must always keep the time, absolutely. You should be a known person for keeping time. Say supposing you have to go to the office at, say, ten o’clock, you reach the office in such a way that you are there five minutes early, wait outside and enter the office exactly at the time when you have to go. That punctuality, it is very important. That helps people and people get an awe for you because they think, this gentleman is so regular and I’ m the one who is absolutely late.
Also, if you tell somebody that I have to meet at such and such time, and this should be arranged at such and such time, then you should be absolutely punctual. That is very important that the punctuality is to be maintained by you. Now, I’ve seen in the West specially, that people get up very late, are very lazy; they walk in a limply manner; and the whole thing shows, that you see,  they are not interested in the world, they are just pushed into it and somehow or other they are doing. Such a person can never influence anyone, because people also see your image, that you yourself you’re dragging your life somehow, so why to do the same thing? – Whatever he is doing. He cannot tell us anything. So that is another reason [why] you cannot influence people at all, if you are yourself a lazy person. So, the person who has to influence others has to be an early riser, must have proper habits of sleeping, must get up in the morning and be properly brushed, washed and everything, and should be what we call a smart man.
Now, many people believe that if you try to be, very sort of a person of a fashionable type, I mean that you wear dresses of a fashionable style and all that, that will influence others. It’s not true. Because they think that you have no conviction of any kind, you see, you must build up an image of yourself that you are such and such, you see, a kind of a character, as we have in a drama, it’s a character. The person speaks with the same character, talks with the same character. And the style should be absolutely known to people that this is your style, that is how you are. That you do not sort of a compromise on things.
[Shri Mataji lay down a glass]
It is very important that when you are talking to people you must have a proper style of talking, walking proper style. This should all be trimmed down properly, that you don’t walk in a languid manner, you see, in a manner of throwing your legs here and there, but straight, and sit down straight. And let people see that you have faith in yourself. First of all, if you don’t have faith in yourself; I mean your any behavior that shows that you have no faith in yourself; you cannot raise confidence [?]. So your self confidence must be shown through yours,  all your behavior program like talking, sitting, walking - communicating. There should be a feeling of confidence. But the confidence comes in a person when he realizes that he is completely secured. And in Sahaja Yoga, as you know, that if your center heart is secured, if you know, tell yourself that: “Mother is with me. Mother is helping me, and I’m with Mother. I have nothing to worry.” Then your center heart will be alright. Of course, this you cannot tell to others. But still, if you have a personality, you can imbibe [means assimilate, digest] that into others very simply. But if you are diffident about yourself, then you cannot do it. So confidence is to be established first of all within yourself. For Sahaja Yogis it’s very easy to say, “I am the spirit, and I am the child, I am the one who has been chosen by the Adi Shakti Herself.” So there should be tremendous amount of confidence in you.
Now, for example when you are, say, with the people, how do you eat your food? Some people open their mouth all the time, eat their food with a sort of a sound. All these things are watched by others, how you eat, how you talk. And also, normally, you should not keep your mouth open, you can never interest people [like that?] but keep your mouth not pursed either, but in a normal way closed, like that, so that people do not think that you are just gaping at them or if you keep your mouth open all the time, or they should not think also that you are aggressive with them or angry. But in normal face, what you call a face that is neither aggressive, nor which is subservient. So it won’t give- supposing you keep a gaping mouth, they’ll think, “he’s an idiot.”, and if you [?] and purse your lips they will think you are a person of a aggressive nature. So, one has to understand how you are sitting before others, talking to others. And to influence others, first of all, as I said, you must respect your own personality, and then respect the personality of others, in your behavior.
Like, receiving somebody clumsy, you should talk to them in a very gentle manner- knowing that there is another God who is coming in. If there is Spirit in me, there is Spirit in you also. So you must see that he sits properly, that he is comfortable, and ask him if he wants any tea or anything. Make him comfortable. Make him feel that you are not in any way disturbed, nor that you are irritated, but you are very happy to meet him and you should settle down with kindness. Sometimes also in diffidence one might feel nervous about a person if he’s there. That nervousness is a sign of insecurity. One should not be nervous if one is talking to someone. One should be in a way that another person should feel absolutely confident and should feel that this gentleman is very pleasant.
Now, another way to impress people is to allow others to talk, listen to them properly, not talk yourself, listen to them, and once they’ve said something, just say, “That’s true no doubt. I agree, but…” Then you can start. So you do not just stun them by your, “No ! Not at all !” like that. But on the contrary, you, see what they say. I mean you can watch me I do that many times. When somebody says [something], “Oh, that is true, but, you see, this is it…” So they don’t mind. They see that you have seen the other side of the thing also, that you have a balance and you don’t just impress your idea upon others. In a way you are, but in a way you do it that nobody feels that impact, that you are doing something of that kind.
Now, as far as possible, never tell anybody to do anything. That hurts people. Say for example, supposing, you people are there, I will tell you that “Do this. Put the lights off.” That after all you are my children, it’s alright, it is a different relationship. But when you are dealing with others, you see, like you should-somebody’s there, sitting : “if you want I’ll put on the light” slowly, while talking you get up and put on the light. Ask him, “Do you mind if I put on the light?” That makes it. But in any behaviorally [behavior], aggression is the first impression. It is the other way round in Sahaja Yoga.
In Sahaja Yoga first raise the Kundalini, then, do this and do that. It is the other way round. You have to build them up from the foundation if you have to impress them [from] outside. To build them up from the foundation, the first thing is that you must infuse in them a kind of a trust in you. They should trust you. They should know that whatever you are saying is the truth. That you are not telling them something that is false or you have no faith in. So in the way you tell them, it influences them very much, that this man is telling the truth. So the whole thing should start from your behavioral style, you can say.
10:21
Now the dress also I would say. Dress is very important in influencing others. Now supposing you are connected with somebody in an official way, or in any way that you want to influence him in the business and all that. Best thing is to wear a business dress, not to wear a dress that is relaxed or casual. You must wear a dress that is a business dress, like, you can say, a deep blue suit with a lot of strips, and a proper three-piece smart thing, and smart, clean shoes, and hair nicely done, may be a little bit oiled, it’s alright, you look like a smart business person.
But if you try to do the fashions of the world, you see, then it changes everyday. Today the hair will be this side, tomorrow that side. So make the hair style as an official would do, it’s  to properly comb them. In the olden days, if you see, even the heroes or any person [?] of the film used to have oil in their hair. They never had this kind of hair which was dry and this and that. I mean, you don’t need oil, but it should be properly groomed as they say. There are lots of things available in the market which can just groom your hair without oiling it. So it should be properly groomed hair and it should not be something- so that it shows that you have paid attention to your appearance as you have paid attention to your hairstyle, and everything. So you make an image out of you which is absolutely suitable for a particular type of a job.
Now, for a cook say for example, if a cook dresses up like a, supposing a cook appears in a swimming suit – what would you think of that? It’s horrid! A cook has to dress up like a cook. In the same way a businessman also has to dress up like a businessman. You cannot go about in jeans in your office, you should not, because if you do it, everybody will do it. And all these things create laxity. Laxity is alright outside the office, outside your business; alright, but not when you have the business. Like we have a drawing room. Now a drawing room is a drawing room, it is not a bedroom. You should not mix them up. Once you start mixing them up there’s no end to it. It can go to any limit. I’ve seen people going to the office in dresses that really look like a swimming suit. So this has to be revived, and can be revived very easily if you tell people that he won’t be able to influence people unless and until you keep that kind of a form and an upright behavior in dealing with others.
It’s another point, very important, that you have to be truthfull. Don’t tell lies. If you have to tell something, then you must tell straightforward. But everything need not be told, that is not telling lies. Every thing need not be told. Whatever you have to tell, you should say : “ this much is this” that’s all. But you shouldn’t tell one thing today, tomorrow another thing, the day-after-tomorrow another thing. That creates a very big gap in the mind of a human being unconsciously, he thinks “he’s only a cheat, and he is trying to evade the issue or something.”
Supposing now I’m talking to you, and then I start looking at the watch. Then it is insulting. Supposing you are talking about something, some particular thing, and then suddenly I change the topic, then it is again insulting, because everybody is intelligent to see that you are trying to avoid the issues. But up to a point you should take it, and then, the whole thing, if it is ridiculous, you should bring it to a point to show that.
14:28
 Like yesterday, I said that, “You see, I never wrote about a serpent. If somebody else has written, why should I explain it? I never call it a serpent’s energy because that confuses people. But if somebody has called it a serpent’s energy it doesn’t matter. What can you do about it” And when you say such a thing, bring it to a ridiculous conclusion of the whole thing, so the person himself keeps quiet.
But you should not suddenly change the topic, that means you are evading the issues, you don’t know how to handle it, you see. This is something sometimes people, just while you’re talking they say, “Alright, let’s talk about this.” You cannot. And diversion in talking like that  can create a big problem. Another is, while talking to others, don’t talk about yourself, “I am this and I” No one likes that. It’s stupid, to talk about yourself. “I have this thing. I am this thing.” Nothing. Now, you just all the time ask other, “What are you doing? What is your profession? How are you.” This. That. All sorts of questions to him. Now he is says to you anything, then you have to talk about your organization’s system, you shouldn’t say ‘I’, you should always say ‘we’. Should always say we : we don’t do; we are; “we” means the organization. Always refer to the organization and never to yourself. “I would not do such a thing. I hate it. I believe in it.” That is absolutely absurd. What we have to do “that we believe. We think this way. And what is your opinion?” We have this kind of a thing.
Or anything that you want to tell them about your own organization or your own product or anything. You have to tell them, that “you see, this is what is available to you. Now it is here, and we have seen that it has done a lot of good, and it works this way. And we have got very good reports about it. You can see the reports, we have the reports here, you can see what it is. And, if you please, you can try it, and see for yourself.” The amount of service you give to the. person is very much appreciated by another person. It’s not only ego, but it makes a person very comfortable.
Like, people would like to travel by Air India very much. Many people say that they would like to travel by Air India. Try to understand why. Because these days it’s difficult, because they examine you too much, and also because of bombing and this and that. So I thought that I would be very difficult. And they have raised the prices of their - what you call- travel because they have to do extra spending on getting people checked, this and that. But the reason why people take to Air India is this, – the ladies who work there are extremely modest type. They look after the people very well. They are not cheap, they are not cheap women, and when they serve people, they take good care and the food is lavish, absolutely lavish, – eat as much as you like, a lot of food. They give you five, six times food, whatever you like. And you feel quite happy to have all that. At the slightest, if you press the button slight, immediately they are available to you.
So what I am saying is, when you are really marketing, you must know you are at the other end. You are not to be serviced, but you have to service. Once you realize that you have to service others your attitude changes, you see. You have to service others. Only through your services they are going to work out. I’ll tell you how.
Like, specially with the English its a big problem. That’s why they are losing so much. They are extremely arrogant. If you go to an Englishman and ask him, “Can I see what product you have?” – “What do you want? “I would like to see the product that you have.” – “Alright. We just now don’t have any arrangements here to give you anything, but if you leave your note we’ll send it to you. Finished. That person is not bothered.
You should be properly equipped all the time to attend to it. In the senses, in an organization, now supposing you are having some product, then you should know all about it, the brochures should be there, it’s all the time available whenever you want it. It should be properly priced, systematically kept. If somebody comes, if you know the person, there is validity, you see, he’s the one who can do some business with you, “Here it is. Please have it. You can see yourself.” Explain to him what it is. And “This is what it is, and we can give you so much concession in that. Could be this much.” All those things are going to capture the market. The market doesn’t capture, not because of the product so much, but because of the way it is put forward.
The way it is put forward is very important, that you have a proper brochure done, by proper people, or you yourself see to it that it is done beautifully. Little money, doesn’t matter, on that. Whatever is spent is a prop of the capital that you have to put in for the product. It is a part of it. If you think that just to do, put a production then it goes, means are part and parcel, in these modern times, of any product being made or sold. It’s part of the product.
To influence people you don’t have to advertise so much as you have to deal with them. I mean, I can tell you this one that, when I had to buy something, anywhere I remember the people from whom I bought it, and the experiences I’ve had. I think I would always go to a person who was kind to me, nice to me – he may take more money, doesn’t matter- but he is kind to me he is not shouting at me, who is well behaved, and his behavior is nice, he doesn’t just try to make fun of me, and also, on the contrary, he gives me all the information and everything. It is absolutely acceptable.
Like, I went to see Lloyds. It is a company where I wanted to put some money. I mean, it is a very big thing to put some money, it’s a bank, they should understand, it’s a custom. Now, they had put a little girl there. After all, the people who are to be contacting others should be people of personality. So some little girl was there. As soon as I came in she asked me, “Who are you?” I told her, “I am this and this.” “Oh, no we can’t have you. You’ve got to have this and, please … we can’t do it.” So I said alright, in deference I said alright, and I gave the name of the high commissioner of India and all those things. I mean, she should understand, that I would not say like that. So, the only thing is that she did not realize that I was with a driver. I had a chauffeur-driven car. I have a Mercedes with me. I was wearing an expensive saree and looked quite respectable; and she should have understood that she should behave to me in a different way than to an ordinary laborer. Here is a real customer. So she said, “all right then, I’d like to have identification, and then I have to do this, and – no, no, no, no, no!”
I got so fed up with them that I went to another bank, that is North West. I have got a bank account somewhere else, but I wanted one near my house. Though it is far away, though it is not in such a good locality, when I entered in, as soon as I entered she could see as she [?] was an intelligent woman, she could see this is a good customer for us. She could see, I was wearing diamonds, this and that. You should see from my personality that there is a good customer coming in. Immediately she said, “Please, let us go into the VIP room.” I didn’t say anything. She took me inside, she talked very gently to me and she asked me and she said: “Can I take one minute?” She went in and she told somebody to telephone and find out about my things and all that and she did not [?] You see, it is not to be done in the presence of a person, but you can verify the person’s personality and everything, secretly, alright,  in a way that he doesn’t feel bad or something and know that “who is this man, is he correct or not? Whether he- but he should not know that you are inquiring. You should not in any way show that you know about him. So, you see, that kind of secrecy helps a lot, because you do not become arrogant. You do not become blunt, or you say bluntly if you tell somebody, no one  likes it that way. The ??? 23:37?? comes when you insult another or you try to put down another person, or you try to doubt another person. There are the three things you should look after that you put the person into a comfortable position and tell him everything, listen to him, what he has to say, trusting him. Then the person looks upon you.
So, in organization, if you have to run any administration and organization, your personality has to be absolutely sensible. Secondly, what you talk, you must follow. Supposing I tell you that you shouldn’t take money, and I start grabbing money from you, supposing, then what will you do? You’ll have no faith in me, will you?

       Actually, when you give me money for pujas I keep them in a packet and use that money for buying the silver and all that for you. I need not. I mean it is out of the question. You have given it in puja, it is supposed to be mine, and I have said, alright, to keep the protocol alright you use that silverware, which is my own, but you can use it. I mean, it's just a joke, but everybody knows that Mother is so clear cut, so clear cut. You have to be clear cut with people. They should understand that you do not play tricks with them, or you are not doing some sort of a backhand outwitting.

       Some people do it, you see, at the back of a person they try some sort of a trick. Such a person is never liked. Nobody respects such a person. But straight forward dealing with a person as he is. If somebody is not alright, in a mild way you should say what the problem is. "We are facing this problem. Now, tell me what is the solution." Then the person does not feel bad. If you tell a person directly they won't like it. No, they won't. You won't like it, if I tell you so directly, but I tell you everything, - and I tell you in a way that is mild, that is congenial, that is easily understood and assimilated. That is very important, that you have a style that people understand, and a proper kind of behavior.

       Actually by not influencing others, you influence others. Art lies in hiding art. There should be no deliberation exposed about it. When talking to someone also, even if you don't understand what they are talking, you should not show that you are understanding and listening. It may be something absurd.

       When you have to deal with three persons, or five or ten persons, then you have to understand that you should always try to create a good feeling among them. Like now for example, I would like you to marry then I will tell you about her, what she is, in a way that will not hurt you or hurt her, but prepare you. Because later on you may hear about her, that somebody was saying so, and Mother never told. So, in a very gentle way you should say, "You see, she has a little of these things, but it's alright, she can be very, very gentle. She can manage it." And it depends on you. How you manage it. So that you feel informed, knowledgeable about a person, and also responsible about it, that how it is my responsibility.

       So, to make people responsible is also a very important part of administration. If you start doing every work yourself then people may never share your work. They will never do anything. To make them responsible the best way is by rewarding them. You must reward them if somebody has done good work. "Oh you have done such a good work." But not directly like that, but in a very indirect manner you must reward that person. Not only in works, but in kind words - you can do it with kind small things.

       I'll give you an example of Rajesh. Rajesh is very sweet, and does not need anything. I mean, he is such a rich man, what can we give him? Once he was taking me somewhere and he had this swiss knife, and he gave it to the driver to cut the fruit or something. And then it vanished. And he was very angry, you see. He couldn't bear this fellow cheating him. He took him to the police station and all that, but he couldn't get it. The driver had managed it somehow you see. It was a taxi. He was very angry with the driver. I saw that and said, "Alright, it doesn't matter."

       The next time I went to India, I took a very nice knife for him. When he saw it, he just melted away. He said, "Mother, how did you remember?"

       I said, "You were so upset at that time."

       He said, "Not because of a knife, but because of the way this fellow cheated me."

       But the whole thing neutralized you see. So, little, little things if you watch of a person, its very sweet.

       Like I'll tell you about Gregoire. Once we went to a shop to find some saris for myself. I was buying some saris and I thought, I've bought quite a lot now. I liked one saree very, very much, but I didn't buy it. I thought it was too much money, - I shouldn't waste all this money, that will not be good. Whatever it is. I gave it up. Next day Gregoire bought the sari as a present to me. Really, I treasured that sari. I remember.

       You see, every incident can be made into some sort of a very valid thing, we can say: like a puja. But like an official makes a difference in an organization where you work. Little, little things like that. Also they should feel that you are responsible for them in an organization, very important.

       Once in my husband's office one fellow joined another organization and he was told not to join another organization, but he joined it because there was more money. And when he went there he found it was all a very horrible thing. There was nothing good happening except for the money. He was very unhappy there, so he wanted to come back. And he came back - my husband was very annoyed, "I told you not to go there. Why did you go? What was the need to do such a thing? Now I can not take you back."

       So the fellow came to me. I don't know why he thought of it, but he came to me. He told me what had happened and that he wanted to come back to the shipping corporation and, I made some mistakes. I think I made a big mistake, and Mr. Shrivastava is somehow angry with me. He doesn't want to take me back. So when Mr. Shrivastava came home I said that he had come to see me. "Oh! So he came to see you. As if you are my boss." - and he got very angry. So I said, "He wants to join your corporation. I think you should give a consideration to him."

       He said, "Why did he come to you?" I said, "I think he thought I am more forgiving than you are perhaps!" That put him right. He said, "What do you mean? I can be forgiving too." "So then forgive him!"

       These are the tricks, you see, which I have naturally. But you can imbibe them also, not difficult to impress others. Such little, little things make a difference, you see. When they are sick you must look after them. Find out if their children are sick, if their wives are sick. You should be concerned and you should be identified. You must treat an organization like a family. Absolutely like a family. What's wrong with her? Is she all right? Do you need any help? This thing, that thing. Send sometimes the flowers when the husband is sick, or the wife is sick, or make enquiries about the children. All these things mean a lot.

       Normally, what people do, on a Christmas day. At the most they may send a card or something. But you can have in the organization a proper card system. You should sign them yourself, and one line somewhere in the thing - 'I hope your wife is alright. I hope the children are alright. If you know the wife, please give my regards to her." There is no need to make them drink like fish, but it is more to make them feel that they are loved and they are liked in the organization. They are very important. This kind of a thing.

       Even the suggestion like you are changing the position of a person. Now, for example if I want Christine to be the leader in America and Gregoire to be there and not to interfere with Christine, - I said, "Gregoire, see now, she is there and she is handling people better. She knows them, people have love and respect. Suddenly you are a new person going there and you will be her husband. So, as it is, you are one of the world leaders, and you should have nothing to do with the local stuff." And he understood it. But if I had said, "Now you don't talk anything there! Now you keep quiet!" I mean, it would not have worked out. And that he is, he knows that very well. He is the one who have come up like that. Anywhere in the world you can go and do anything you like. I would say Rajesh is another one who is coming up.

       Unless and until you make proper arrangements you should not shift a person suddenly. You should try to see that this person who is suddenly shifted is alright. But you should find out if you really want to shift a person or not. If you are uncertain better keep it hanging. Time is the best way to allow things to happen like this. Allow a little time to pass-away. Give a little hint to a person., "People are complaining. What to do? I' d like you to help me." So that he also thinks that you give him sufficient time to improve. But if you don't give any time and you just tell a person, "Now, you get out!" - he'll become your enemy.

       But, on the contrary, you should say, "I'm sorry, but these people are such, they are trying to trouble us and trouble me all the time, and I don't know what is wrong with them, but please take care and all that. And things work out. People take you seriously and they understand that you are responsible for yourself, and that you are putting that responsibility on them. That is how it should be worked out.

       There is a shop in Lucknow that makes very good sweets, very famous for it's sweets. Now his father is gone but the son is sitting there. Big stomach he has got. And everybody goes there to his shop. You can't take a car, you have to walk quite a long distance. Now his trick is such, which I have noticed, he'll first take your order, then you are sitting there and he says (to his boys), "What are you doing? Why don't you give her things? She has been sitting here for such a long time. Look at these people. They just go on taking so much time of people. Now I hope you don't have to go by the aeroplane just now." I said, "No, I am alright!" So, on an apology all the time, you see.

       So then he said, "Why not taste these things I've made specially, just try."

       So you eat something and you say, "Alright, give me some of these too."

       Like that, he goes on, you see, giving time. And then after some time he says, "Look now at these people, how horrid they are. They don't know how to finish the work. Hey! What are you doing there? Why don't you give some sweets to the lady. She has to go now. Why are you taking so much time? I'm Sorry, will you taste them? They'll bring it."

       So, you eat something else. So you say, "Alright." You eat this and by the time you have left the shop all your money is finished and you bought all the sweets of the shop. And that is the trick he plays. Then after some time you discover it and you say, "I know all these tricks. Now will you please give me what ever I want!" Then he'll give it.

       So what I am saying is that a relationship of sweetness develops when you see him sweetly selling his things, his products to us. On the contrary, - "This is my product. If you want, you have it. Otherwise, get out." - "Alright, you get out first!"

       The whole attitude of selling is now turning back to a proper relationship between the seller and the purchaser. It is just a relationship that works, not the product. Let the product go to hell! Nobody is bothered about the product. Of course, if you have five products, and they are equally good, then people will go to the organization which is sensible, which receives people sensibly, respects them and delivers the things in time, and a thing that is not useless.

       Of course, you must find out what is the good with the other organization. What they are having. What they are selling. You should find out, and why people like that? But most of all, what I've seen, that works out is nothing but your relationship with the customer.

       But also your relationship in the office should be good. First of all your personality should be good. People who wear fashionable dresses in the office cannot be good administrators because you see, they become a little loose, and people start taking advantage of a loose personality. But you should be tight - in a sense. Wear an official dress. Always. People have an awe of them.

       In the same way, this new data, like in the office people will call everybody - the driver will call the boss: "Tom, how are you?"

       No respect. It starts like that. Or if the boss takes a drug or something, like in India they take what you call tobacco. Tobacco they eat. What happens, even a peon goes to the boss and the boss says, "Have you got a little bit of zarda?" - "Yes, yes.", takes out his own and gives it, finished. The whole relationship is finished.

       So at that time, if you are taking drugs, if you take drinks, anything, whatever habits you have that are really detrimental, try to cut them. Even if you cannot, you do not expect your subordinates to support that. No one likes cheap type of jokes and things, but these subordinates pass cheap types of jokes and they think they are popular. They are not. Popularity is to be gained by aloofness and singleness. Not by just becoming like them.

       Another incident I'll give you. In C.P.'s office there was a lady who came in jeans, and C.P called her and said, - "Madame, I will not have this. You can wear trousers, or you can wear some sensible dress but not these jeans." You can wear it in the street, you can wear it in the house, you can wear it anywhere - but not in the office."

       She said, "No sir, it cannot be so!" He said: "Alright, then will you please resign. I won't have you."

       And she started wearing proper dresses. Because that really makes a difference, you see. Always a dress makes a difference for proper articulation. Absolutely.

       Now, yesterday, I didn't have a white sari. They never forget white saris for my programme. O, I always wear a white sari for my programme. But I had worn this one, white with a red border. It makes a difference. If I had worn another sari it could not have happened. But suppose I am coming to see you, what sari I wear has an effect on you. "Oh, Mother wore this sari while coming just to meet us." It is like your Iight. Your dress, your behavior is like your light. Whatever you are inside shows out with that. And all these compromises that people have nowadays are spoiling the administration. You must keep yourself, you must keep your position.

       Now in the offices I've seen, people answer back. Your own people answer back. But if you see a Japanese firm, one person will speak, nobody else. They'll all sit tight. When this one person asks them a question, they'll say, otherwise they don't speak. A kind of an allegiance exists between them. The trick is like this; before going to any programme or all that he'll call his five people.

       This is what we are going to do. Now you have to say this, and you have to say this. It's already decided. Nobody is free to talk in the presence of others. We do the same with our children. When Indians have to go to somebody's house, they tell the children, "When you go there you are not to ask for anything. You should not touch anything there. You are not to eat much, or say no to that. Even if you have to eat, take very little. Then before going you say, "Thank you". When you go there you must say, "Namaskar". "All these things are taught in the house first of all. "Otherwise next time we'll not take you."

       So in this way, what happens is that they are already warned. Actually they are knowledgeable about what to do. Suppose you take five people, come along for a meeting, sit down. Then they start arguing among themselves in the same organization. Now Sahaja Yogis in the beginning used to do the same. They would argue with me in the presence of others and it created a problem. So I had to tell them, - in the presence of others don't argue. If you want to tell me, you tell me.

       And between them to create a good feeling, no sense of jealousy or anything. Jealousy is something that plays among your own people. You have to tell, "Everybody has his own job: Everything has to be done, and has to be done well - and we are all together and we are one. No question of this hand having a jealousy with this one, but you are on the right hand and you are on the left hand, so do your right hand work and do your left hand work. And the whole thing will work out. The whole organization has to come up. If the organization comes up, we'll all get advantages." So always build them up in the form of an allegiance as far the organization is concerned. If we have more profits, we have better bonuses.

       May be, I understand your Kundalini's very well-innately. I know how to deal with things, innately. Now, sometimes you have to say about someone, - say, I may say about you to him, "Look after him and do this.' May be he is rather careless. He won't understand what I've told and he might just say, "Mother was saying so!" So I have to warn him, "You just say yourself." Otherwise it won't work out. Why am I telling you? But all these things must be made clear before he speaks. Because once he has done it, what is the use?

       Then, if he comes for your explanation to you, you should be prepared to tell him, "Why did you have to tell him, and I didn't tell him, directly?" So that the other person who has tried to be stupid is put in his own place. And your relations remain alright. So relationships are to be maintained by your own dignity, by your own sense of respect of yourself and the respect of others. As you treat yourself, you treat others. But if you have no respect for yourself, how can you respect others?
