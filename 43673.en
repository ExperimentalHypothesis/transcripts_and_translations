Audio 1:"Please, do not give up hopes.They are created by the Divine as human beings and they have to reach the kingdom of God.I will incarnate myself as Mahamaya and get myself a human Realization, [to get] the understanding of human beings.You did not know their problems as human beings.Human beings are not Realized souls.So, they were misguided by false masters and crooked priests.

All your work is not futile. Once they get the proof of the Divine, they will open their eyes.The fundamentalism in your name will disappear as all your promises will be fulfilled.With my power of love and patience, of a Mother, I will lift them into higher state of awareness of Self-knowledge.They will discover their beauty and joy of their inner beings.

There will be only pure love and generosity among themselves. They will enjoy it forever in their own dignity and glory.Thus, Satya Yuga will be established and the truth will rule this universe."

Audio 2:It was such a surprise for Me, we have such a talented and such a beautiful drama. Very intelligent, I must say, very beautifully put, very artistic. You have to know that all these gurus are watching you, just now. They are all here. They are very happy to see the way you have portrayed them. In such a short time, such a big vision to be seen is really remarkable and that you have touched all the dimensions of the work of the gurus.

So, today, it’s a great day for us to know that you al have to be the gurus and you have to do the work what they have left undone. I’m sure this beautiful talent that you have manifested, will be also manifested in spreading Sahaja Yoga.May God bless you all.

There will be a little interval now and after that we start our music program. Babamama has a Qawwali to start with and then, we’ll have the great musician who is another surprised to Me, mister Apte. Surprisingly, I learnt that in the Egyptian language, Apte means Omkara, can you imagine!So, it’s such a combination! So, we’ll all enjoy that music. For about fifteen minutes, we’ll have an interval and the Qawwals will be organising themselves by that time. Thank you very much, thank you for the whole thing. Beautiful! Thank you.

Audio 3:This is really absolutely a Sahaj song, sung I think- Namadeva lived about, I think, sixteen century. And with him was another very great saint who was Gora kumbhar. Namadeva was a tailor and Gora kumbhar was a potter.

So, Namadeva went to see Gora kumbhar. And Gora kumbhar was that time trying to make the clay for the potter’s job. That time, he saw standing before him Namadeva and he stopped his work. And what he says that, I came to see you for your vibrations, for your formless, but "I see you in form! The Nirakar is becoming Sakar, the Form is appearing before me of the Formless". I mean only a saint can say to a saint, nobody can say this. Nobody can praise another person like this that, "You are standing here before me in form which is formless". And then, he says it in a very beautiful way, that at this time, at this incident, at this "prasanda”, I have gone into the state I am beyond all the gunas, all the three gunas, I am beyond, gunatit. You understand the word "gunatit". I mean this only a saint can say to a saint. Who can understand this? You go and tell anybody else, they’ll say, "What is all this talking about?"

And he’s so beautifully describing the whole meeting and then, ultimately, he says that, "Spontaneously, we felt into embracement, embracing". But he said it in such a beautiful manner a saint can only say to a saint. And the love and the admiration and the adoration of another person is only possible if both of them are saints of a higher values.To them it doesn’t matter what you are, whether you are standing in the mud or whether he is a tailor, doesn’t matter. But he says that, "Just this meeting has taken me beyond all the gunas, means all the conditionings, egos, everything. Something, such a great poet he was, and both of them were.Now, Namadeva, as you know, he was a very great poet, went to also Punjab, and Guru Nanaka respected him very much. I mean only the saints could respect saints; you understand. And he asked him that, "You must lean Punjabi language". And I’ve seen such a big book written and I have one already written by Namadeva in Punjabi language. And in the ‘Granth Sahib’ also, it is included. Even his made servant, was called as Janabai, and her bhajans are there. See, how these people transcended all the casts, communities and positions, everything and just there they were nothing but saints.

It’s such a beautiful song, I wish I could have more time to explain to you everything. But it’s really very beautiful and I must say that Arun Apte has really done a justice to the bhajan written by Gora Kumbhar. Beautifully done.May God bless you.
