SARVJANIK KARYAKRAM, BORIVILLE- MUMBAI; 1979-0126
For the first time, a social program has taken place in Bori Wili today. Although some programs were held in the Shipping Corporation's building and people benefited from them. Today, I am going to tell you something about yourself. Perhaps you do not know why God created you, and you never even think about why God made you so beautiful with so much effort. Why did God make you a human being? You do not ponder over this either. Because you do not have the time to think about who we are and why we came into this world. What is our purpose? Why did God put in so much effort to bring us from a tiny amoeba to the human form over the years? We do not think about this at all because our mind is completely focused outward and cannot turn inward. But if I tell you to look within yourself, to see yourself, you cannot do it. You might ask, 'how is it possible for us to turn inward?’ We are listening to you and seeing you outwardly, but if you tell us to turn inward, it is a very difficult task. How is it possible for us to turn inward and know ourselves, to understand what we have done? We know this because doctors have told us that inside us, there are muscles and bones, and we are covered with skin; within us, the marrow and nerves are continuously functioning. Doctors believe that they have gained a lot of knowledge about many things. But they do not know what power within our body performs all these functions. Who is it that digests the food inside our stomach? Who performs the functions of excretion? Who resides in our intellect to enable the process of thinking? What is this power within us, how is it formed, and how does it function? No one can tell anything about this. When we see a tree, we can only say that it is a mango tree. We can also say what type of mangoes it bears; describe the color of the mangoes, and their taste, and how many times a year it bears fruit, and what kind of mangoes they are. We can describe its leaves, its roots, and its branches, but we cannot explain the power within it that flows through it and produces the mangoes. We do not know the nature of the power that flows within it, how it bears fruit, or how it infuses the fruit with juice. We do not understand this power. Many people will say that this power comes from the Earth, rises up, and performs its function, but what is it? We see countless such living activities every day in the world. We also see that a child lives and grows in the mother's womb, then develops, and after that, is born into the world. If any foreign object enters our body, it is immediately expelled. However, when a baby is established in the body, it is nurtured, taken care of, and all its needs are met. What is this power that functions within us? We are completely ignorant about this; we do not know it at all. We are entirely unfamiliar with the very force through which we are active. If we could somehow gain control over this power, relate to it, or take it into our own hands, perhaps we could perform many tasks that we currently cannot. To understand this power, we have started the promotion of Sahaja Yoga. Sahaja Yoga has been present in the world for eternity. All the activities of this power are Sahaja Yoga. 'Sah' means 'with you,' and 'ja' means 'born.' So, it refers to what was born with you. This is the power that is always present within you, that exists within you, and operates within you. To achieve yoga through this power means to establish a connection with the Divine; this is Sahaja Yoga. This power within humans remains particularly invisible. Doctors refer to it as the autonomous nervous system, where 'auto' means self-regulating. But who is this 'self'? We did not discover what this 'self' is through our search. Simply telling someone that 'this is the Prime Minister' does not reveal who the Prime Minister is, what he is, or how he functions. In a similar way, an obscure name was given to this entity, calling it 'self-regulating.' We do not know it. But this 'self' is actually who we are. When we become this self, we are able to perform all our functions ourselves. This self is the divine element hidden within us, which we refer to as the soul. This soul resides in our heart, but many people speak about the seat of this soul as being located in our head. They say that the soul is within us, and it should be sought after. To find it, you should stand on your head, run, offer numerous rituals, or show a lot of devotion. The more devotion you show, the more money you should donate, and increase the prosperity of these people's organizations worldwide. The soul can never be found through such methods; it will be lost forever. The search for the soul cannot be done in this way. The soul becomes enlightened. Those who live in the world, or in forests, taking vows of renunciation or practicing austerities to search for the soul are on a very wrong path. The soul is revealed within oneself, through one's own natural and effortless state of meditation. What the great thinkers and revered gurus have said is true, and the time has come to prove it. It is now time for us to validate their statements and see whether there really is such a thing as the soul within us. And when it is realized that the soul is within us, only then can you know the Divine. Without knowing the soul, you can never know the Divine. Whether you visit temples or mosques, or go to any extreme, until your eyes are opened and your soul perceives it, you cannot know the Divine. Therefore, the first task is to realize the soul. The entire arrangement for this has been made by the Divine within us; we do not need to make any effort for it. After all, do we have to work hard for the breath we are taking, or for our heart that beats every minute and supports us in every way? Do we need to struggle for the digestion process happening in our stomach? If realizing the Divine and experiencing the soul is extremely important for humans, then it must happen and it will happen effortlessly. However, today's people, especially the youth, have lost faith in the Divine. The reason is that blind people have tried to understand the Divine in a blind manner. They are intellectuals who see that the Divine and the soul are not real, and consider it all to be deception. This is all just a way to fill the pockets of useless people; many such individuals, who don't have any real work to do, have found a good excuse and an enterprise for earning money. It's true that the Divine cannot be known through intellect, but with intellect, you will reach the point where you will understand that the Divine cannot be known through intellect. But that doesn't mean you should abandon intellect; I am not saying to give up intellect. Intellect will remain fully intact, but there must be realization. Knowledge is one thing, and realization is another. When realization of the Divine occurs, it does not come from giving lectures or from clearing your brain. One thing is an event that needs to occur within you; you must experience it, you must become one with the soul. Until that happens, any discussion is completely futile. At this moment, I am only guiding you to the point where you will have to stand and wait for that event to take place within you. You must express it with intensity. Now, another important thing to understand is that you cannot do anything to achieve this; you cannot buy it in any way. I feel a bit strange even saying this, but many people believe that the Divine can be bought; they think they can give money or use proxies to obtain it. Some people call a priest and say, 'Fine, perform the ritual and finish the job.' It doesn’t work that way. We live at such a superficial level, on such a shallow surface, that we don’t realize that truth cannot be obtained through these methods. Truth cannot be bought; it is realized. For instance, when I speak about this, people from all sides, including priests and clerics, come at me with their criticisms. People may say, 'What are you talking about, Mother?' But I am making arrangements for their next life to ensure that they are not born into a dirty place due to their sinful actions. I am arranging for their heaven so that by committing such dirty deeds and selling the Divine, they do not end up in hell because of the harm they have done to us. This may seem very revolutionary, but it's not something I have said for the first time; Nanak said it, Kabir said it, and all the saints have said it. Sai Nath, too, has said it. Only those who are interested in your money and care only about your purse will not tell you the truth. They will never speak the truth to you. But those who care about your upliftment and the realization of your soul will tell you to ask for only what is Divine; there is no need to ask for trivial things. Krishna himself said that he takes care of yoga and kshema; he first mentioned yoga and then kshema. He said, 'I will first provide you with yoga, and then kshema will follow.' If one has not established a connection with the Divine, how can we expect their well-being? Just like if someone is not an Indian citizen, why would the Indian government take care of them? Although the Indian government does not always take care of us either. In the kingdom of the Divine, until you become a citizen of that realm, why would the Divine look after you for no reason? Just like when people come to me with a long list, saying, 'Mother, my son should get a job, my daughter should get married, my business should prosper, my child's ear problem should be cured, my aunt has cancer and it should be cured.' I said, 'Wow, you've given me your entire list. How much is in your account with the Divine? It seems there's nothing there, not even an overdraft. So how can I help you? If you have no claim, no understanding, and no connection with the Divine, then what can I do for you, my child?' If someone comes to me and says that I haven't done anything for them, I have made good arrangements for them to be born, roasted, and die in hell—what else should be arranged? One must understand that to attain the Divine, we should have at least some spiritual wealth. However, as I say, this land of India itself is an immense and significant spiritual wealth; being born in this land of yoga is due to the many, many good deeds from past lives. Perhaps you won't believe this, but when you go abroad and see how people are suffering in hellish conditions, you will believe it. Due to numerous good deeds, you are born in this India, and because of this, self-realization can be very easy for you. But here, people think that becoming like foreigners will bring them great welfare. It is necessary to tell a bit about their situation; in England, every week; two children are killed by their parents. These are good children, not immoral ones. Can you believe it? A mother herself kills her children. Here, it is different; you know that not a single mother abandons her child. They have created such a world there that no one can live together for even five days without conflict. If two people manage to live without fighting for five days, it's considered a challenge. This country is filled with love; love flows from each saint here. Now, if you want to follow in the footsteps of the British and walk their path, and elevate yourself in the same way, then first go and see the pit into which their children have fallen, and then consider them your leaders. First, these people should go and see where those we are chasing after are heading, what their condition is, and how they are ruining their lives from morning till night. They should see how they are spending each moment of their lives destroying themselves. The highest number of suicides occurs in the most prosperous countries, where there is the most money. Yet, we are running madly after money, clothes, and worldly possessions our whole lives. One should understand that a human's needs are very few. It's fine if you want to go through their struggles, stumble like them, fall into the pit, and then come to me for help; I'm ready for that as well. But you can shortcut this process. You can narrow its scope. If you progress in Sahaja Yoga, you will understand what you truly are. Just like a machine needs to be connected to the main power source to function, similarly, you are also like a machine. Until you are connected to the main source, you won’t find any meaning, whether you become English, a monkey, or anything else. You need to become a higher being, to become what you were meant to be, which has led you from an amoeba to the Divine up until today. Sahaja Yoga is a very significant thing; it explains how these energies are present within you and how they are activated, among other aspects. I don’t have enough time today to explain all of this, but I will share a bit more tomorrow. But today, I want to say only this: You should ask, 'Mother, please take us across. Just give us self-realization, and nothing more.' This alone would be a great accomplishment. Many people in Borivali will cross over. It is easier to cross over because we can also achieve things through our own resolve. Everything depends on your efforts, and knowing all this, we want you to cross over. But after crossing over, when I have placed you in the boat, the boat continuously dwindles while moving. (Unclear) It is your job to stabilize it. This is a very subtle process and happens with great difficulty. Everyone says that awakening one person’s Kundalini is extremely difficult, so how does Mother manage to do it for thousands? There is no doubt; it has been done. Thousands of people in villages and rural areas get self realized effortlessly. It happens. If you want to see, you can come and observe; why it happens, how it happens, we also have something, we are also a bit like magicians, and there must be some special quality within us. Whether you believe it or not, it exists. There is indeed some power that makes possible what was never accomplished in the world suddenly become achievable. And without contemplating this, you should cross over. We are your Mother, and we are ready to serve you fully. We are prepared to work hard, but you will also need to cooperate with us a little. After that, you will need to stabilize, and only after stabilizing will you understand what the truth is. Before that, nothing can be understood; it is not even clear whether God exists or not, whether to believe or not. There is no answer to whether anything exists or not. That is why I say that God has created everyone like computers, but unless they are connected to the main power source, no question or answer can be resolved. We cannot know anything that is indestructible, infinite, and absolute. Therefore, attaining this thing is a significant task. It is not something you can just shop for in the market; it is a very serious and extremely subtle matter. It should be accepted with humility. I hope that many of you will cross over today. I am confident that this task can be accomplished. I had mentioned this in Borivali as well; some people wanted it there. (Unclear) The ‘Raja Bhaiya’, who is a very prominent Sahaja Yogi there, you should take his address. There is also a program here tomorrow; we will come here again, and everyone will come. You should fully attain it. Just as when the Ganges flows, people no longer recognize its significance. On the other hand, if there is a circus or someone performing miracles by extracting diamonds, people will rush to see it. But does God have any other business, like opening a jewelry store? To those He gives, He should say to solve the country's problems. The rich are the ones who keep receiving jewelry. It's fine; this treatment is good for the wealthy. Those who are extremely rich are not likely to come to Sahaja Yoga; I don't think they will come. They may come when their understanding is corrected. Because this is a modest path, extremism in anything is not good; it either ruins the mind or damages the body. That causes an imbalance or disorder. Therefore, arrange to attain the Divine today. As soon as you attain the Divine, everything becomes right; there is no extremism, and life becomes completely balanced, full of joy, error-free, and peaceful. Tomorrow I will explain what the benefits are, but today I will just tell you that when you sit like this, with your hands open towards me, and with humility as if you are asking something from me, simply and respectfully, then the Kundalini within you will awaken. This is because these five fingers and these five fingers represent the centers and chakras within you, which are very subtle and not in a good state from here. After the Kundalini within you is awakened, the first thing that happens is that you become completely thoughtless. When you close your eyes, you will see that no thoughts are coming from inside. After that, when the Kundalini pierces the Brahmarandhra, a wave of consciousness will begin to flow through you, like a cool breeze. When you hold your hands towards me, a cool breeze will come from me to you. Sometimes, due to imbalance, the coolness may come to one hand and not the other; we will balance it. As long as milk and water are not separated, talking about anything has no meaning. Today, you should attain it, and tomorrow I will explain everything about it: what this power is, how it operates, and how you should manage it. Besides, we have Yaj Sahib, Warit Sahib, and others who are great Sahaja Yogis living in this area; you should make use of all of them." There may be issues with the chakras, and we will fix those as well. But first, we need to start your motor and give you the experience; then we will address further details. Keep your hands like this and close your eyes. If you feel any sensation, then open your eyes."
