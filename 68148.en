Conversation after Arrival, New Rochelle (United States), July 25th, 1988

Yes, how beautiful they were! [Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi about Emile Zola] Then, he is trying to show in one woman, four types of womanhood [in the book ‘Nana’]. But [Hindi]. It’s like that.Very sublime.

[Hindi]. Must read. I am rereading something, it’s important, good things.

In Sahaja Yoga, we don’t believe in somebody reading and getting Realisation. But after Realisation, you must read.[Hindi].So many books, one can read. These days, I have no time to read.Grégoire: If they are good you inspired them all, Shri Mataji.Shri Mataji: Hum?Grégoire: If they are good you inspired them all.Shri Mataji: It's true but - American magnets [unsure], they haven’t got much, except for writing. They just digest these things all right [unsure]. These days, it’s not so bad. Sometimes you get funny articles in that also.Also, in between, they want to popularize themselves whatever it is, but they have kept quite a good standard.

Also, apart from that, oratory and ? point of knowledge, must read.Now let's seek general knowledge. What was the name of Abraham Lincoln's wife?Sahaja Yogini: Mary Todd.Shri Mataji: Hum?Sahaja Yogi: Mary Todd.Shri Mataji: Correct. How many knew? It was a terrible woman. Of Abraham Lincoln, you read 'Unknown'. It was a very beautiful book. ’Unknown’.[Hindi: Unknown, do you like?]Sahaja Yogini: Dji [yes].

Shri Mataji: How are you?[Hindi conversation about Ganapatipule]Every Sahaja Yogi must come every year. It's very nourishing, I think. Ganapatipule is very nourishing. This time, most of you will have to stay in tents and things like that. Because these people were having very funny - when we asked them for the holidays, they said, "We can give you only few rooms. Because there are others who want to come also during holiday". But holiday suits us better, isn't it? Seven days of holidays or eight days of holidays.

So how are you arranging there, Gavin?Sahaja Yogini: For the Tour in India?Shri Mataji: Ah.Sahaja Yogini: Oh, I haven't spoken to Lucinia. All I all I've heard, so far, is that it started on the third and finishing on this first; 31st or first.Shri Mataji: Yes. You can start it even earlier if you want. You see, because they wanted to come back, arrive here on the first. So, when do you want to arrive, to be able to attend to your work? When do you start your work here is the point.Sahaja Yogi: Usually, the holiday is between Christmas and New Year. So, people usually go back to work after the New Years.Shri Mataji: So, second.Sahaja Yogi: At any time after the New Year.Shri Mataji: So, even if you leave on the 31st, you'll be here on 31st. The travel is just ? The travel is just after, you see. So, if you leave on the 31st, you'll be here on 31st. Then one day you can rest. And next, you go for work. So, you should finish on the 31st. So, we can start it on first December.Sahaja Yogini: As you wish, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: Shri First of December to 31st. But Ganapatipule, it could be - Dany, let's see. Say from twenty- twenty fourth; 24th, 23rd. Twenty third; 23rd, 24th, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30. 31st you’ll be traveling. [Hindi]Eight days. All right? So, we start on the 22sd. Ganapatipule, we arrive on 22sd night.

[Hindi]

Rajesh appointed a very famous architect. Actually, if he had asked me, I would have said, "Never touch him". Because he made a public building, ministry corporation. And to climb up five stores. He made a circular- what you call-Sahaja Yogis: Staircases.Shri Mataji: Circular staircases. And the people: imagine, at five o'clock, they are so much in a hurry to go down. There's so many of them who come to the – [Laughter] little [unclear] you see, and they sit down like monkeys.[Laughter]Sahaja Yogi: It gets down pretty fast.

Shri Mataji: All right. You see, Vishal, he is [unsure]. If there's a bee, you see, he doesn’t like a bee. What it does, it makes the bee look like a triangle [unsure]. I mean it looks even worse than it.Sahaja Yogini: If there is a bee.Shri Mataji: Yes. But what I've seen in his house, Rajesh’s house, that the steps are about seven inches rice, you know, and five inches foot. I mean, you have to [Laughter]. And the best part of it, the bed, he has already made of cement.Sahaja Yogini: Mother is right.Shri Mataji: [Hindi]

"It will not cost anything; I'll give you bed step". "Are baba, remove this cement bits". Your Mother was telling him, "Baba, I want only white marble". He would not listen. He wants to put white marbles, sandstone, this - I mean this sandstone, you cannot keep it clean. I know what sandstone is. And then, the best part of it, he wants to put- this is the interior decorator which is another real mad cap.Sahaja Yogini: Yes, he is completely crazy.Shri Mataji: [Hindi]Sahaja Yogini: Yes.Shri Mataji: You know what he did? To begin with, he had made a discotheque first of all, and he used the WC seats for sitting down.Sahaja Yogini: Really?Shri Mataji: Ah! Actually, it’s well known. Think about it.Shri Mataji: Rajesh has [unclear]. And I know it so well. And I asked, Bansury. I said, "Bansury, why don't you go?" She saw my house, she said, "Mother see, how fast you have built such a big house!" I said, "You go yourself". She said, "What. I go there but, he is planning for the last six months, [unclear]. Every day, he draws. Then there is a pile of papers. But he doesn’t like it. [unsure]. He says, "No good, no good no good". So, what is there to plan [unclear]?" I said, "Just get it and put it there".

I can't understand.

I’ve built this house. So, it's such a big house, in such a short time.

But when I went there, he ran away. Thank God. I don't know, he got some work and he run away, thank God.

Sahaja Yogini: I went last week, but things are moving.Shri Mataji: Hum?Sahaja Yogini: [Hindi].Shri Mataji: [Hindi].

First, I didn't want to go to that house. I told Rajesh I'll go, but then, if I say anything, you shouldn’t mind. "No, no. I want you to come and see". I said, "What is this?"

And then you tell him that I don't want that, "I don’t want this thing. "This is all right. You go ahead. You do it". Now halfway, poor Rajesh has no time. It’s some blackmail, absolutely.[Hindi conversation.]

Bahut [really], it’s not a normal person. He looks pour [unclear], womanish, ne [isn’t it], feminine birth. Effeminate.

Sahaja Yogini: Jai Shri Mataji, mister C/P/ is on the telephone.Shri Mataji: Where is it, the phone?Grégoire: You would like to take it in your room?Shri Mataji: All right.Grégoire: OK

Who else is there? Did you meet Shri Mataji yet? No. [Inaudible whispers.] And? Dattatreya would you- this is for me?Sahaja Yogini: This is for you from Andrew from Main.Shri Mataji: From?Sahaja Yogini: From Main. It’s north of Boston, two hours from here. We have a small center here.Shri Mataji: I see. So, you’re starting a center there.Sahaja Yogi: Shri Mataji, Craig and Georgia started a center in Portland and Maine.Shri Mataji: You and who?Sahaja Yogini: Her husband.Sahaja Yogini: My husband Craig.Shri Mataji: ‘Atcha’, Craig. So you started- who is Craig?Gregoire: Who is Craig?Sahaja Yogini: She had to go down with Harriet.Shri Mataji: So, you started this one.Sahaja Yogi: Yes.Shri Mataji: It’s good. Eyes are just [laughter]. Beautiful. May God bless you.

Sahaja Yogi: Shri Mataji, this is Henry [Faye ? Unclear] from Colorado. He's the only Sahaja Yogi in Colorado as far as we know right now. [Laughter]Shri Mataji: I remember being there, in Colorado, I must go. You see, there are lots of seekers in Colorado, but they are lost people, quite a lot. This fellow, what's his name? Is this uh Ananda Mark? People have quite a lot there, in Colorado. You know them? Have you heard about them?Sahaja Yogini: Ananda Mark ...Shri Mataji: Those who were sort of banged, they used to murder people.Because, one was mister doctor Prasad who was working for this [name unclear], he has lived/been in Colorado, so there are lots of seeker all there. You should send him that.Gregoire: For your Vanessa program in Colorado? [Laughter]Henry: There's a very beautiful place in Colorado Springs called Colorado Garden.Shri Mataji: How did you come to Sahaja Yoga, when did you come?Henry: Through digital. I read and noticed there Phil Ward.Sahaja Yogi: Yes. He saw Phillip Ward has been putting announcements in the computer network. And Henry saw this, and then we've been communicating through actually computers, and then we sent him a photograph and he came to -Shri Mataji: Sahaja yoga is on the computer now? [Laughter]Sahaja Yogi: Yes, it is.Shri Mataji: How do you put it on the company?Gregoire: Phil Ward should explain, I think.Shri Mataji: YesPhil Ward: Shri Mataji, on this computer network, it's accessible to about 100 000 people who work for the company. So, I wrote a little article describing Sahaja Yoga it said, "If you would like toknow more, let me know and I'll send you Shri Mataji's photograph and samples of meditation.Shri Mataji: But where did you write this article?Phil Ward: I just, I was sitting in Nibe [name unsure] because I wrote it on the computer, that's somewhere in New England, somewhere.Shri Mataji: Hum. I see, I see.Phil Ward: And so far, about 30 people have written. All told and –Shri Mataji: Really?Phil Ward: And about now three of them - there's also Paulo the Chinese fellow.Sahaja Yogi: He met you in San Diego.Shri Mataji: Yes, yes.Phil Ward: He came that way. And there's also a girl near San Francisco, called Helene, but she wasn't able to come this weekendShri Mataji: That’s a good and subtle way, very subtle, isn't it? Very good.[Laughter]

But on a general one, on a general computer or, where did you put it?Phil Ward: Well, it's in a file that's accessible to anybody on the network. They are different, they're called conferences, and there are different conferences devoted to different subjects. And this particular one is where all the seekers write about their experiences. And so, there's all sorts of rubbish in there.[Laughter]

But at the same time, this is where the seekers come so.Shri Mataji: You see, there was a suggestion recently, that there should be a now a book written about me and the miracles. And the miraculous photographs should be put there. That is the best way to propagate Sahaja Yoga. What do you say to that?Phil Ward: It would be great, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: So, I think I'll have to ask you to do that. Because [Laughter][Applause]You have seen these photographs, have you? These are really miraculous. These are the photographs I'm sitting here and all the Devis, Devdas are sitting around. [Hindi]

Here you can also see the angels with their wings.You’ve seen Mark? Not yet? You haven’t seen this one?Mark: No.Shri Mataji: [Hindi]

Ah! That one! You show that one also: angels, all the angels there.

This is that ‘anther pattern’ [unsure], you see, between the - they hold the cloth, that one is here. And just see the arrows that these deities are sending in the marriages. This is when you people got married.Sahaja Yogini: Oh, oh!Shri Mataji: That time.

See the boys having vibrations on top of their heads. There’s one is missing, where all the Sahaja Yogis are sitting; on top of their heads is the light. And if you read it from this side, in Arabic language, it is Allah. And from the other side it is Nirmala.All Sahaja Yogis: Ah!Shri Mataji: In Arabic language. Very interesting.

This is me looking like a Kumbha and all the vibrations there. And this is the girls, you see, when they were getting married. All the flowers falling on them. The wild flowers

Sahaja Yogini: Shri Mataji, it’s me.Shri Mataji: It’s there? [Hindi conversation][Laughter]

See now! So, how important are your marriages that all the deities were putting flowers on you. And this one is - see now, understand that. This one is where he was holding that ‘anther pattern’ [unsure], so she is Shri chakra and all the flowers falling. And the Shri chakra. The girls are here on this side. [Hindi]

Who else is has not met me?Gregoire: Anyone has.Sahaja Yogi: This is Lynn from Cincinnati, Mother. Her name is Lynn.Shri Mataji: Hum?Sahaja Yogi: Her name is Lynn. She’s from Cincinnati.Shri Mataji: Cincinnati. Yes. So slowly, slowly, we are spreading everywhere. Sahaja Yoga cannot grow very fast, because the speed is in proportion to how many people there are to balance. And if you get thousands how will you manage them? Because you have to make something out of them. They have to become something.

And these photos were taken by a very ordinary boy, who is a first-year medical student. He says, "I've never handled much of camera". And the cameras, you see, these people brought as present to him, ordinary camera, from that. And he said, "Mother, what has come out of my camera?" [Laughter]He was quite frightened, you know, to see this.You didn't tell her name. Lynn, Lynn is her name?Sahaja Yogini: Yes.Shri Mataji: [Hindi] I should know about this.

Gregoire: So, they have something to ask.Sahaja Yogini: Mother, I wanted to ask you what would be the best thing to do with my daughter Sydney as far as schooling. We had - I had written to Anne-Laure to see if it would be possible for her to go to school in Switzerland.Shri Mataji: How old is she?Sahaja Yogini: She's just turned six. She finished kindergarten here in America.Shri Mataji: So, she can easily. But they haven't started. They'll be starting in I think, in September or something. Oh that's all right. They are going to start now. They have lots of people this time, pupils, I should say. And that would be nice if she’ in that school. And you, actually, come from Switzerland in any case so.Sahaja Yogini: My mother lives in France, very close to Switzerland.Shri Mataji: But your father was from Switzerland, wasn’t he?Sahaja Yogini: He was Norwegian my father. But he worked at the United Nations in Geneva for many, many years.Shri Mataji: Oh, that's how.Sahaja Yogini: Yes.Shri Mataji: A Norwegian. What about Norway? What do you think?Sahaja Yogini: My sister is there. She is meditating.Shri Mataji: What does she say about the people?

They are the only three countries we have no feed-back, this Norway, Denmark and which one is the?Sahaja Yogi: Sweden.Shri Mataji: Sweden. Norway. They have a funny type of socialism there.Sahaja Yogini: Mother, I lived there for 10 years.Shri Mataji: Where?Sahaja Yogini: Norway.Shri Mataji: Really?Sahaja Yogini: Yes. I know the country is very rich and the language and the people love you indirectly.Shri Mataji: Indirectly.Sahaja Yogini: Cause they love the nature. But they know nothing of religion. They have rejected their own state religion.Shri Mataji: They have no religion?Sahaja Yogini: They don't, they have a state church, ritualism, but no one goes. They go into the hills to hike and to ski.And they go alone, they don't go with groups. They go by themselves. And they [unclear] peaceful but repressed. The family is very important, the woman is important. But the socialism is a fraud? It's not quite what they publicize.Shri Mataji: It's so funny they have a socialism. Because, see how it will work out there. I met some people, some young people, but they said, "The young people here are, more sort of business like". They want to have motorcycles, and-Sahaja Yogini: Yes, they become wealthy. They found oil in the North Sea. And prior to that, they weren't like that. I have a Norwegian son and he is a seeker. He has not come to Sahaja Yoga yet,and he said that those who seek are persecuted.Shri Mataji: Those who?Sahaja Yogini: Those who seek, the young who seek are persecuted by those who do not seek, and that they have to suffer.Shri Mataji: So, they don't want to see.Sahaja Yogini: No. Those who do seek are persecuted by the youth who do not seek. And so, they don't stop seeking, but they have to do it more or less secretly, or be by themselves. Because they have an animosity towards seekers.Shri Mataji: I mean, the young people.Sahaja Yogini: Yes it's like two cults, one is seekers and non-seekers and there are very few who are seriously seeking God. And they have got caught in drugs. So, there is that problem too.Second Sahaja Yogini: There's a lot of drinking in Norway. They drink very much, very excessively.

But despite all that, they're wonderful people.Shri Mataji: Hum?Second Sahaja Yogini: They're wonderful people.Shri Mataji: They're simple.Second Sahaja Yogini: Yes. They're sweet. They're wonderful

Shri Mataji: I don't know that.Now Greece is over, we are in Greece, we have got 500 people meditating. But these three countries, if you can manage somehow. They should not say that, "You never did anything for us". We have to look after [unsure].

As now, with this Colombia, I think we can go to Bolivia, Peru, all that. Even Argentina and say, Chili. But I don't know about the rest of it, how will you manage. Because these three countries are really - I think they're quite superficial type of people: day-to-day living entirely. Finland is better. Finland people, because they are farmers, you see.

Sahaja Yogini: Mother, may I ask you how was the situation in Brazil? I heard that they have started Sahaja Yoga.Shri Mataji: Brazil?Sahaja Yogi: Brazil.Sahaja Yogini: In the north of Brazil, I heard they started Sahaja.Shri Mataji: Now this boy who is –Gregoire: Duilio.Shri Mataji: Duilio.Gregoire: He’s Italian.Shri Mataji: Does she know about that?Sahaja Yogini: No, because I'm from Brazil, this is why I am interested.Shri Mataji: This fellow, Duilio is starting an ashram very near the seashore.Sahaja Yogini: Salvador.Shri Mataji: Salvador. And he has a very plan. I saw, gave him the design of the ashram. And he got a beautiful thing. And he is in architecture. So he and his wife both are going to start an ashram there. It's beautifully designed. It's very good, but let's see if it works out. He has bought a land there.

Sahaja Yogini: Mother, my daughter and I we are from Brazil.Shri Mataji: I see.Sahaja Yogini: And we would like to know whether you would like us to [28:21; no sound]

Shri Mataji: Brazil is a nice place, I mean, we can do a lot. Let's see with this thing, what happens, maybe.

Sahaja Yogini: Mother, if you permit me to ask you, we have met you [unclear], my mother and I met you-Shri Mataji: Yes, I know.Sahaja Yogini: And you saw my son. I wanted to know if you thought and advice, or if I live him for a period of time in Rome, to help him.Shri Mataji: In, you mean, Brazil.Sahaja Yogini: No, no. Rome, my son, by himself, in Rome.Shri Mataji: In Rome.Sahaja Yogini: Do you think that would be wise?Shri Mataji: Yes, it’s wise.Sahaja Yogini: And we’ll be there until this. He’s much better since you’re with him. He's now himself so much calmer.Shri Mataji: Yes, that should be nice. That's a very good school in Rome.

Yes. We had a plan to build the school and an ashram in Rome. And we bought a lot of land also. I borrowed about 100 000 to buy that plot. But it turned out to be very far away. So, then everybody said, "It's going to be very far away, Mother ". So, we are now selling out that plot. And we are thinking of buying another place now. We have to start a children's school, small children. And also for people to live there. So, they're trying to find out some place. Just now, it's all right for a year or so, this school is there. But they esteem that we, all Sahaja Yogis, should contribute about a hundred pounds per year. It’s not much. Hundred pounds per year is not much. If you all contribute, it can provide for so many things like schools, ashrams, this. Now the first lot has to go to Vaitarna school because that is imminent. Immediately, we must start working on that. It will take about two or three years; by that time, we should be ready to go. So, Vaitarna school is the first thing I'm going to do. But then, every year we’ll have this money. And now, as Sahaja Yogis are growing, see, we’ll have this money. With this money, we can always do all these things as you were saying, that in Rome, we can have a proper school. Or we can have also an ashram, say, in different places.

Gregoire: Shri Mataji, perhaps, before you have your bus, can we take your mantra to welcome you?Shri Mataji: Yes.Gregoire: Let us, by taking the mantra, ask Shri Ganesha to remove all obstacles and to call the seekers to Shri Mataji’s lotus feet.[Mantra to Shri Ganesha][Mantra to Hamsa Swamini][Mantras of the Sahasrara]

Shri Mataji: May God bless you all. May God bless you all.

May God bless you all. Everybody has a beautiful, beautiful Kundalini.Now ask them if they can enlarge it.I’m going to Guru Puja if you can get them to enlarge it.Gregoire: I thought you were speaking about the Kundalini. [Laughter]You said, "Ask them whether they can enlarge it". I thought you were meaning our Kundalinis.[Laughter]

Shri Mataji: Actually, enlargement is not being there. They are spreading because, you see, height is the same. Spreading is the point. You should spread it on the left and right side. The light should be more on the left and right side.Just ask these people if you can do something.Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

Shri Mataji: So, thank you very muchSahaja Yogi: Thank you Shri Mataji.Gregoire: Thank you Shri Mataji for being here.

[Hindi conversation]Sahaja Yogi: Dji [Yes]. He comes to all the programs. Jai Shri MatajiShri Mataji: [Hindi] : May God bless you.

[Shri Mataji leaves the room]

Gregoire [to Sahaja Yogis who are leaving the house]: Very nice to see you. We'll meet again. We meet again this evening at the program. I think there is one car with Phil. Phil with whom are you?Phil: I’m using the van.Gregoire: You are in the van. How many cars do we have? So, you can hang around here and Steve too. But, I mean, basically, you know, the house has to be quiet, because Shri Mataji has to rest.
