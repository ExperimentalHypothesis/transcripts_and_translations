圣誕崇拜

印度格纳帕提普蕾1997年12月25日

Translated from Hindi:

Today, we are here to celebrate the birthday of Shri Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ’s life was very short and He spent most of His time in India, in Kashmir. He went back just for last three years and people fixed Him to a cross. It was somewhat destined. To open Agnya chakra He had to offer this sacrifice. So in this way He set up Agnya chakra. Agnya chakra is very constricted small and not easily openable because a human being got freedom that made him egoistic. This ego constricted his Agnya chakra. And from that constricted Agnya chakra it was necessary to take out ego And to take out ego you have to control your [MAAN]. But you do not take out your ego from your [MAAN] As soon as you will try to take out your ego from your [MAAN] the [MAAN] will go on increasing and the ego will go on increasing [ AHAAM KAROTI SAHA AHAMKAR ] We do ! It means that if we try to minimise our ego the ego will shoot up because we will try to do so with the help of ego only. Those who think that to our ego will suppress will eat less food worldwide violence one standing on one foot and some on their head Every type of experiment people do to destroy their ego But it does not supress the ego. It shoots up. To fast, to do [JAP TAP] everything shoots up ego ! [Havana] also gives rise to ego ! Because Agni is right sided. Whatever karmakand we do, rituals we perform gives rise to our ego. For the past thousands of years human beings have been doing the same type of karmakand. Everything inside out whatever has been taught, is he doing. This is why Sahajyoga is against karmakand. There is no need to do any karmakand. And to go to the extremes is all the more bad. As I said that to take away your ego you, in Marathi is called [‘ JODE PATTI’] beat ‘it’ with shoes. So daily in the morning Sahajyogis move out in a line with shoes in their hands. O.k ! but if you have ego, then only Every one is going out with a shoe in his hand. All this karmakand penetrated into Sahajyoga too. So much so that from France a gentleman came from Vashi hospital and got this karmakand from there. It is for sick people. If you have this trouble, then you do this karmakand The karmakand of cancer are written in that. I said it is human being’s nature to do karmakand because he thinks that he can do it because of my karmakand, work will be done and in this karmakand not only you in foreign country also many people go on doing karmakand of various types. For example will go to church once a year. means today after that they don’t take even the name of God. after doing all the dirty jobs of world and go to Catholic [ DHARAM ] and make confession If you can see this foolishness, then will be a Sahajyogi. If you can understand that this wrong act What we have done is wrong and now onwards this act is not to be done. If you can understand this your brain will retain it Now Karmakandis have got all the more qualities. One thing is that they are misers number one. If you talk to them about ten rupees they start jumping into the sky. That is called in Marathi, ‘KODI CHUMBAK’ One thing is that in Marathi there are such words That your ego will dissolve easily. For example somebody talked high of himself, i did this, i did that tell him in a low voice ‘You are climbing a chickpea tree’. A chickpea tree doesn’t exist ! [Shri Mataji speaks in Marathi] So he cools down. I did this, i did that, i Till this ‘I’ ness doesn’t go till then our recognising Christ is wrong. But it is surprising that what is called Christian Nations where there is chritianity more than them egoistic I have not seen particularly English. American everybody is so much egoistic that can’t understand these desciples of Christ. Now what is the remedy of this ego? that should be thought It’s remedy was Jesus Christ and He has taught that now love everybody love your enemies too. It’s remedy He said was ‘Love’. and apart from ‘Love’ there is no remedy. But this ‘Love’ is the ‘Love’ of Param Chaitanya. He said clearly,’Seek yourself’. knock the door and the door will open ! It doesn’t mean that you go and knock the door. It means open the doors of your heart. A peson whose heart is small those who are misers that person can never be a Sahajyogi. And another thing which is very important if you get angry it means that you have too much ego. I have seen absolutely angry volatile people And they feel elated saying,’I am a very angry person’. Such people cannot be in Sahajyoga. Those who know to ‘Love’ and that too ‘Pure Love’ and that too such ‘Love’ where there is no expectation no desire those who completely know to love selflessly only they can be in Sahajyoga. Egoistic people do wrong acts. I am tired of them. They will start something on their own and they won’t even tell me. and by doing so Today thousands of questions have risen Today it is worth saying that in Delhi once they on the day of some puja hurriedly told me that we are getting land only this much. How much did we charge ? How is that going to be ? How is the land ? Nothing ! And no Sahajyogi told me. Because if tomorrow somebody says, ‘Mataji has said so’ leave that person. If I have to say something, I will tell myself. After that we had so many meetings, I didn’t say anything. Now those who have given them money are holding their heads that they have been cheated ! How to get back that money ? Without asking Me all the work Absolutely without asking Me. The land is so bad that they have received a notice that you cannot construct anything here. On the contrary you will be arrested Every Sahajyogi has right to tell Me and ask Me they made a society of their own and became mad that they are getting land It is such a bad land It is said that you cannot grow even a chicken Are the Sahajyogis even worst than chickens ? Now whatever has happened is foolishness ! and for that I am not responsible. But you ask for your money back. It is none of My resposibility. Jesus Christ had said that those people make houses live in houses they should watch birds he makes his own [GHARONDA] with how much love they make a small one for their ownself and when they make their home they feel a great joy in constructing that home He explained it in every way that you give up attatchment. This is my house. This is my land. They are my children. Even this much that it is my country. This attatchment should be given up. Then only you can be great. In the whole world you are brothers and sisters. It doesn’t mean that you give up devotion to your country. Not at all ! If you are not devoted to your country you can’t do anything. Within you there should be devotion to country. But the same devotee to country becomes devoted to the world. If there is no devotion to one’s country if there is no drop, how can there be a sea ? first of all whether there is devotion to country, is to be seen first of all. If you are working against your country you are not devoted to it. Jesus Christ had no need to go back. He had said also That there live such people Those who have the desire of only [MAL] are [MALECH] But Shalivahana told Him, ‘No ! No 1 you go’. ‘ And teach them [NIRMAL TATTWA] the principle of purity. He went to teach them [NIRMAL TATTWAM] and they put an end to His life. It is mad people’s country. He didn’t need to learn anything. But had to teach something. That is why He went there. and for the same reason His end was this way. But ‘Wiseness’ and ‘Forgiveness’ ‘Forgiveness’ is the only mantra which can open Agnya chakra. If against anyone you have any ill feeling against anyone anger or if there is a tendency to be violent against anyone your Agnya cannot be up to the mark. Whatever you have to do you have to do with love. Even if you have to say something to anyone you have to say so that his life becomes ‘NIRMAL’. It doesn’t mean that you spoil your children. To children you have to perfectly discipline If you cannot discipline children your children can never be good Sahajyogis. And for that you must be yourself disciplined. If you are not disciplined yourself you cannot discipline your children. About Jesus Christ’s life very little was written. But He was so disciplined In this way tolerated and from His life He showed He didn’t need to be married He didn’t marry It doesn’t mean that He was against marriage. People have such wrong notions And that is why they have self made notions the women who are called ‘NUNS’ were married to Jesus Christ He was Sakhshat Ganesha ! How can anyone be married to Him ? Apart from that Men also no to marry such unnatural/ uncultural concepts were taught.............. With that everyone can be kept under control but one cannot become Christian. like such [KRITRIM BANDHAN] to cover oneself today Chritian religion is losing its importance. They forgot Jesus ! and created a religion out of their own and call it Chritian religion. The Christian religion of today Looks like a blot on the name of Jesus ! Because I was born in this religion I saw the ins and outs of this religion. The same is the case with Hindu religion. In Hindu religion you cannot be communal at all. Because your various gurus, real gurus like Datatreya etc., and Nathpanthies are your many incarnations and your Sayambus are many. You don’t have one book. You have number of books. Only Jesus and Bible They can be fundamentalists. And they can be Yahudis also And all the three are related to each other. It is written in books. But a Hindu can never be communal. Because some have some guru and others a different guru. Some adore Mahalaxmi. Others Renuka Devi. Some to Krishna. So, every person every family individually adore incarnation, books. As such there is no book which can be called as Holy Bible. So to all the religions a Hindu should pay respect. The capacity of paying respect is maximum in Hindus. Once we were in a hotel, there was a Bible. They keep a Bible [IN THE ROOM] whether somebody reads or not. That Bible fell on the floor. There was one Hindu with us. He picked up The Bible, put It on his head and then on the table. They will never touch The Bible with their feet. The Christians will do so. A Hindu will never do so. To respect everybody is Hindu’s Dharma. But those who have come out of it are very very strange. Those who are our politicians such people have taken birth Asmushrooms come out in monsoon same way some people have come out. But they are not Hindus. They don’t know anything about their [DHARMA] religion. North Indians don’t know it at all. and those who are South Indians They know that bramhins have to be given money here and there have to do this and that [RITUALS]. In this Maharashtra there is nothing else than karmakand. They are so karmakandi. In Maharashtra I have worked very hard. Everything was waste. Because they are very ritualistic [KARMAKANDI]. They cannot give it up. Here is the temple of Siddhi Vinayak The Ganeshji that is there I have awakened that. Now what do I see that there one mile long long lines one mile long are standing on Tuesday. Gneshji too must have slept. The ritualistic people of this type are in Maharashtra. Because of that Karmakand their temprament has become hot. And in North India also I have seen that some people are Karmakandi. And those who are Karmakandi they have lot of anger, are hot tempered. And those who are not in Karmakand are very cool. So the first thing is Stop ritualism. But respect everything. Stopping ritualism doesn’t mean to kick everything. This balancing was taught by Jesus Christ. Without this balance your Agnya Chakra cannot open. Everbody’s respect and unnecessary ritualism in which wrong people are growing Now a day’s false gurus They exist because of ritualism [KARMAKAND]. They will say you give so much money, do this do that. Do Havana 108 times daily read these names, those names giving you mantras doing this that These are Karmakandis and teach you Karmakand. Completely against which is Jesus Christ. Which He knew that by doing Karmakand a human being becomes egoistic. and to crack this ego To Karmakand He had forbidden tottaly. had forbidden totally. The same way, in the name of God anyone earning money was objectionable to Him. On the contrary reverse process started. Earn money and consume. They don’t give up earning but [believe to] earn money and consume. It doesn’t solve any problem. Today in Sahajyoga work We should remember how much money we paid for Sahajyoga work. How much money did we give? Jesus Christ had twelve fish killers. Even they spread in the whole world by working hard. Today you are so many disciples of mine. And if you want you can give realisation to so many people. Can introduce so many people to Sahajyoga. But the people should not be half baked. They should be deep. Unless they are deep, they cannot understand. And for that the greatest thing is that how much we love them. And how much love they give to others. Anyone who is a leader in Sahajyoga he should remember first of all that the teaching of Jesus Christ to love everybody Am i doing that ? I shower my anger over everyone. I keep everybody under control I express my anger with my eyes. This ego is very much not only against Sahajyoga but his destructor Whosoever is egoistic should lessen it and replace it with love Life will be a pleasure. Life will be beautiful ! If you don’t know how to love then for a few days you come out of Sahajyoga. First you open the doors of your heart. With that only With its Shakti only Sahajyoga will spread. The question is that those who spread Sahajyoga they have the Shakti [Power] of love less and the Shakti of anger more. It will never spread. With love it will spread And with anger it will minimise and diminish. The teaching of Jesus is necessary for us to understand. Sorry I had to talk in Hindi language because most of the people here are Indians Some of them are Marathis and others are from North India. I was telling them about Christ. What was His power ? His power was of ‘Love’. And not of anger Because He is the one who has crossed the most difficult center of Agnya. Those people who have ego never realise they have ego With their ego they do all kinds of nonsensical things. Without asking Me they have done something in Delhi. Without asking me they have done something in Russia. And it is so destructive to Sahajyoga. that they don’t realise what they have done is the crime which is punishable by all Divine laws. If you want to do anything you must tell me beforehand. You must consult Me you must talk to Me Because I know what is happening. You don’t know if somebody wants to cheat you. Then how will you know if you were so sensitive you would find out You would have asked Me, ‘Mother what should we do ?’ At least ask Me. This is the main thing missing among Sahajyogis now that we have a kind of a very subtle ego. If you make somebody a leader it is very dangerous sometimes if the leader developes ego because of his wife. It is a very difficult thing. They can destroy Sahajyoga completely. Anything is possible. So before you do anything like that you have to consult [Me]. I am still living and you can ask You can write to Me, you can telephone too. Atleast I am there to tell you but then you have to develop your balance and your love.

抱歉我必须讲印地语,因为这里大多数人都是印度人,他们有些是马拉地人(Marathis),还有一些人来自印度北部。

我要告诉他们关于基督的事情。基督的力量是什么?祂的力量是爱而不是愤怒。因为是祂穿过了额轮这个最困难的中心。

那些自我取向的人从未意识到自己的自我。他们带着自我做了各种荒谬的事情。没询问我他们就在德里做了些事,没询问我他们就在俄罗斯做了些事;这对霎哈嘉瑜伽而言,是如此具有破坏性,而他们不知道自己的所作所为是犯罪,是要受到所有的上天律法惩罚的。如果你想做什么事,一定要事先告诉我,你一定要咨询我,你必须和我谈谈,因为我知道正在发生着什么。而你不知道,假如某人想欺骗你,你怎么会知道呢?除非你很敏感,你才会查明。所以,你要问问我,至少需要问问我:“母亲我们该怎么做?”,现在在霎哈嘉瑜伽士中,这是最主要的缺失——我们有种非常精微的自我。如果你让某人当领袖,有时会很危险,如果领袖因为妻子的缘故而发展出自我,这是一件非常麻烦的事情,他们会完全毁了霎哈嘉瑜伽——任何事都是有可能发生的。

所以在做任何类似的事之前,你要咨询我,我还活着,你可以问我,你可以写信给我,你可以打电话给我。至少我会告诉你。然后你要发展出你的平衡和你的爱。这只有透过Paramachaitanya,藉由这个无所不在的上天浩爱的力量,你才发展出明辨力,你发展出那些特别的力量。有人仅是打电话给我,我马上就能知道这个人有什么问题。我不是说你会变成像我一样,但至少你有生命能量去检验。也检验一下你自己的生命能量,你进展如何?放一张纸在你手上,你会看到它在我的照片前开始抖动。而自我一旦发展,带着这个自我你无法进步。

你为什么来霎哈嘉瑜伽?你来这不是为了成为领袖或国王那类的人,你来这里是为了成为一名伟大的导师——正如你们向我请求的那样——Gurupada dijiye。为此,在霎哈嘉瑜伽中,你必须要有完全的谦卑、自然的谦卑、自然的平衡——这就是基督教导我们的。

那个时代,我不认为人们有很多的自我,自我是现代的产物。人们从任何事中获得自我。例如,我曾遇到过一位女士,我发现她的自我很糟。我说她怎么回事?接着我问我的女儿们,她是做什么的?她们说,妈妈,她知道怎样制作玩偶。因此她有自我。有什么比成为一个优秀的霎哈嘉瑜伽士更伟大呢?你或许是个国王,你或许是个什么人物。现在你看看那些总理们,他们所有人都进了监狱。他们怎么能与你们相比?他们没有平衡,他们没有知觉。

是什么让你们成为了与众不同的个体 —— 更高的人类?是因为你们没有自我!

现在人们努力地去除他们的自我,有两种类型。他们会持续鞋打他们自己,并且做各种仪式主义的事情去除他们的自我。可是所有这些事情都是用思维去做,这只会带给他们自我。他们变成苦行者,他们是最大的自我主义者。我必须要说,希特勒是最大的苦行者,借由他的苦行主义他成为希特勒。如果你想变成希特勒你就变成苦行者。在霎哈嘉瑜伽中,你根本不被允许做所有苦行。你必须富有爱心、亲切、善良和自律。我必须强调的是,某些时候当你充满爱心时,由于你没有通晓霎哈嘉瑜伽的纪律,你就会越界。爱并不是说你要变成罗密欧和朱丽叶那样,不是这个意思。你必须通过纪律达到平衡。如果你没有纪律你永远也不会成为一个好的霎哈嘉瑜伽士。从基督的一生中,我们必须学会这些 ——除非我们拥有这种特质,否则我们不可能成为一个好的霎哈嘉瑜伽士。

首先是仪式主义的本性,第二是愤怒,第三是吝啬。比如你去英国,那里乘计程车要付英磅。这就是吝啬的实例,整天想着我们在哪里可以省钱,“母亲,您可以给优惠吗?”,“如果您收半价许多人会来”!类似的事情。我在这里不是做什么生意,我自己没有用你们的钱,我把所有得到的钱用于建造供你们用的房子。当然,这些钱有我的也有你们的。我成就了很多事情,所有这些我已经做到——整个VASHI,所有的静室,在德里有两个静室,以及整个学校,还有在浦內(Pune)和其他地方的土地。

现在在浦內(Pune),他们希望我付土地费,为所有事情付费。浦內人是马哈拉施特拉邦人(Maharastrians),这里的人众所周知非常吝啬,喜欢耍阴谋(译注,英文稿为conjurish, 疑为conjuresed)。甚至他们自己的静室,他们也希望我来付费,为所有的一切付费,然后他们再舒服地去唱拜赞歌,你看,他们都是所谓的好音乐家,但他们也是非常非常小气的人。吝啬的人永远不会爱,他们只热爱钱。利己主义的人永远不会爱,他们只爱那控制他人的力量。

他们认为自己是为霎哈嘉瑜伽这样做,但并非如此。除非你改善自己和去除你的自我,否则为霎哈嘉瑜伽工作是没用的。看看基督,祂出生在一个非常简陋的住所。虽然祂就是国王,可祂和穷人住在一起,并努力解救他们。祂救了麻风病人,祂救了很多人,有21个人被祂治好了。

现在在霎哈嘉瑜伽,我不知道具体多少,数以千计的人已被治愈。但重要的是,如果你正在医治,要知道不是你在医治——是上天大能在医治,你没做任何事,这点必须要清楚明了。我也有同感,我什么也没做,我是NISHKRIYA,什么也没做 —— 但我不惰怠。你应该是活跃的,而你的所作所为应该来自上天大能的浩爱。首先,你要为爱延展双手,延展你的心,延展你的钱、房子和一切,为了爱做这些。

现在,如果你的妻子不允许其他人进家,把她扔出房子,我不在意。教她如何亲切和慷慨 ——反过来对丈夫也一样。这很重要,你必须慷慨,必须亲切,必须对他人充满爱和甜美。

基督只发过一次脾气,是当祂看到人们在庙宇里卖东西时——祂有权利那样做。我们这儿也发生过同样的事情。如果你不去他们那里买东西,他们就会消失。但你们就是要去他们那里买东西,因为你们有购物的习惯。人们去哪都一定要购物,他们必须购物这是种习惯。他们不会去看绿色植物,欣赏大自然的美,什么也不看。

你们知道,以前我隨同我的丈夫到访很多国家时,我一定会去看看那些诸如博物馆之类的美丽地方。我从不会去购物。但是当我有这么多孩子时,我就得购物了,我会去买些东西。但不会去每个地方都是为了购物。当你们为了自己的灵性成长来到这里,会有什么好买的呢?在麦加(Mecca)有什么商店吗?这是比神圣更神圣的地方。为何你们要去那些商店呢,我不能明白。我告诉他们不要开店铺,但是你们这些人支持、鼓动他们从我们这赚钱。没有什么必要在那里买。现在你们是为了神圣的时刻而来,你们来到这里是为了你们的崇拜。

在我们的摩诃拉希什米庙宇,有人卖女士扎头发用的花环及饰物,但是他们说是为女神准备的,然后真的就会有人甚至所有来的人,很愚蠢地在那里买。然后他们把花环献给庙宇里的婆罗门,婆罗门再以更低的价格卖出去。只因前往那里的人们的愚昧,这些花环我不知道被买卖、买卖了多少次。如果他们真要带些什么来,他们应当从外面买来,而不是在那个你来到的地方。当你去德里,你可以在那里买,或者你来孟买,你可以在那里买。但不是在这个地方买,我们不能把这个地方变成孟买或德里,否则我们为什么要来这里呢?这就是为什么基督打那些在教堂附近卖东西的人的原因(注:此处took a hunter没有翻译,录音听了也是这几个词,但无法找到合适的意思)。我看到如今他们没这么做了,在教堂附近他们没有这么做了,他们在外面这么做。但是他们卖别的东西。像天主教教堂会卖一种叫Benedictine的酒,你们可以想像到吗?

还有一个故事。基督去参加一个婚礼,他们没有wine;如今在希伯来语(Hebrew)中,wine是葡萄汁的意思,不意味着是发酵过的。因此祂把水转化成了那种葡萄汁。你不可能把水瞬间转化成酒,酒必须得腐烂,得有气味,气味越浓越好。但是他们认为基督说你必须喝酒,你看。祂从来没有那样说,祂仅仅把水转化成wine,wine的意思是葡萄汁。

有一次在意大利我去做电视节目,有一位好男士。他说:“母亲,您先给我自觉吧。”于是我说,“拿些水来。”我把手放进去。“现在你喝下它。”他说味道像葡萄汁(wine)。我说,“这就是基督所做的。”就这样他得到了他的自觉。

你不可能瞬间酿制出酒。然而如果有人死了,他们会喝酒,如果有人出生了,他们也会喝酒。不惜任何代价,不喝酒他们就不正常。但得到自觉的人会突然改变,他们不想喝酒,他们停止了喝酒,他们的注意力变好,整个事情都改变了。这就是转化所成就的,也是基督所谈过的,默罕默德所谈过的,每个人都谈到过这个人们会得到转化的特殊时刻。

但即使在转化后,你还是不想成为你必须要成为的样子,你们是为此而来到这里的,这样的话你将会被淘汰。这个大转化正在发生,在这个转化中你也在升进。一个大的进化正在进行,那些无法妥善进化的人会被淘汰。正如传说那样这是最后的审判,你会被审判,你会被淘汰,因为你的重量你会掉下去,你无法追隨那些升进得较高的人。

所以对你而言要理解基督,就是你要具备祂的所有特质。如果你还是脾气暴躁,好吧,去鞋打你自己,但若你不是这样就不必做鞋打。你必须知道自己是怎样的。首先,你要內省然后去解決,但形式主义在霎哈嘉瑜伽里永远不被允许。我喜欢我所有的孩子都富有爱心和集体意识,不会平白无故地谴责任何人,如果你必须公开指责你应该告诉我,我知道是怎么回事。没问过我你不可以评价任何人,也不可以说我已经评价过某人,你用什么评价呢?你的标准是什么?你自己还被束缚在自我的罗网中。没告诉我之前你不能谴责任何人。你必须告诉我,不用担心会打扰我或其他什么,你本该问我。我了解每个人,也许我没见过那个人,但是我能感知到生命能量。

你们可以写信给我。很多人只是打电话,那不是办法,你们必须写信给我,因为我会读每一封信。但是你们不要写任何荒谬的信来浪费我的时间 —— 比如我爸爸、我妈妈或这个人病了、死了,她的亡灵在游走等等。各种可笑的信件都寄给我,对这些人我能做什么呢?那是不重要的。又或者是,我没钱,我需要钱,我在金钱上指望您,请您寄钱给我。你可以对着我的照片请求。如果你是一个好的霎哈嘉瑜伽士,你也不必担心钱。或者我没孩子,母亲,该怎么办?我想有个孩子。问问那些有孩子的人,看他们说些什么?

很多人来到霎哈嘉瑜伽后有了孩子,但你必须是配得到的。很多奇迹已发生,很多人被治愈,这毫无疑问。但那并不表示你已经做到了,不要掉进自我的陷阱,那是最危险的。如果你破坏霎哈嘉瑜伽,那你就是在毁灭自己。

所以今天,你们必须在心里承诺,把手放在你们的心脏上说,“母亲,我们会去爱,我们会传播您上天的爱并让爱环绕整个世界,给所有人自觉。我们不会咆哮,不会发怒,我们不会做各种仪式,而只是交托,交托我们的自我给您。”

交托它,交托你的自我,所有的问题都能被解決。因为只要有自我,这上天的力量就无法接管,你做任何事时没有连接,连接会消失。基督会消失,祂不再在那里。要建立祂首要的是你必须展示你是如何去爱的,那并不意味着你只爱你的妻子、你的孩子和你的房子。

你必须爱每一个人。努力让每个人高兴。这就是为何我喜欢音乐,因为通过音乐能散播生命能量,这是非常好的媒介来散播生命能量,爱的能量。但那些音乐家们必须是有爱心的人,不会脾气暴躁,不炫耀,不过分为自己着想。如果我们明白上天的力量是如此强大,所有这些都会成就得非常好。这就是爱,这就是真理,这是毫无疑问的。如果你脱离祂,你会被任何东西逮住,你可能会被毁掉。这是一种你自己內在拥有的,非常非常强有力的、有效的、绝对决定性的力量。感谢基督,祂被钉死在十字架上,为我们牺牲了祂的身体,我们的额轮因此被打开 —— 否则我不可能完成这霎哈嘉瑜伽。但是在这个区域(母亲指着前额)我们有佛陀、基督、大雄(Mahavira),祂们都得做tapasya、tapaha(苦行),祂们已经做过了,如今你们不需要做,祂们已经为你们做了。

昨天我见到了音乐家们,在两三个月的时间里他们学会了这么多,而之前我认识的所有学印度音乐的音乐家,他们不得不一起挨饿数月,在一起练习,必须一起服从于他们的导师数年。现在那一切都结束了,是因为这个上天无所不在的力量,而你的力量与上天合而为一了。这个上天的力量能完全地转化你,并且达到这样一种程度:任何你想做的事情,你能在两三个月內做到。

在浦內(Pune),有一次,一些外国人在唱歌——我们就是这么称呼他们以示尊重。在印度,外国人的称呼意味着尊重他们,跟其他国家不同。他们正在歌唱,到场的有一些非常杰出的音乐家,他们告诉我,“母亲,我们真得向他们鞠躬致敬,因为这些人根本不懂得印度音乐的一个字,他们怎么能学得那么好?”马拉地语的发音非常难,他们却那么擅长,真让人吃惊。现在这些都在你面前发生,在你面前发生。

很不错你们有很多气球来庆祝基督的生日,而在你们脑袋里的所有这些自我的气球,都应该爆掉,应该结束了。

如果你们能学印地语我会很高兴 —— 我知道我的英语可能不太好 —— 最好是能学印地语,如果可能的话。因为在印度已经有14种语言,在其他国家也有很多种语言。每个国家都有一套不同类型的英语语言。如果你去美国,至少有两三天我听不懂他们的英语,因为他们用他们的方式讲话,他们的嘴唇在一边,然后再到另一边。法国的英语呢,就是另外一个样子。所以最好是学印地语,学好的印地语,不是梵语化的印地语,比如他们说“Roz-marrah”——日常的印地语,假如你们都能明白我所说的,我会感觉更好,这不会很难,因为你们都是霎哈嘉瑜伽士,你能很快学会印地语。

我不是说学梵文,但是印地语是很简单的。它不是我的母语,我从未学过印地语,从来没有,但是你看它是很容易学的语言。当我的父亲告诉我,永远不要教英国人学印地语,我问为何有这样的建议?他说,「有个英国人追着我要学印地语,他说我得告诉我的仆人去开门或关门。」所以,开门呢,他说你要说「there was a cold day(天气很冷),」就是Warwaza khol dey;而关门呢,你要说「there was a banker(有一位银行家),」就是Warwaza band kar。但是现在不同了。他们能很快学懂印地语,非常快,我知道。如果他们能那么容易的学这种可怕的很难学的印度古典音乐,那么结果会怎样呢?他们可以很快学会印地语让我更高兴。不是因为印地语是我的母语,不是的,马拉地语是我的母语。但是马拉地语很难,我想你们学不会,它是很精确的。

我想马拉地语是让你放下自我最好的语言之一。这就是为何马哈拉施特拉邦人通常不会自我取向的原因,因为在说这种语言的过程中有一种美感。举例说,有人在吹嘘:我做过这个,我做过那个。在马拉地语中,他们会说,不要去爬灌木丛,或者你们称为CHANNA一种那么巨大的树, 然后那个人就不说话了。像这样有很多成语可以当着那个人的面说让他放下自我。所以马拉地语有很多优势,不过我不会要求你们学习马拉地语,那并不容易学,但是你要学印地语,它很容易,非常容易。

但是有一件事你必须要知道,印地语里有adab的方式。adab的意思是谦虚、尊重 —— 尊重,但是比尊重更多,它是一种说话的风格。不是乌尔都语(Urdu),而是印地语的日常交谈,带有尊重的一种与他人说话的方式。这方式会给你一种更灵活的工具来表达你的爱。因为在印地语中我们从不会说我恨你;你不可以这么说。恨某人是有罪的,所以他们从不说我恨你。「贞洁」在马拉地语中有更多的意思,但是因为它有较多的意思,所以有点难学。比如我告诉你们的那种可以当场纠正你的成语。

所有的这些只是请求你,如果你能学会这种非常难学的音乐,你可以隨时学这种非常非常简单的、非常非常容易说的印地语。

我希望你们能了解关于基督的许多事,但时间太短我没法都告诉你们,祂有祂自己的优先任务。尽管圣经中没有完全地描述祂,我得说,不管在圣经中写了什么,或许他们刪减掉了。他们实践基督教的方式也令人震惊。你必须用心学习基督教义,别无他法,他们应该通过你们母亲的心来用心学习。

愿上帝祝福你们所有人!

后面內容是录音內容。

我告诉了他们关于女人的力量,男人不能没有女人,她是背后的力量。但重要的是你如何对待你的Shaktis(力量),你如何照顾你的妻子,这非常重要。我告诉他们西方的情況:婚姻破裂,家庭破裂,孩子无家可归,丝毫没有纪律,没有任何的纪律。你无法拯救这种孩子,明天他们可能就会......

通常,在讲座之后,我会给人们带自觉 —— 但是你们都已得了自觉。你们可以举起手自己感觉看看是否有凉风 —— 面对你自己,如果有什么问题,你必须要纠正它。

If there is something wrong you must get it corrected. Better, better. Ta puja kara! (marathi: So let’s do the puja). Good!

讲话结束。
