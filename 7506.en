Today I just thought that there are quite a lot of people who come for the first time. And I should tell them about the significance of Puja. Because as the western style of life is that meant to be like this. To seek something outside, to go outside, find out new ways and methods to grow outside. Now this is the knowledge of your roots. Knowledge, through which you receive your nourishment, is not known to you before. This knowledge was not known to you before and was not deliberately told because you are supposed to grow outside. Now when you have to go inside then you have to understand the divine laws and divine methods how it works out. The pujan has the significance from ancient times, the saints described them. Because in India the whole climate is such that you can live under a tree, live in a forest no problem, then eat fruits and very happily you could be in a forest. There is no need to have bed or anything; it is so warm and nice, and then always enjoy the bliss of a forest and thus many people went to live in forest and started thinking, looking at whole world from that solitude, what is the problem with human being? Why are we here? What should we do? What is the purpose of this human life? Why God have given us this beautiful human life? This time there where thinking about it. That is how they went to meditative position, meditative entry within themselves. And when they started meditating they found out, all about Kundalini, about chakras and deities that resided on them. These deities have resided from eternal times; we can say in the abode of God, they have all resided there and then they were reflected on this earth and they incarnated just to give us a better and better awareness.

We could have avoided all this. It could have been very easy if we had listened to god at the time of Adam and Eve. At the time of Adam and Eve, it was told that you should not eat the fruit of knowledge. Now, that was not the fruit of the true knowledge, but the fruit of knowledge was the knowledge about the matter, knowledge about things. So, as you know, the story is, satanic forces worked, they nude both of them and they started developing themselves on the other side. That is how you made a mistake. That is why it is called as original sin. And that original sin has brought us to this brain. Now, and we have to go back. We have to go back within ourselves to find our roots. And that is why to improve on their mistakes and to improve on their ignorance that is how the first ignorance was setting. The darkness of ignorance was setting because of that mistake. And then from darkness we need to come to human stage. And when we need to come to human stage we have to pass through all that different various stage of life where incarnations have to take place. So, as now as you know very well, we have incarnation placed in our centres which are not yet awakened. That means they are not in our attention. They are not to be felt in our central nervous system or we cannot fill them on our finger tips, to be very very simple. So they are there but they are not acting according to our desire. We do not know them and they do not listen to us. They do what is right for them or what they think is proper. You do not have any connection with them so far. So the first thing is to connect yourself with those different stages through which you have passed.

First as you know is the Ganesha’s stage, is the innocence. Innocence, the formless of innocence was made into Shri Ganesha because some nucleus has to emit that innocence. In the whole world there are eight such creations of the mother earth and luckily they are in Maharastra. You will find Maharastrian people on the whole are innocent compared to others, they are rather innocent in nature because the reason is from mother earth innocence is emitted. So the first thing is that within us to establish innocence we have to worship Shri Ganesha. When you worship me as Shri Ganesha, Ganesha within you is awakened. You see the result of that. So the people, who are suffering, say from the trouble all these perversions, these modern diseases that have come, must establish their Shri Ganesha. If they can not establish their Shri Ganesha they cannot be cured. So their innocence has to be first established. If he can not establish their innocence we cannot cure them. First and foremost thing is to establish Shri Ganesha. And Shri Ganesha is made out of the mother earth element. So by praying to Shri Ganesha we also establish it in a sitting in a place like this place now is San Francisco where I came here first we had no Puja, nothing and that is why the whole thing was just touch and go. I can not go deep into people; I could not go deep into the place and so the I did not know how I will able to mange because, there is no education on this. People are not educated about. But in India immediately the first thing is Puja. They will not come to my lecture, they will not come to anything, first is Puja. .If there is a Puja everybody is getting up at 4 o clock, having a bath, getting ready for Puja. Because they know the importance of it that you does just. Your essence is awakened by it, essence is awakened. And to awaken the essence you have to be there at a place where this is done so that your essence is awakened.

But the trouble is with ego oriented society is very difficult to tell them about Puja. We find it difficult. So that is why we don’t allow everybody to come for Puja for one reason because as soon as they see something happening, their ego comes up, you see, instead of doing anything to them Barrier is so much I cannot just do anything about. But barrier is too much in their ego, they have their own idea, their own conception, their own filthy game and it is impossible to penetrate deep into them, so it is a waste. And if you cannot receive the vibration I feel the pain in my own centres. Because the deities you see get so annoyed they don’t like it and they think that why mother should waste their energy with this people who do not understand about Puja. So I want to prepare you before hand that you keep yourself open. Don’t allow your ego to come up. It is nothing for me to gain. It is for you to gain. Keep your minds open. The Trouble is that at the time of Sahasrara opening is everybody’s brain is upside down. It is impossible, you try to tell it and they will jump on you. It is the big problem for me; it is the biggest problem for me. Because, all other incarnations came they did not have to do this difficult work of making you something. Just it was to awaken within you a awareness, like Christ had to awaken your Agyna Charka. Alright, he crucified himself for the same reason, he resurrected for the same reason. It was a very hard life for him and for the mother it was even worse, No doubt. But still, one should know that this is a very hazardous thing to transform people and then to established them and create out of this little seeds a huge big tree of a saint. Now, in the same way, we got Moses, we got Abraham all these great saints are within our, are in our void. They are the gurus. And On a Guru Puja, you worship me on the guru Puja day that time these are awakened within you and you become a master, you become yourself a Guru. You yourself know so much even I do not have to tell you, I do not think I have talked to people very much in private, or explain to things but some how they become so much full of knowledge that is rather surprising how they understand like I was talking to yogi Mahajan and he was telling me what is the problem is with human being and a you see, he was telling me how we cannot relate to them and know it was very interesting. Because My father did same to me. I said that he is my first guru and all of you my second guru. Because I do not understand human beings, see for example, this homo sexual business, when Gregoire , with very great reluctance you see, told me through somebody else, I was fainted I could not understand what is happened to them, now what I have to do and I could not eat my food for one week. I felts so bad about the whole thing like My own children [nor clear]..If you have a heart of intense mother you can understand what you feel about it. And I knew they are in trouble, I knew is going to be very very hazardous but does not matter. By God’s grace everything will work out. I am sure it will work out.

So first we have to establish Shri Ganesha. First of all we have to establish Shri Ganesha within ourselves and Shri Ganesha in this place called San Francisco, alright. That is why we have to first do Shri Ganesha’s Puja and then secondly I told him that if possible we should do little bit of Shri Vishnu’s because he is a one who gives us the evolutionary power by which we can evolve ourselves and evolve others. So we have a little time for Shri Vishnu’s Puja. Also they do Havanas and all that for Shri Vishnu’s Puja which is very good to clear the atmosphere sort of thing. But we will do next year only all this thing perhaps may be as we do not have this arrangements, but that should be very good idea too. And Then the thirdly they want to do the Puja of Shakti, the mother earth. Because unless and until you have power, even if all the deities are there you will be exhausted you would not able to work it out. So the third is of your own power, of your Kundalini, of the power that is going to work out this divine work. That is how we have three Pujas.

But none of you should get in to an ego trip. Please keep your ego on one side. Just now see for yourself how it works within your self. You start feeling good, you start feeling better vibrations and you start feeling much better and healthier within yourself. So, just keep your self open. It is you who has to achieve something, not me! I do not have to achieve anything. So you better make use of me. Because I am here only for today and then I will go away. So make best use of me and that is why I said as many as possible try to call people over here will be a good idea.

May God Bless you all.

So the first is, the Ganesha Puja at that time they wash my feet, you see. Ganesha is the devotee only of mother not of father. He is only worried about his mother and he will worship the mother and once the mother said, alright. He had another brother, who was Kartikeya, who was a, one who was created specially to kill one rakshasha and who goes on a peacock while Ganesha has got a simple little mouse as his conveyance to shows that he has no ego, he does not need any [?] .he need just a little mouse, the smallest animal that he is uses for. There are very symbolic things.. There are many lectures of mine in which you will learn about him. So this Shri Ganesha, you see, when you respect, when we are worshipping, him we have to be very humble He has just very ordinary mouse as his conveyance. And his mother was told that anyone who goes round the world and comes first, we have to give them a present. And the both of them thought it is good idea. But Shri Ganesha thought then this one Kartikeya is very fast one. He will go on his peacock, flying all over and I can not compete with him and he is a, he is the embodiment of wisdom. He said who is greater then my mother? So he went around his mother only three times and he got the prize. Still the other fellow going round somewhere else because that is the fact and she gave him a prize. That is what it is. That one has to understand that mother’s dedication is much more beneficial than any other dedication because she does not want anything. Because she is so dedicated to you that you achieve the best from her only. She will go on giving giving giving giving giving. The more you ask the more you will have more the more you wanted that more she will give you. So it is better to depend on a source which is all the time available to you and it is very gentle and kind and affectionate and loving. So it is better to depend on some one like that then to depend on any guru who might hit you hard or do something or make you stand upside down and the father who can be very wrathful, sometimes you know, the father is all the time waiting just to destroy the world. And you have to ask him just wait, just wait just wait. [All Laughing]. Is a Father can be very wrathful, very wrathful, destroy.

[Shri Mataji talking to yogis]

So now, some thing I got for your. I hope you have shown them, a presents for the centre, I brought this one for the centre here, and I hope, this also, this one. As a present I will give it to someone for [?], you can take it.

May god bless you.

In India, I can get many more things better suited for Puja. But, when you come next time you can get real silver. [not clear].

This is a nice thing you got from India. But this you must get for every centre. Now they are carrying all over, you all can get it and we should send them, to all centres. It is every easy from Delhi we got it.

Now, those who have never washed my feet should wash my feet today and those who have washed for many times should not wash. [All Laughing], [not clear] He very nicely asked me, “Should we all wash”. I said, “No” [All Laughing], alright. There is a competition in India you see and some people try to cheat.

Yogi: We say the Mantras, Shri Mataji?

Shri Mataji: Sindoor lagao.

Now, this is, this one is something now very red, you know enhance the wavelength which can be seen by anyone , fastest as it has such a short wavelength. They say It can pass through [not clear] ..That is why this red mark they have described in bible. This red marked, it is made out of a very auspicious thing and then burnt into this colour. This is the colour of Shri Ganesha. And if you put it in night before sleeping on your forehead, if you are possessed, the possession will leave you. But it should be vibrated, it should be vibrated. Once it is vibrated it has that power. And it really clears; I will try today on some of you because it clears completely your head, makes it properly.

Because he is going to say mantra, [I am putting this for you]. All this have significance only if it is vibrated. Without vibration it is empty rituals.

[To Yogi], See, lag raha hai na, just screw, you know the screw, tight one is loosened, and if it loose, tight it.
You all will feel it also.
