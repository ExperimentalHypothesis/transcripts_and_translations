Interviewer: Shri Mataji, the very first days. So, would Ruth like to start, please?

Ruth: Yes. Yes, I was seeking in quite an intense way, really. I was reading about all different kinds of religions. And, yeah, I'd say I was a pretty desperate seeker. I was a very bad insomniac. I hadn't slept very much for two years. I was so tense, I think.

Basically, I moved into a house in Bristol where my husband-to-be was living in the flat above. I didn't know him then. He'd been telling all his friends about Sahaja Yoga and expecting them to be as enthusiastic as he was. And, of course, he hadn't had much response. So when he came to telling me about it, he was very laid back and didn't tell me very much. He didn't show me Shri Mataji's photograph.

But he described that it was something within us through which we could feel our own inner state, and also that it was collective and we could feel the state of other people. And not only that, but that we could actually put that right. I remember thinking, "Well, what else is there? If that's true, then that's it."

He told me about the meetings in London at Caxton Hall where Shri Mataji was. I didn't tell him because I wanted to go to the meeting on my own. I didn't want to have that feeling that he was watching me and seeing what my response would be. So I went without telling him. I had a very deep experience at that first meeting with Shri Mataji and just went back and said, "I'd met Shri Mataji, and I'm going to do it." And he nearly went through the ceiling because he was so surprised; everybody else he'd been telling had not had that kind of reaction. But I was seeking very much.

Interviewer: What was it like when you met Mataji? You said you had a very intense experience.

Ruth: Well, I remember sitting waiting for Shri Mataji to come into the hall. And it was only then, really, that I started to think, "What is it? Who is this person that I'm waiting to see?" And this intense feeling of expectation. And suddenly everybody rose to their feet and Mother walked in. I remember she was much smaller than I expected because I suppose I imagined someone much bigger.

Shri Mataji talked for about an hour, I suppose, quite a long talk. I just remember feeling that everything that she said made such sense. It was such common sense and just resonated so much in me. Then at the end of her talk, she said, "Right now, it's not about talking. It's about the experience. So, shut your eyes and put your hands out towards me."

As soon as I did that, I felt this incredible thump, thump, thump up my spine. I didn't really know very much about Kundalini or anything, so I didn't know what to expect. And I just knew something amazing had happened because, obviously, it was a very definite experience.

Then afterwards, Shri Mataji was in an incredibly motherly mood that night, which was very good for me because I had a quite a difficult relationship with my own mother. She was in this incredibly loving mood, just pouring out love, with her arms open and moving amongst everybody. It was very biblical in a way. I remember having this feeling that I just wanted to touch any part of her, even her sari. Afterwards, I thought, "Gosh, I've never had that feeling about anybody before." And I recognized that as something very special, that I had that instinct.

Just the feeling that I'd never seen love like that before. And I knew that I was seeing a love which was just... just beyond. Yeah, just special.

Interviewer: Would you like to share your experience?
