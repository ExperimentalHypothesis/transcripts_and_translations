Devi Puja, Burj 2000, Sharjah (United Arab Emirates), April 21st, 2001, (poor sound)

You all have been waiting here but you all but I didn’t know about your program that you were going to be here. And I had to finish something today.It’s all right. I have seen Sahaja Yogis when they have to wait, they are more together, they are more collective and they enjoy much more. So, it is not that they’ll feel angry or boring. I’ve seen in many cases, if the plane is late, they would all be there, nicely seated, [inaudible] enjoying, laughing, even if it is late by four hours, five hours, doesn’t matter.There is no passport [inaudible] in our hands. We are in the ocean of Vishwa Nirmala Dharma. So, whatever we have is all nothing but joy, out of this ocean of love.

So, we are already in the ocean of love. And we are enjoying the bliss of that. I know they are some misunderstanding sometimes, all kinds of things happen. But still, we progress. Despite that, you’ll progress and progress very well in every action, in every land, I’ve seen [inaudible] I was so amazed to see [inaudible] the wisdom. He says I have done it, but no [inaudible] Actually, it’s something great. So, the enthusiasm that is going on, that comes through Sahaja Yoga. But you must meditate, you must go to the intelligence? [inaudible], you must attend programs, and you must [inaudible].

Unless and until you have done this, it doesn’t work out. Many people have become something extraordinary themselves. Not only financially, otherwise, also, musicians, in all walks of life have achieved something. But one thing is there, that you have to meditate. Meditation means you go deep into yourself. Sahaja Yoga is to know yourself. Unless and until you meditate, you will not know yourself.
