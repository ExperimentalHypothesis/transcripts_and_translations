A long time ago, I was young, and I had the misfortune to find this guru in Hampstead. I went there for about 16 years. I met my best friend there, Magda, who became a Sahaja Yogi. This man was very dour. If you weren't already married, you were celibate; you weren't allowed to have any relationships with people. In a way, it was helpful because I was an actress, and it did keep me out of a lot of troubles that I could have gotten into. But anyway, I got in quite a bad state after going there for 16 years.

Then Magda, who lived in Hampstead, said, "Oh, there's a Lady Yogini coming to give a program. Let's go." I was in such a bad state, so left-sided, that I didn't go. It was on a Saturday, and Magda went with her daughter, Dania. She came back full of this lady. "Oh, she's lovely! She's got lots of flowers. She holds the babies. Everybody talks to each other." I thought it sounded wonderful.

The next week, I went to Caxton Hall, but Shri Mataji wasn't there. They sat me in the front, in front of her photograph, and I had an amazing experience. I just felt everything I feel for my own mother come up in Cinemascopeâ€”all these huge emotions that you have about your mother.

So I had this idea that Shri Mataji was going to be a little lady. "Oh, come, darling, have a cup of tea," with lots of jewelry and flowers, all friendly. I went to Caxton Hall the week after, and I was sitting right in the front, as near as I am to Brenda. Mother's chair was there, and she came in. She wasn't anything like this little lady covered in flowers, saying, "Have a cup of tea, dear." She looked like an opera star. She had a white sari on and swept in. She looked around, you know how she does sometimes? Like that.

I was having a very bad relationship with someone at the time, and the first thing she said was, "This silly woman in New York, she's wasting her life on this worthless man. She's throwing her life away." Magda was sitting next to me, and she just went... gasp. To say I was overstrung is putting it mildly. Mother looked like the epitome of intelligence. She had the most wonderful, beautiful skin, like a child. She had this garland of marigolds that she took off, and because we were sitting right there, she gave us the flowers to smell.

Then she spoke, and... well, I don't know what to say. It was just amazing. In those days, she used to get up and work on everyone. When she got to me, she put her hand on my head and went, "Oh, the clash with the world, the heat."

I went home. The next week, I still went to this other guru. I'd been going there for so long. And I thought, "Well, this isn't right." A few days later, I went to Caxton Hall again. We took a friend of ours from the other meeting, who was very rude to Mother, which was horrible. When we all got up, Mother clasped my hands and said, "Don't worry about anything. All the warmth is there. You're going to be all right."

I was far from all right, but after a few weeks, it got better. After that, I just never looked back. Eventually, I got married in Sahaj and became Mother's secretary. I spent lots of time with her. So I can never thank Mother for what she got me out of and what she's given me.
