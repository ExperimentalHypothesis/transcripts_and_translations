Shri Mataji: So, the religion should be inside. That’s Sufism. "Sufi" word comes from "safw" [clear]
Translator: Mother, mister Heming is teaching at Marmara University and teaching the interpretations of holy Quran.
Shri Mataji: Good.
Translator: Yes.
Shri Mataji: But, you see, Quran also is very much recent.

[1:08]
Translator: He is interpreting words from the Quran saying, if people want to follow the regulations of Quran, they would notice that Lakshmi [abundance] would come to them.
Shri Mataji: It’s not that way. You see.
Translator: If they would believe and would not break the rules, they would see the benefits. They would notice that the doors of heaven would be opened to them and that Lakshmi would come to them.
Shri Mataji: To whom?
Translator: To the people.
Guido: To those who are following the rules, those who are strictly following the Quran.
Shri Mataji: There’s no doubt about it. But what If feel about the whole thing is that, that Quran was written after forty years of the death of Muhammad Sahib.

Shri Mataji: And also- and you cannot remember. But despite that, I find Quran is perfect. But there are many subtler things that are missing. Now, for example, Muhammad Sahib has said that he went on a white horse, through the seven heavens. Now that people don't understand. So, that is the, he has described exactly what happens when the Kundalini rises. What he says?
Translator: He says that actually, he is not travelling somewhere
Shri Mataji: No, no, no, it is within yourself. Within yourself, he crosses. Yes, but that is what is Sahaja Yoga. That is what, yes. But what has happened that because of poetry, people don't understand. And they are misinterpreting. Mainly, they are misinterpreting.
Translator: People look, are searching the religion outside, not inside.
Shri Mataji: That's the point, that's the point. But what he has said-
Translator: Sufis know that this journey is a spiritual journey.
Shri Mataji: Yes, of course. But the trouble is people don't understand and they are misled. Because people want to make money out of them. Or they want to gain some sort of a violence or something and they are just bringing a bad name to Quran initially and also to Muhammad Sahib.

Translator: He believes that people, the common people is not seeking the 'Miraj' within himself.
Shri Mataji: That’s it. That's true. That is the main thing that we talk about in Sahaja Yoga that, "You know thyself" is said in the Quran also. So, when you have not known yourself, you are not "sama" [listening to your Spirit]. Without knowing yourself, what are you surrendering to God? It's an important thing that first you know yourself. Can you believe that all religions have said the same thing? Christ has said the same, Krishna has said the same, Rama has said the same, Zoroaster has said the same thing all of them have said the same thing.
Translator: Krishna, Krishna, yes, very close to Adam to Adam's religion.
Shri Mataji: But Adam did not know "Ruh" [unsure].
Translator: He believes that the poets from that time didn't have "Ruh" either.
Shri Mataji: True, I agree. But, you see, whether it is Krishna or anyone of these people, they are all just the same. And they are building up human beings to find out about themselves. And also, Sufis are like that.

Translator: The education today is only teaching the outside, the material, not the inside.
Shri Mataji: Yes, correct. I agree with you. But outside was worked out, I don't know. But it has to be worked out inside. Because, when it is worked inside, as it is said that, "At the time of "Qiyamah" [Resurrection], your hands will speak" and they speak actually. So, by outside -
Translator: Now our hands and feet are speaking also.
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Translator: He says, "Now our hands and feet are speaking also".
Shri Mataji: Ah, that's the thing, but they are very few and they are the Sufis.
Translator: They are speaking but very few are listening.
[Laughter]
Shri Mataji: Also, you should know what do they mean, what are they saying. And that is what is explained in Sahaja Yoga. You can verify it.

Translator: He is Mevlevi by the way.
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Translator: He is from the part of Mevlevi, Mevlana.
Lady: Jalal al-Din Rumi.
Guido: Whirling dervish.
Shri Mataji: But he also didn't say how you become, how, what to do- You see, whatever he was, he was great. And he has written about his own understanding and feelings.
Translator: He should tell you about his feelings, how he became Mevlevi?
Shri Mataji: He didn't say that.
Guido: No, he says that Mevlana, he didn't explain openly how to become.
Shri Mataji: No, no, no, he didn't, he didn't.
Guido: He didn't.
Shri Mataji: I agree, what he has done, he said is- what is has talked that after becoming a Realized soul, what you think what you talk and it's like, you can say, the Chinese system of Tao, same thing, same thing. Tao also is a system in which he describes what happens to a person who is a Tao. The one who is a Realized soul, what happens to him? How he is above everything, how he works out, how he has no fear. But that is what you are saying how it is. But how to achieve it? They never told. How human beings achieve it? And that too, collectively.
Translator: The people, common people, have no desire to achieve a spiritual thing.
Shri Mataji: No, no, no. Not now. Now it's a different thing. Because the world is so much full of struggle and strike and all that. This has started.
All over the world, there are thousands of people-
Translator: During the time of Mevlana it was also very much struggle: the Moghuls were invading that land and he escaped and came to Anatolia.
Shri Mataji: But this is a special time. It's already predicted in our scriptures also. In Indian scriptures, that this is the time where people will get their Self-realization collectively.

In your Italy only, in your country only, there are so many who have got it.
Translator: He says, "Inch' Allah" [If God wants it]. He believes that the fundamentals of Islam in Turkey is the Sufism.
Shri Mataji: But one Sufi cannot make others Sufis, it's the point. But in Sahaja Yoga, we can make thousands.
Translator: He knows the point as Istanbul was only five hundred thousand people. Only the half of five hundred thousand people were Muslims at that time. They were five hundred and twenty Sufi centres.
Shri Mataji: I know, I know that's why it's so important for me. But to give it collectively and to give the pure knowledge is very important.
Guido: It's spontaneous awaking, without effort. It's not coming from the brain, it's coming from inside and it is happening in no time, like this.

In Sahaja Yoga, we don't need to do big penances, tapasya, dancing, this and that. It is just a spontaneous happening. In her presence, the Kundalini awakens, goes up and we get this enlightenment. And then the full knowledge of Muhammad, Jesus, come to us spontaneously.
Shri Mataji: Complete, absolute.

Guido: Without effort.

In thousands, all over the world, they just put the hands like this and the get awakened. You see the eyes sparkling.

Sahaja Yogi: What, Shri Mataji, he is trying to tell us is that it's not to come against what we are saying, it's just that from his knowledge,
Shri Mataji: But he is a Sufi and he is my son.
Sahaja Yogi: From his knowledge, what he thinks that it is very difficult because he doesn't know.
Shri Mataji: Ah, yes. It used to be not now
Sahaja Yogi: He says when he is educating the children in school, he is teaching them Quran, and he starts with eighty of them, and after four years he says that only eight of them come out with full understanding of what I'm telling now.
Shri Mataji: No, you go the other way round. Sahaja Yoga is the other way round. First, we make them the Sufis and then we give them the Quran.

That's the way it is.

Guido: Only after the awakening, the scriptures can be understood.
Sahaja Yogi: That’s what I try, that's what I thought.
Guido: When she gave conferences, many professors, university professors, teachers of Quran, they came to Shri Mataji and they said, "The way you explain, Shri Mataji, the Quran, it was never understood before".
Shri Mataji: Fundamentalist, so many fundamentalists.
Guido: And they were fundamentalists.
Shri Mataji: First, you give them the experience of the All-pervading Power of "Ruh". Once they get the experience, then they go deep.
Translator: Now he says, "First, open the door"
Shri Mataji: And then get it. It's correct. Correct! That's all it is.
Translator: Not every door gets opened easily. Some of them are really rustic.
Guido: But Shri Mataji has the key.
Sahaja Yogi: To all the doors.
[Laughter]

She has the master key.
Translator: He understands your mission is very high and ultimate and he hopes all the best to your mission.
Shri Mataji: He has to get many Sufis. If you want to change the world, you can't manage with one or two. Even to understand Quran or Bible or anything, you have to have that eyes.

In Sahaja Yoga also, also "vidya" [knowledge], is what are all the centres are there, what are the problems of the centres. And we have seen that people have cured physically, mentally. And also, they become what they call, thoughtlessly aware.
So, all the religions have talked about it. It's not only Quran, it's not only Bible, it's not only Gita. All the religions have said the same thing.
What she said?
Translator: She is asking, "How is it possible?"
Shri Mataji: It’s possible because God has made within us all the arrangements. He is a great organizer.
And we have within us that power that's the Mother Power which rises and pierces through your fontanelle bone area and makes you one connection with that All-pervading Power, the "Ruh".
Sahaja Yogi: Excuse-me, here in Sufism, also there is a terminology for that moment. It is called "Ana al-Haqq" [I am the Truth].
Shri Mataji: In this religion.
Sahaja Yogi: "Ana al-Haqq", saying, I am God. Saying, I am God.
Shri Mataji: I am religion.
Sahaja Yogi: I am religion, I am God.
Shri Mataji: Correct.
No, no, you become. Actually, you become.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, the Truth. I am the Truth.
Shri Mataji: You become. You don't have to have a certificate. You just become. First, your hands start speaking. You know what are these centres are within you. Every knowledge, perfect knowledge within is available.
