That, the central one [channel] is the sustaining power, means is the power by which we evolve that means we get our sustenance as it is. This sustenance that we have got as a human being, when it is to be manifested on the five elements that we have within ourselves, the source is there, but we have to reach it through its different elements. When this interchange takes place or we can say when we have to put this force outside, that is to be done through establishment of dharma on these.
Like a superimposition or you can say the connection. Like you can say, say there is sun. Sun is the source of light and the source of light has come to this earth which is created out of the five elements. So the sun's rays have to come. But when they come inside, in this move, what do they do ? They enlighten this world. But it's only possible if there is Dharma, means the light is there, the rays are there. The rays can be obstructed by many things. If the rays are obstructed, then there is a-dharma. So the source of dharma, the spreading of dharma and ultimately the manifestation onto the five elements is a complete thing that is Void. This play goes on within us. Our evolutionary power which has worked from the very beginning, from matter, when the matter got itself organized then we had carbon as tetravalent, then from carbon the life started, all this is the work of the sustaining force. Then we became human beings.
Now we have got ten dharmas within us which we have to keep alright. These are the main ten commandments. These ten commandments we have to look after. And these are looked after by the people who are the primordial masters, as you call them 'incarnations' like Raja Janaka, like Moses, like Socrates, like Nanaka, the last one was the Shirdi Sai Nath. This is the principle is there, is the primordial master. Now, there is another principle that is in there by which you receive it, this is called as the disciple principle, the primordial disciple principle, represented by the moon and the sun, presided by Buddha and Mahavira. So, this disciple element if it is not in you, you cannot receive it. But when you start getting, receiving it, this dharma gets into you and then you become the guru. You become the guru when this is completely sustained. It starts as a disciple and then ends up as a Guru. This is the Void part within us.
First of all, as the human beings are, we do not observe the first ten basic principles. In this country for example, or in the West, we have, we observe the five of them because of law. In the countries like India they observe the rest five, because of their society. So in anyway we are lacking some of them. Five are missing here or five are missing there. This is the situation of the dharma today. The gurus and the disciples they do this connection and then the matter, which is created out of five elements, get vibrated. You can enlighten the matter. When the dharma is complete you can enlighten the matter. The rituals that these people used which was called as siddhu dharmic rituals they call it dudharmic, these are the deeds of dharma, is to worship, to do Puja and to pray to God and to do all these things, prayer. All these things after some time became absolutely dead in it, because there was no Realized soul as a Guru and no Realized soul as a disciple. So it was just a joke going on, you see. It has no meaning. Supposing I tell somebody who is not Realized to give himself a bandhan, he cannot.
[Apart...]
So this Void is so important because that is how you establish your receiving [ends ? eggs?] in your being, the five elements within you, meaning the five elements that exist. In Sahaja Yoga we try the other way round stuff [Apart...] Now, what to do? This dharma is all ruined. It is. There is another way: all these elements are represented in your chakras, different chakras. So why not take the Kundalini through these chakras and enlighten the elements themselves ? Even there is no Dharma in a person you can do it. But then the Kundalini goes back to all the places which you have missed. But if you have been to some guru and you have bent your head before him, then the Kundalini stops at a point. It doesn't move it goes here, there. It just stops, it doesn't move, very difficult. You have seen the Void pulsating so badly. It just doesn't rise it always goes back into that bottomless pit as you can call it. It's always sucked into that again and again if you have not a good... so we try to remove the guru from your mind by so many ways. Deny them completely, absolutely so that they get out of your minds.
And again raise the Kundalini and from the innermost, the Brahma Nadi as they call it, the innermost Nadi, the Sushumna Nadi, otherwise you cannot reach there, from outside you go on cleansing, cleansing, cleansing until you reach there, you find you cannot pierce it. But outside cleaning helps you in one way that the Brahma Nadi becomes wider, the Nadi that is in the center of Sushumna. If you- there's less pressure then it is a wider one so for Kundalini rising there is a better chance.

But in Sahaja Yoga, subtlest of subtlest Kundalini we catch, and thread it microscopically inside and take it out. And by taking it out what happens ? These chakras definitely get enlightened, they expand. That's how we expand the Sushumna. Expending Brahmanadi. This was- this is the trick of Sahaja Yoga. Because this cleansing is going to take too much time as you say. The whole thing is to be cleansed out and then it is to be released and then you have to meet some guru who has to take it. So this Sadhachar [virtue, correct action], whatever Buddha has said, the right, the right action, the right that he has said is the one that is done. That's what it described. But that doesn't work out with human beings, it's meant for people who are realized souls. Most of these religions are meant for realized souls, you can find out. Actually realized souls only took to religion before. Those who where born again, Dwijah, Brahmins, who took to religion. But the time has come for people who are not realized also to take to religion and to receive his blessings. Sahaja Yoga is the only way one can do it, is to take it in the suttle most-inner most Nadi, enlighten every chakra, increase the size of the chakra, pierce a little bit here, then again raise another thread, then again the third thread, like that, go on expanding.
Apart: This is it, you're alright ..
Better.

This is how it works out. In our case, I did the same, I mean just talking to you.

Now the main thing about Void one has to remember : there is no rationality. It's the hunger inside the stomach and hunger has no rationality : if it is hungry it will eat. It has to eat, no rationality can satisfy it : if you are hungry, you’re hungry. And when you have spiritual hunger, the same hunger becomes subtler and subtler ultimately it becomes the spiritual.

First the hunger starts of, say, food, of primitive things. Then hunger for sex life, hunger for women, hunger for men, then for power, then for money. Then the hunger for spirituality starts.

When that hunger is concentrated and starts rising without any rationality about it : you don't know why you are seeking. Like Buddha he had everything, he had a wife and his father had provided him with everything. Still his heart was seeking. Why was he seeking ? It's the hunger that is not rationality, that isn’t explained.

And then this hunger starts and the way we quench that hunger is Dharma. The way we keep it intact is the Dharma. Supposing you are hungry: you go and eat some poison. Then it is a-dharma. I know you are hungry but you have to eat proper food. The knowledge about that is Dharma : what food you must eat, what book you must read, what people you must meet, how you should live, what should be your attitude towards others, others' things, other's wife, children, daughters. Everything related to the other, all that knowledge is Dharma. But it has no rationality. Like, you see, a man ran away- say- with somebody's daughter, he would say: « What's wrong ? » I cannot answer. I cannot answer. If a man has bad relations, say, with his own mother. He says : « What's wrong in this ? » You cannot answer, there's no rationality. It is wrong, it’s a fact : « Though shall not commit adultery. » Christ has said even to have adulteress eyes is wrong. But at the time, it was Christ who came. At the Moses time people did not know this eyes business, but Christ would see that and He had said that « Those who have even adulteress eyes are comiting the sin. »

So, how to deal with others ? Say, materialism now : you are so attached to matter is also problem with the Nabhi. Materialism is a false identification with matter: all false [inaudible word] with matter, with human beings, with books, with all that is created is the problem of Nabhi so you can understand how important it’s now. And the one that prescribes it is the Dharma, is the Guru. They did not come like Gurus to convince you and argue out with you, they said : « Thou shall not... » That's the commandment. Commandment means there's not to reason why. It's a commandment. There's no rationality in Dharma. Now, the one who is dharmic does not think about sin at all. Now, I'll tell you about myself, say, I go to a party and they start a cabaret dance. I do not think about it wether it is illegal or wether it is wrong with this adharma, nothing. I do not think but immediately I vomit. My grand-children, you see, we one day were watching the TV and three of them came vomitting. I went and saw the TV and it was a horrid thing going on. They just came and started vomitting. There's no rationality about it : it is again human sustenance. It is sub-human.
Like animals cannot feel the dirt or filth we can. We feel horrible smell coming, but those who work, say, in filth cannot feel any smell. If you go near a factory where sugar is produced you feel terrible there get the smell of this molasses and you can't bear it, but those who are working there, are so much used to it that they cannot feel it. Those who live in sin cannot feel the sin after some times, they become insensitive. But sin is a sin. So the insensitivity when we develop within ourselves we become adharmic. When we are sensitive about it we are dharmic.

On the left hand side, the intuition about it, the auspiciousness of it, is the thing that one has to learn: auspisciouness. Houswife is to be respected, honoured and comforted because it is auspiscious. A wife has to be respectable. A housewife doesn't- hum. It doesn't look nice for a housewife, you see, to be dressed in a funny way.

Once the chief cabinet secretary from India, his wife had come and she used to think she's very young and smart or something. She was wearing these tied jeans and things like that, you see, and the poor husband, you see, looked this side, that side. He didn't know what to do, and she's, I mean -very big nonsense- why ? And she came down in London, she was thinking how she's great, smart, thin. And they were invited to a dinner, you see, it's real thing, you know, real thing that has happened. And when this man was to go from somewhere and she had to go from somewhere else. So, when he went there, he said : « Where is my wife ? » They said : « She hasn't come yet. » He said : « No she was to come, she's not like that, she's much smarter than me, she must have arrived. » He looked around, he couldn't find her. And there was a lady standing, he said : « There your secretary has come, she's standing there. » And he didn't know what to say because she really looked like a secretary and not his wife.

So the housewife has to be dignified and respectable and she is to be respected. It's the part of that auspisciousness. And the wife, that essence of a wife is the governing so you can imagine those women who stand for lib and all that those who try to sort of say that : « Why should we be respectable if the husband is not, if he is carrying on with other women I should also carry on with other men. » You must know that you are being holding that great position in the stomach, on the left hand side of every human being. And that's why the left Nabhi catches in England so much and America, I think it's missing it already.

So, that is to ask to – say - to a man, you see, who is so developped, and so he thinks no ends of himself, you see, and the civilization where work is so important and money is even more important than work is, XX ? to think that a housewife's respectability is so important in the play of the universe? Yes it is. Where the women become dis-repectable the whole, you see, that's the breaking point of the society. There the human beings will start destroying. That's the real atomic bomb you've got. But it is so, I cannot rationalize it, it is made like that.

All the Gurus have said : « You should not drink. » Even Moses. Every one of them have said it : « You cannot drink. », means take any kind of a alcohol or any things that will take away your awareness because that is the place of your awareness. In the sense that whatever goes wrong here spoils your attention and if your attention is spoiled your awareness is spoiled. The attention is here. The attention is in the stomach, in the Void. So, how important is your attention.
Wherever you put your attention, that works out. When you are Realized, then your attention is Realized. Wherever you put your attention it works like a spade, it works like a sword, it works like a loving hand, it works like kiss, it works like a comforting heart. It is an enlightened attention in your stomach.
You see the mother has a child in the stomach, how it looks after the child, a little baby, how it protects. All that is there, is given to us through our Gurus, our own beings which are our masters, true teachers. The stomach teaches you, your stomach is your Guru. Amoeba became a human being through this stomach only, through the hunger it had. If it did not have hunger it would not have evolved. And the hunger teaches you, and when you learn it properly then you become the Guru yourself of the whole world and the universe.
Void, that' why, is very important and when you have had bad gurus, you've read horrible books, accepted them as facts and thruths, then your Void gets spoiled, your attention gets spoiled. It goes to wrong things. Attention, when it works through your eyes, can also go to wrong things. Everywhere wherever attention moves, it can do wrong things if it is adharmic. But as I said, there is no rationality about it. Dharma is to be accepted. You cannot rationalize it. To a point one can, but how far it harms you, you cannot rationalize. Then the curse of Divine comes on you.

Any kind of fanaticism or identification with one ideal- like Muslims thinking they are Muslims- they're adharmic. They're not dharmic. dharma is that you have to respect all the religions. It is a sin not to respect any incarnation. It is a sin not to respect any religion. And to identify with one, and denounce of other.
So, give up all these false dharmas and come to that one dharma which evolves you, which gives you light by which you can see the oneness among all these religions. As I've said before, that they are like beautiful flowers on one tree, nurtured by one sap, adorned by one tree, but fools take the flowers out, say that these are our flowers and kill them. And when these flowers die, uglyness becomes the so-called religions.

So, in essences, respect all the religions, all the incarnations. Fanaticism is absolutely against Nabhi and against the Void, because the whole balance of your Void has to be kept. In a very subtle and subtler form you'll be sticking onto it.

Say, you are born a Christian, so whatever you may try you can never get out of this feeling that we are Christians. You'll have much more respect for Mary in heart than for, say, Lakshmi. While, you are a Hindu, you will have much more respect for Radha than for Mary. That will be lingering on and lingering on.
When you develop that balance alright then you are dharmic.
That balancing has to be done.
So one realization is within you like this and one realization is this way , among you. and this is Dharma. Among all of you there has to be another integration, a complete integration of understanding. Whether you are white, black or red. Whether a Hindu, Christian or anything. You must know that there is only one way that is the living way of evolution and that there is only one God. And all of them [Incarnations] are aspects of the same God, and there is no quarelling among them.
Why are you quarelling ? This goes against the Void.
Complete integration works out in the stomach. And when you are completely integrated, you'll be surprised, rationality drops out. Automatically it drops out. Rationality kills this integration, because if your heart says something rationality says : « No, it's not right. ». But, if you take out your rationality there and just see for yourself, then wisdom comes in and you just do it whatever is wise and good for your spirituality.
Apart :
How are you now ?
Better

So, Void we use in Sahaja Yoga in many ways. First of all, we have to first of all see the Void of a person, how he has got the Void. You can see it, very easily because it might be pulsating. Maybe not be in your presence, I don't know, but in My presence it does. But immediately you can feel the Void. The Void you feel here, on the here or on here. Now, just see these are the bases of all the chakras. You feel the Void here, or here. Bases of all the chakras you can feel, so you can understand how important is the Void.

Now, if it is catching here anywhere or catching here, then you have to ask the person about these various points : whether he's a materialist, whether he is a fanatic. But these questions you cannot ask out directly like say : “Are you a fanatic ? You hit me hard. “
[Laughters]
Not to be very, very clever about it. Now how to ask a person whether you are a fanatic or not ? Very easy. Say, he's a Muslim. So, you just ask him to put your hand, saying that : « Should I put some Kumkum on your head ? » His fanaticism will come out immediately : « I can't do this ! » If he is a Christian, then you just ask him : « Can you put a Swastika on your head ? » Cross he'll accept. Swastika : « No, I'm not Hitler ! » That's how you can make it out whether he's open minded or not by suggesting things like this, you see. So then he comes out with his fanaticism. Then what do you do ? You do not condemn him as a fanatic, no. That won't be Sahaja style. You say : « Alright, alright, I've got it. The cross, would that be alright ? Alright, take the cross. So, if I say that cross was first Swastika then it became cross, will you be angry ? » Gradually it will work out.

33:03
But if he’s a fanatic, you go outside and tell Muhammad to be him nicely. He will do the job. Shoebeating is very necessary for all fanatics. Nice shoebeat. But fanatics are one of the most difficult persons.
33:25

Then those who have been to other gurus also will be showing up. These days you don't get fanatics so many to come to Sahaja Yoga. Mostly they are guru beaten. You see there are [frocks?] beaten people, there are guru beaten also. I mean, mostly they are guru beaten. [Laughters]
Then you ask them : « Have you been to a guru ? What your guru has done ? This, that. » If you tell them sometimes they can be fanatically attached to their gurus. Then they migh be angry. They'll do it, but what to do ? It is sometimes-
It ‘s the food ?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes It is....

It's good they are lookin after the food very nicely
[Laughters]
Otherwise if you have to cook also then all your attention is there. So it's much better that your ashram. [Laughters]

No headache, nothing, your are having a nice time here and their food is ready, now serve, come along, have your food. So, the right time we are talking about Void. [Laughters]

I'll sit here .
Sahaja Yogi: .. the Nabhi satisfied
Shri Mataji: Yes, make the food also dharmic and every thing.
Good. How are you now? Better?
Sahaja Yogini: Yes

Shri Mataji: How are you now?
[interruption of recording during the meal]

It's such a wide subject that I cannot cover it in one lecture, you coud write many books, but the most important thing about Void is that, that once you are enlightened you become dharmic yourself. The Dharma starts flowing through your hands. These vibrations have a capacity to establish Dharma. So, when you put your hands now towards the five elements. Say you put your hands towards the water or you put your hand in the water. The water gets enlighted, vibrated, but if somebody takes that water it will establish Dharma into that person. Supposing somebody is a drunkard, now you put this vibrated water to him, give him to drink. He feels nauseated after drinks. He'll throw away the drinks, then he will stop.

Some of you have noticed that when you came to Me first you felt terrible nausea within you and you felt like vomiting, sometimes you felt uneasy, you see. So these vibrations through the water now pass into your stomach and they establish dharma there, the proper relationship. It so happens that if you go on taking this water the right-side is that physically you feel alright and the water can give you such a power, that you can never get cancer of the stomach, cannot get any trouble with the stomach. But left-side side, which has greater power, this water, that it cleanses you, your sins - and puts your attention, fixes it up on dharma.

So, your attention doesn't do- you’re not tempted, that's how you've seen people who come to Sahaja Yoga can give up drinks easily. Because it turns your attention towards dharma, then if you want to take drinks, you just don't feel like after some times. You feel like vomiting, you feel like headache and all that. And it happens so easily. Now we know somebody here he gave up all his drinking in no time. Otherwise it's not possible to do that, but because of this happening in the stomach, now you cannot drink.

Just imagine. This is the great thing about Void is that once you are enlightened you can give something to the nature. You have been drawing everything from nature so far. First time now you start giving something to the nature. And what you give to the nature is so nourrishing to it also. Supposing you give vibrations to, say, fruits, or to trees, or to flowers. You will find they will be ten times more, the growth will be much more, they will be lustrous. And they will be very juicy, very tasty and the whole atmosphere will be different. Maybe after sometimes these trees if they will be standing there everybody passing that way if he touches that tree they will get the vibrations also.

So maybe a tree may become a curer, something like that. All those waters and all that, we talk of « curing water » are nothing but vibrated waters. They are vibrated. So, if the vibrated water goes inside, you get cured. So, this is on the left-hand side it works that it establishes your religion within you.

All the problems we have had is all completely cleansed out by them. In the same way if you enlighten a light now here. You have seen so many times how you can enlighten a light. So it starts going, see, both are there but this one is working a bit. That one also is going a little bit but this one makes a X? taking out the blackness. It is because it is enlightened. That is also enlightened, now we also ?. But this one actually in the hand is taking away the- If you see these lights you can feel they're like pulled out like this. As if, you see, the realized lights are pulled out like this, straight.
And, I've been to some of these churches where they have these lights and as soon as I enter these like they're all going like 'kakakakakak'. It is interesting to see how they start suddenly glowing like that. But people do not notice it because they do not understand why it has happened, but you can understand that. So, if you put the light, enlightened light - Say, yesterday, the other day, we had that Havana, is the enlightened light. Havana we had made it enlightened, Jagrut. Then whatever we put into it, you see, our badhas, it burns whatever we wanted to burn away. What is the beauty of fire is, that, say, if you have some mixed up gold and you put into fire, you find the gold will be separated and the filth or dirt or whatever is inside, it will be separated.

So, this quality which is the right hand side quality of the fire is becomes in the left hand side is that when you go near such a fire or you use such a fire or a light, then what happens that whatever is unwanted in you is burned away and you get the pure thing. So it purifies. Fire is a purifyer and it is a melter, it melts your heart. This fire melts your heart and you feel the compassion. So that's how every element can be enlightened and this is the work done in that Void by your Kundalini. Kundalini goes to various places and She enlightens all these elements in your stomach.
In the stomach the basic principle is of water. The Void is covered with water, and in the water there is salt and the salt is nothing but is the Dharma. Is the Dharma, the salt. That's why when we give you salt what happens the salt that is vibrated goes and helps you in the stomach. And salt shows it's own nature there by absorbing all that is in you which is, we can say, in the mobile there. A person - supposing is, hum, has got a cancer of throat, then he should take salt. If he has a right hand side problem he should take sugar. So these are the two qualities, you see, the five of dharmas are done by salt and five by sugar. And these are the best solvants in the world as you know. So, all these three things put together water, then salt, and the sugar, they solve the problem of the Void.

That's why we use these two things. If you remember Christ has said that you are the salt. That means you are the Gurus. Salt is the Guru. That's why he said : « You are the salt. » Because you are the Gurus. And salt disolves into water. Water is the Dharma. They are the absorber, always have a water of crytalization. The- it cannot without, the salt cannot exist without water. So, the water and salt put together means the ocean. So Void is the ocean within us. That's why it is called as Sagar. That means all the oceans of the world are in our stomach

43 :30
and if you want to hear them sometimes you can put your thumb in My ears and you can hear coming [as one sound...?] You can hear it.

So this is all the times socially churned and out of it comes out all that is good and whatever is bad is burnt away or washed away or made to – whith the air – it is made to be swept off. So the air element is also there, air element that we see all around.
[recording cut ]
So the vibrated air is a very important thing and it helps a lot.
[recording cut]
So I've talked to you about all the [?] of the fifth Akasha, the ether you can say. That works out when you are a realized soul. Then you, you also vibrate the Ether. That's how our, mean, collective work is done, through the Ether, you see. Now, supposing I want that you should get a proper seat [or ?] or something
Apart:
Alright, take a seat up there.
Anything materialistic you can say, [oh, my chair is going down there, how is it ?] I have to just worry about it, immediately it’ll go [order some set?] - [Shri Mataji snaps her fingers] - Alright ? So, Saint Michael and Saint Gabriel, both of them say now : « What should we do ? We must find out a proper place. » So, they take down into consideration. They bring him down here and find out a nice [place?] Is all done through Ether.

Ether, is the..., when it is enlightened, you see, then it communicates the ideas, the things that shall be done, or the desire, divine desires are carried out. And then you are placed in His hands sometimes you are surprised : « How am I here ? How are you here ? How do I meet you ? I mean, I was not to come this side and then now how did I come ? » All these things can be done through the Ether which -even we get our television and everything through Ether. But on the television, if the Ether, if you, say, enlighten then it will so happen, that a bad [?] program won't materialize. It won't materialize.
It can work very dynamically. You cannot imagine how these miracles take place. And real miracles are felt- of course we do feel the miracles of all the other elements but it's not so obvious as that of the Ether because you're suddenly surprised : « How this... ? Why ? » And it's everybody's surprised at it : « oh, here in the plane, you get all this. » So, this is done by Ether and it is so miraculous. It is so miraculous that it is hard to believe that it is possible.

Now, this Ehter works day time and night time. It doesn't take rest anywhere, you see. It's all the time working for us, means it's all the time ready to work out the divine work. All the time it is ready to work out the divine work. It doesn't wait. It doesn't wait for anyone to give orders or anything, it's just, just waiting there. As soon as it sees that this is desired, alright, nothing is to be told, just to desire and you'll say that : « Oh, what will be happening to such and such person ? » Finished, it's done. It is being transmitted.
The same Ether that transmits the - what you call ? - the air transmissions which you receive on the radios, radio transmissions. The same one, when enlightened, does all this job. He works it out everything. Everything that you want it works it out. And there's how the angels show their [ Shri Mataji searches the word in Marathi] miraculous feats. But it is worth noticing all that and watching it, and witnessing it and noting it down : « Oh, how it helped and how it worked out ! »
It also, ether when enlightened, brings people closer to divine power. It arranges how [?] But, now, one would ask what is the necessity for God to have such complicated methods of 'enlightening the matter'? Why not it has already the enlightened matter ? It's the question one should ask, I mean, I'm asking as you people are there, so I'm asking you. Let's see the answer.
