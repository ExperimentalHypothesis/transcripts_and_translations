Diwali Puja, 1st Day, Dhanteras 

[English Translation from Hindi]

It is wonderful that we have awakened our power that had already settled down there and we are lost in our own thoughts. But we have a lot of power within us and all this power has been bestowed to us by God. All of say God, God, and everybody knows that He is everywhere, resides everywhere, everywhere he witnesses. And He witnesses everything of ours with great love. Now you have come in His Kingdom. I have to tell you that I felt overjoyed to know that for the past so many years, Sahaj yoga has gained its speed remarkably. It means that people of Delhi, have got tremendous faith and are very social as well. Otherwise, I have been to so many places, there we had so much of publicity, even then, I can’t say, that everywhere people have transformed so much. You have to understand Sahaj yoga fully and you will have full authority over its blessings.

If you recognise Sahaj, sahaj will recognise you. It knows you and your status and what should be given to you. Now I am going to tell you, that I had come to Delhi long back and had thought that sahajyoga will establish very well in Delhi. The reason was that, the government was shifted here from Calcutta. What was sahaj was that all the government servants came here and the government has started functioning here. This arrangement was to make you collective and if you go to any other place, you could not make so many people collective. The amount of work that is done in Delhi, cannot be done anywhere else. This is My experience and I think that, there is something special about Delhi that the number of people is getting multiplied , everybody has transformed and everybody has understood fully what is Sahajyoga. You people don’t think why this miracle took place in Delhi. This is your quality. Delhi administration is running in a Sahaj way. The people of Delhi have helped us a lot. I just can’t tell you that it has happened in such a Sahaj way that it is difficult to understand. The people of Delhi have understood it thoroughly and inculcated it in their lives, in their being and it effected the people outwardly. Delhi has a great importance in the whole world. I can understand a lot, but I can’t understand how it is so in Delhi. Because in Delhi, there are government employees, the Govt. and the people have a particular thought process, but that is not the point. Here many people have come because of God’s blessings, they have come to Delhi specially for this purpose and so Sahajyoga has depth in Delhi. Just see a few Sahajyogis of Dehi, I am surprised, how they have achieved this depth.

In Delhi, Govt. administration plays such a big role, that everywhere, there were obstructions on account of it. But the people who joined Sahajyoga, have done a wonderful job. Ever where, the people are surprised that how it has spread so much in Delhi. They are Govt. employees. They give importance to the Govt. How is it that they have accepted Mother. It is very surprising, and everybody has observed it. But there is nothing to be surprised at, where there are God’s devotees, and where there is God is accepted in reality, there only Sahaj yoga establishes itself, there only Sahajyoga spreads, nothing can have its effect on it. You should understand God, understand His powers, and His capacity to work. And it is very much surprising, how this work of God will be done with the help of you people. Here we have sahajyogis , one better than the other. It is beyond my understanding, how it will transpire, when they are in Govt.jobs. And today is a great day that I am here and it is considered as a very auspicious day. I don’t know, how it is celebrated in Delhi, but it is a very auspicious day, because it is a very special day for starting any new assignment. The fact is that in our country people know a lot. The greatest thing is that, on the basis of astrology and other parameters, people know which day is auspicious, and the significance of the days.

This day is otherwise also very auspicious. And I am very happy that today I have come to meet you people. Today is a blissful day, specially blissful and the special blessing is that your problems will be solved. You will be helped by God. I can’t say so much about any other place, as I come to know in Delhi about the greatness of God and He knows that the people here are one better than the other. One more thing is there that He recognises as well all of you. May be, He doesn’t know many of you, It is quite possible, but the God that resides within me, knows all of you and they are very lean towards you. They have got a lot of faith and are confident, that you will raise the status of India. If Sahajyoga establishes here, and if it spreads from here, it will be wonderful. Now I have been to every country, to Russia etc. but the pure faith of the people of this place, and everybody’ s desire is different but you enjoy the blessings of faith.

But, I was so happy , when they said that there will be a puja today. I okeyed it. I said , it is ok. It is a good day. You know that today is the puja of Shri Laxmi. Here nobody performs Laxmi puja. So, it must be understood that today is a very important day. Laxmi gives you everything. She is Mother. She gives everything, all blessings, all comfort, and most important is that She enlightens your inner being. So somehow you recognise Laxmi. Laxmi doesn’t mean money, you have to understand that She is Goddess, and you have to respect money like Goddess. In our country, people do a lot for the sake of money, wrong things, that is very bad. But you have got a responsibility, to recognise Laxmi as Devi, and worship Her and understand that you cannot make fun of Laxmi. Laxmi blesses you and will go on blessing you. As such evil people are a few only, and you should be contented that Laxmi resides in your being and has accumulated all moments of joy and comfort for you. You are going to get all that and are have already got it. Now, you simply try to understand that my coming to this place today is a matter of chance. I didn’t have any such idea nor, it was in my knowledge. But I knew that I should come here regularly on this day, and it happened like that only. I have come here myself, I know there are lot of sahajyogis now, and I know, some of you could not come., but it doesn’t matter. I am talking about everyone, and I am sure that everyone will worship Laxmi and in the laxmi puja one should understand all forms of Laxmi, what is Her nature? We cannot understand Her, and if we cannot understand Her, we follow wrong path. So it should be understood that She is Devi and that She is your Mother, and that She can do anything for you, because She is very powerful and very affectionate, She doesn’t put you to any problem. If you get stuck up somewhere, She will save you. Such is the blessing/greatness of Laxmi. Here, specially Govt. workers, if they understand that This is the place where laxmi resides, the whole business will be ok. So, sometimes, we feel that Laxmi should bless this country. It is not so, we make mistakes not She. She is forgiving, and very kind to us, to all of us. But we ourself torture our own selves, contradict ourselves. And if it is decided that we will not do any wrong act, I am sure, that the prog .that was organised in Delhi, and it is the Land of Laxmi, so, here on this day, nobody will insult Laxmi, try to belittle Her. She has raised the status of our country tremendously, so we have to worship Laxmi. We have to recognise Laxmi, and She is our Mother. We should respect her out and out. Why I am telling you so, because you are sahajyogis, and you know that today Laxmi is worshipped and She is such a Mother who will not leave you astray come what may. You only recognise Laxmi as your Mother With a clean heart. All such people will definitely join Sahajyoga, because it will have its effect on everybody. May all of you will be blessed by Laxmi, and I know it will be so.

Sahajyoga has widely spread here. For that if we had to do another type of struggle,it would have been done. And here we have to do some other type of work too. You know, we have got lot of land, and the work is going on there. Everything is going on, on its own. I am not doing anything. It is happening by itself and I know, you don’t have to do anything and secondly, whatever are your desires, will be met here only and whatever you want to know, Laxmi ji’s blessings will be with you. So today is the day of Laxmi kripa.

May God bless all of you!
