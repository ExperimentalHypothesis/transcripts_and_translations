Only you can feel your spirit.

This energy has been placed in the triangular bone at the base of the spinal cord, has been there for ages, for many lives, has been following us.

She’s our mother and she’s born with us every life, every time. Waiting for an opportunity where somebody who’s authorized to awaken her, she takes birth with us again and again on this earth. She is the reflection of the desire of God, His desire that we should know Him, that we should become one with Him, that we should enter into the Kingdom of God so that we become the citizen of His kingdom and enjoy, enjoy the bountiful place of our Father. He is a father with compassion and love and He wants to give you this love, His love, His power of love to you. Like any good father would like to give His possessions to His own children. The one who is the essence of fatherhood waits for you in His kingdom to bespoke this great power of divine love through your spirit.

Spirit, it resides in the heart, spirit is the reflection of God almighty. But the hearts which are filled with hearted, which are filled with evil, which are filled with domination of others and torture of others, cannot reflect the divine. Only like a flicker I give the analogy of a gas light. As in the gas light there’s a little flicker, in the same way in the heart flickers the spirit. When this residual energy like the gas which is not enlightened rises up to this point, it catches that fire that enlightenment and your attention becomes enlightened.

From where is the sound coming?

Let them play.

Your attention gets enlightened, this attention which is so far [unclear] darkness.

The human attention is just like a pool of darkness there’s no light in it. It starts flowing into any direction it wants, with is all a lost case that’s what people think; they don’t know where to go, what to do; some people think that “All right, I’ll be very happy if I could have a lot of money and enjoy myself”. They’ve had, they’ve had everything not to fed up not [unclear] the children are learning out of their houses. They said let [unclear] look after the junks, we don’t want to.

There are affluent countries, the most affluent now like Switzerland and Sweden are completing among themselves has to find out how many ways there are to commit suicide. So this idea of getting happiness out of money becomes a secondary one.

There are other searches also human beings have but ultimately you come to the point where you do not know why you are unhappy. You have everything still you are very unhappy because whatever you are seeking in life is not money, is not power. Your human dignity is so much higher than all these things that you do not find any equation between them. You feel so disgusted with yourself. There why do you have to live it all these nonsense? This is not the stuff you are meant for. Your dignity doesn’t promise you to be happy under the circumstances which are normally accepted by people. The seeking becomes sadder and sadder, people start going deeper and deeper into their own being. I’m trying to find out a solution of this kind of a blind feeling from feeling that is all darkness, it’s all darkness. We have to find out. We do not know sometimes really what are we do expect, we do not know where are we going to get that peace which is promised.

Many scriptures and [unclear] where it is promised that you will get if you knock the door, the door will be opened and you want knocking on your head and nothing comes out of it. That in every endeavor human beings go to extremes if they found wonderful ball they die on the football field. If they are found of anything they become really crazy. There’s no balance in life. I wish the desire to know yourself, the desire to become that all forwarding power of God was asking as we have for other things, it will take us really to the essence of joy that is the spirit. Spirit is the light which gives us knowledge about of ourselves. When it light comes into our attention medical terminology we can say of what is over our attention is nothing per central nervous system. Whatever we know in our nervous central system is over attention. Supposing somebody’s standing behind us, we do not know because we cannot see it. Now I’ve not see someone but if somebody’s putting something hot on my feet I can, on my back I can feel it because I can feel it through my central nervous system. Whatever I can see, whatever I can hear, whatever I can smell, whatever I can actually feel is in my central nervous system. That is my attention but the spirit is not. Many people say “Oh we have a way of finding God, yes, we know the way”. Now, how do you know? Why deceive yourself for nothing at all? Nothing in normal life we never do like that. Nobody says “All right I’ve got 10 thousand pounds of human know I will to spend my money”. Of course you achieve them different but normally in a [unclear] simple man doesn’t know that way. So why say that there is a way of finding out God? If there was the person who can found it. The way is there. The method is there. But that cannot be handled by you. As I told you yesterday that we did not become human beings from chimpanzee by doing anything. Supposing we had cut our tapes for example or saved our body do you think would we becoming human beings? We have to become spontaneously; that is sahaja. Spontaneously, everything has happen to us spontaneously and even the attention has to receive the light of the spirit, it is going to be spontaneous. Whatever you have achieved on your central nervous system has been granted to you spontaneously. For example these eyes with which you see, what have you done to see anything? Just they are there, we take it for granted. In the same way if your evolution has to take place, it will take place spontaneously because the Creator was created you has to find you, your meaning; for example if I create an instrument and I do not use it, what’s the use of creating it? I have to put it to the mains to see that I use it if God has to use, he will have to put you to the use that it use to and that He is going to do, is a spontaneous happening. Or else He can do it to a person who has been authorized. So far your evolution took place. Perhaps you do not know maybe why somebody who was authorized and you are not aware of it. But now at human level you will know it, the evolution. And when you will get that, spirit flowing into your awareness radiating and acting then you’ll be amazed that feel yourself will be do the same. You will be able to do it. Like one light can enlighten another light and another light can enlighten another light. The light is already made here, only thing is some enlightened light has to come nearer. Is a very simple thing, is the simplest thing that you’re little talk about it, is like talking about all the history of [unclear] everything instead of telling you that put on the switch. This start it’s all done, it’s made it, it’s all within you, I do not have to create all these things neither you have to bother about. But sometimes the connections are lost, sometimes the chakras are spoiled. But all these exist within you, only thing is that the Kundalini is to be enlightened, to be awakened. And she knows everything, she is your mother, she knows everything about. She knows what have you been doing, how you have been unkind to her.

Sometimes I’ve seen people having Kundalini with such big holes and some of the Kundalini is, I’ve seen, bleeding like coloring bleeding color. Sometimes the Kundalini is a just like a wounded serpent on [unclear] their heads. Sometimes I saw beautiful just like a radiant beam they just shoot of.

Now we have sometimes quite of a Kundalini, it doesn’t matter. I’ve learned all the tricks of repairs so far and all the kinds of troubles that people have gone through. I have try to master it.

First I was an expert in Indian style of temperaments. There I met so many people who were [unclear] in India. There I went to America. Here also I discover not some different style of people. And then now I’m in your country by chance and I’ll be here for some time I believe. Of course I travel a lot and I found that English youth is perhaps the best in the whole world. I’m sorry to say but it is.

English youth are the best. I told somebody in some English, some Indian gentleman about it is it where to find the best disciples, I said in England. He was amazed. I said “They are little hard nuts to crack, no doubt, but once cracked they sort it out.” First the scholarship, second their assiduity and I think that thousands of the most important things that [unclear] is honesty of God because this is absolutely an honest affair, you cannot be dishonest about it. [unclear] was better than many Indians also we said but not the Indians villagers are perhaps the best because they are too simple. But many Indian youths who are westernized and now trying to become sophisticated. So they are thoroughly useless you see they are getting into a plastic affluence. Under these circumstances it’s more surprising how I find myself here in England and this great work which is actually prophesied long time back is taking roots in this country. But it’s a living work, it is easy to create thousands of plastic flowers, but to create a real one flower it takes time, it requires lot of concentration and labor. So the team maybe moving rather slowly but it is taking with shape. Lots of people all over the country are getting their realization. But you neutralize your understanding the divine.

One should know that I’m working here not as a salesman, ye, nothing is selling you, certain things must be understood that is not selling.

You are used to do shopping on the [unclear], we cannot understand a person who can do something without charging for it, but it is an insult even to think that you can pay for somebody’s labor. You’re so much used to this kind of a conditioning that we do not take thing seriously for which we do not pay and it’s a bad thing. You do not pay for the fresh air you have, you do not pay for the rain you get, you do not pay for the sunshine you have, you do not pay for the breathing you do, you do not pay for your own body, there how did you pay it for that? All that is important you cannot pay for.

The second thing one must know that you cannot read about it, while reading you cannot get it, it’s a thing that must actualized, that must happen, is like say Guru Nanaka has said that “Go and find within yourself”. But is to re-found within yourself, nor the seek people are sitting and singing this. For 2 and a half days they are all continuous process of singing the guru [unclear]. And they sing that letters find it within ourselves, it is reading in ourselves so what’s source of singing? Are they gone to find it? It would be like sing that if you have a headache, you want singing about the prescription you have got. When are you going to take the medicine is the point. So that second conditioning is that I have read in this book like that yesterday there was a gentleman of course he was from some organization just came to distract. Because you see there are some real organizations around in this country to make money in the name of God, in the name of realization, in the name of spirituality and also some things. So naturally they feel they’re challenged beside they’re talking about Shri Krishna. Of course he was a very half-riched fellow which do not know more about this still I talked to him. But now whatever Shri Krishna has wrong written, I say that this is completed in Sahaja Yoga no doubt. All of them what Christ was said or what [unclear] was said, everything is explained in Sahaja Yoga. Everything you’ll find completely manifested in Sahaja Yoga, you’ll be amazed even you’ll find out where is Christ within us, in what center He exist, where is [unclear], where is Nanaka, you will know their positions and you will know how to use them for this purpose. But to bring in the controversy people can say “All right, Christ said such a sahaj thing.” All right, it is said, no doubt and I can tell you about that but just to create a controversy why should you’re bringing people? All of them will be explained through Sahaja Yoga, you’ll be amazed. They are all with us not against us in anyway and absolutely cooperating and working it out. There’s no difference between them and us, we are on one side. You are all flowers of the same tree only the people who separate us are the people who take them away from the tree of life and fight. But the controversy why on starts is this way: but when Rama came people said “We don’t believe in you, we believe in Parashurama because Parashurama was dead by then. Very good idea! Now how face the reality when it comes to?  

Then came Shri Krishna 6000 years back. So when Shri Krishna started talking about reality this had you see you don’t tell us, we only believe in Rama. When Rama lived they put him out for 14 years in the forest. Very nicely! They never believed him, they only believe in Parashurama. Now when Shri Krishna came they said, you see, “We believed only in Shri Rama and not in you”. Shri Rama was overthing so Krishna did not tell anything about reality only told one disciple that’s Arjuna that was not realized.

Then came Christ. They said “No, we don’t believe in you and we believe in Moses. Our [unclear] this thing has to still come. You’re not Christ. Crucify!” Nicely we’re disappointed”.

Then came Mamath. They said “No, we don’t believe in you, we believe in Christ”. We believe in this, we believe in that. But the one who is really there, people don’t want to believe. You know the tragedy as a shame full thing. I think Christ life has proved beyond be on doubt that human beings are really stupid people. That’s why He must have rode the donkeys. Extremely stupid people! Such a create incarnation be crucified!

Then Mamath came. Mamath was given point, is tortured, then Nanaka came, tortured him! Anybody who is real must go through the tortures of people, everyone who is false and fake is extremely attractive.

What’s the matter with the human beings I cannot understand.

I went to one place recently, [unclear], and 2 ladies had come. They told me that “We went to one guru, he gaves us a mantra” but I said “Then you heard about him”. “Yes, now we have heard that he’s a drunker and he has got 5-6 tips”. Still we will not tell you his mantra, we still have faith in him. Is it really the [unclear] will you lose faith in him? I believe thousands of people went to see him when he was in [unclear]. I support was his credibility? Why did you find also very [unclear] , what was his name, what was he doing? He was in South Africa, living in a timeshare? From there he comes here and befools all the people and thousands of them are behind him. What is his credibility? Who was his father and who was his mother? And what good work he has done? And when he has taking away all their money still they want to believe him. Why? They are frightened. They don’t want to tell the mantra when he does not know who were the [unclear]. Two of his disciples came and told me the mantra was given, you’ll be amazed. The mantra was given was “thinga” like this. What you fall this one you see this show to someone, that’s call us thinga. It’s kind of Sanscrite word, it’s a hindi word. There’s some limit to [unclear].

If you are real diverse shippers of the truth and reality, you must face it. And you don’t know reality’s beauty. Your reality are beauty inside I see that lightening, I see that spirit. You do not see it, that’s why you are frightened. There’s nothing to be frightened of yourself, you’re the most beautiful thing within, the outside is frightening. That’s why you know people cannot sit alone. For them is a jail if they have to sit alone. But after realization you don’t know when you are alone, when you are with others. You enjoy yourself because it’s [unclear] enjoyable. You are the most enjoyable thing the God almighty has created. But you are made of mess out of yourself. Why? Because you listen to others. You are no more there, you depend on others to give comments on you and judge you. You do not have any judgement of your own. You have no self esteem about yourself. Once you’ve self realization you recognize and you find that you are that latest thing which is much more precious than thousands of these useless diamonds put together. And then you value yourself. Your whole system changes, your whole valuing system changes. You give up your ego, you give up your superego and you become yourself which is the spirit, which is the light, [unclear] shines the divine love of God.

When this Kundalini rises, she passes through various centers. You see there are 6 in number on top and one is down. The lower one is [unclear] the Kundalini and her protocol because She is your mother. That’s your innocence in the lowermost one. And about one are controlling the different parts of your body on physical level, on mental level, on emotional level. And when Kundalini rises, she enlightens the spiritual being in those centers. When these spiritual beings are enlightened, you get more energy. Many things happen when the Kundalini rises.

When she crosses this center, this is the center of Christ, you see there were the optic chiasma crosses each other, at that point is this center. It shifts a little because its energy after all it’s not look alike. And when this center is crossed, then you become [unclear] aware Nirvichar Samadhi. Means your enlightenment in the awareness comes in no doubt but there is no torture. You come between the 2 parts as past and future, you become silent, it is to be. Now one may say that “Mother, it is sad that people spent thousands of years getting this realization, getting even Nirvichar Samadhi no doubt. They’re maybe many [unclear] who say why should you give they accepted me this to these people, who are they? We have work so hard. But under tree of life in the beginning there were few flowers. The time has come today thousands of flowers are to [unclear] into fruit the time has come, the blossom time has come. And that’s why it is working out. You can see for yourself at the time of Christ how any disciples did he have. They were all fishermen. Even today in India if I’ve to talk to fishermen, I don’t think I can tell them about Sahaja Yoga. But we have many Sahaja Yogis who are fishermen in India, you’ll be amazed. They just got it, was they worth it, they don’t want to know it mentally. Oh, we’ve got it, we are just there. You don’t need any education for it. Even a small child if is a realized soul knows all everything about. Even in this country I’ve seen many children are born who are realized souls. Today only we heard about the birth of another one who is a realized soul.

How do you know a person is realized or not? When the Kundalini crosses this point which is called as the Fontanelle bone, in Sanskrit is called as Tallu where we call as the baptism takes place. Actual baptism not by some psychological college fellow coming and meaning of baptism, no, actual. You actually see this portion becoming soft and at that time when the Kundalini reaches there and crosses that you feel a cool breeze starts bluing through your hand [unclear] starts bluing. The cool pulsation radiation of the spirit starts flowing you can feel it. You can see this Kundalini pulsating with your naked eyes if there is an obstruction. If there is no obstruction it takes [unclear] of a second it just shoot you. If there is obstruction you can see the pulsation actually like a hard disc triangular bone was on, like this you can see it clearly. If a person had a liver you can see the Kundalini going and pulsating there and telling that “Oh yes, got liver I have to supply the liver”. You can see with her [unclear], you can see the rising of the Kundalini with a stethoscope you can feel the [unclear] of the sound and you can feel it here the sound coming up as [unclear] has said (Hindi or Marathi). That is at this summit zero made you start hear and hear is no sound otherwise that’s they call the zero sound.

You start hearing the heart anahath, is the sound without percution. Start hear and hear lap-tap, lap-tap and then it stops. And the moment it stops you find this cold breeze starts flowing.

This is the time you have test yourself, your spirit and this is the beginning of self-realization. This is the initiation I should say. Especially in Western countries because we are people who live with our rationality. Thou those who are intelligent must have recognized that rationality is a limited thing and if we are to go to an unlimited real Mother divine power, we have to go beyond it, it has to be triggered.

If you are reached that conclusion then you are really intelligent. But still we try to ramble about, try to verify. “Yes it is coming, yes, true but now let’s see Mataji has said that all the fingers get enlightened” as you see all the centers you start feeling. Is that realization again I say because it becomes a subjective knowledge in your body. It starts, you can start feeling all these centers and in that you start feeling your own centers realizing yourself within, you’re being within and also feeling the centers of others because now you are awareness. Your attention is enlightened by which you have become collectively conscious. You have become again I say not by giving lectures to you that your brothers and sisters now you’re become, you’re just become.

Those who are realized know where is your Kundalini, they know where is your problem, they know how to move the Kundalini, how to maneuver it, they know how what is their problem is, they know how to correct it and they know what are the blessings of the divine, is the complete enjoyment of your beings.          

This sure happen to everyone, will happen. But past had some patience with yourself. Many people that’s realization think that “We got it now and they disappear”. It doesn’t work out then. When you have to learn swimming, you have to learn it well otherwise you can go down. The same thing is about realization. Even if you have touched your realization still it is to be [unclear], it is to be looked after, you have to grow and mature. Like a human being you’re born and blended as a human being and it’s [unclear] in company of foxes can behave like foxes. In the same way thou you are newly born and your second birth has taken place fully still if you again were into the normal life and do not know how to guard yourself and protect yourself, can again become the same as you have been. And that’s all we have seen some people who lose the vibrations, some people definitely loose the vibrations. So after realization you have to see for yourself that you establish it and fully master it. You become a complete master. I give the analogy like this that we have 2 powers: left side and right side. The left side power is the power of desire, is the power by which our past is created. As we can say is the [unclear]. The right side power is the power of creation, is of action. So the left side power is the power of our emotions and the right side power is the power of our physical being and our mental being. These 2 powers are like accelerator and a break. For these powers we use alternately, simultaneously, slowly, balanced [unclear]. We try to learn the driving. And we try to learn the driving. When we have learned the driving, we will become an expert driver. But still you are not the master. Still the master is sitting behind. When you’re master you’re driving, you become the master, the guru. That’s what should happen to all of you. Of course by this happening of becoming one with the divine power your physical problems get solved, your mental problems get solved and your emotional problems get solved. A part from that even material problems get solved. The whole attitude towards life becomes that of a witness, you see the whole thing of the drama and the life becomes full of enjoyment. But I said yesterday it’s such a vast subject and the knowledge is so great. When you become knowledge yourself, when you become the light, when you become the love, then you, yourself will gradually know so many things like this room being dark, we don’t understand anything. But as soon as I put on the light, you see everything and find out all about.

I must have had at least 200 speeches in England so far, maybe more. I don’t know how many. But there are so many tapes these people have got in English. But still every time I speak they say “Mother, every time you say something new. It’s rather surprising.”

So I would say that you cannot know it through lectures, through talking, argument, you better know it within yourself.

Now yesterday, we asked 2 gentlemen got up and ask me questions. And they did where not knowing what they want to do, oh as I told you that they paid by some organization. And when they found that they could not any further they went away. So it’s such a waste, you see. We have to be fair to others. If you are not interested in your realization, is better to go away. There are many people with different caliber; they just come because they were walking on the road, they saw my photograph, they came and finished.

If you are really seeking then you better have it, you better get it, because if you do not get it in this life, you’ll coming again next life for this. This is the ultimate that you must find, you work it out and I am sure it will work it out. Pay a little attention to yourself not to others! Where is works out also, we have a center [unclear] in Britain and you have just now heard from Pamela, she’s the one who’s organizing here, we have other people also. We have quite a lot of people who are good Sahaja Yogis and all know a lot about it. Also we have some books for you to guide, there was one book written by a Swiss, Swiss caller who is a French speaking boy but the book was then edited in English, was inaugurated by your high commissioner and also is available not today but will be available if you order about it called as “The Advent”.
