Shri Mataji: Now those who are standing on this line, should, first of all, see that your number is all right. Please put your number all right. And stand facing this side, not facing me but this side ...Do it fast ...
Arriving ...
Now try to remember that there will be a piece of cloth and you have to walk very very slowly ...There are 7 stanzas that will be sung. And in the last stanza, that will be sung then you have to garland your fiance's ...
When the cloth goes down then you have to garland and you have to put down your head, you have to put down your head when you are walking thinking that you are taking these few steps for your auspicious marriage. So you have to meditate on that point. And move very very slowly! Now you have to walk a very little distance if you see that ...Now they will be giving you garlands. Face this side. Now see that you stand in the line first of all...And you have to move in the line also...Hold it in both the hands put your head down as much as you can ...There is going to be the exchange of Garlands. You don't have to wear a Garlands, please! And the shining one should be behind and the flower one should be in front...So when you put it shining one comes up... Will you please do that, and stand by the number. These garlands are to be exchanged. Please keep the line straight ...It's rather ...Just move properly ...Keep the line.
Now put the shining one outside and the flower one inside ...And hold it in both the hands...Put shining one towards yourself. Please see that your numbers are correct. Don't be nervous. Keep the shining one towards yourself. He should follow. The best one must follow. The best one must follow the bridegroom. The flower girl should be in front. Those who haven't got a shining garland must hold on to them, We are sending them over ...
Alright, go to that side.
Now Please listen. Your flower garland should be outside and the shining one inside. Now brides will be walking towards you. But the bridegrooms have to stand on their own places. Now the bride should not spoil the line...They have little ... They have moved ...Be careful that you have to walk in the line. That's the only thing you have to see ...Will you please move a little bit ...
No, No little back ...What's so hurry ? Take it easy! It's only you have to walk a little few steps...Now ...so only the 7 stanzas will be sung and that is the time you will be throwing the last bit of these 'akshatha' meaning the rice which is red in colour. At that time then this cloth will go down. First, the bride's have to garland the boys and then the boys the bridegroom has to garland the girls. Before garlanding, you should see it's your fiance. So put down your heads and once we start singing very slowly you should move And these flower girls will be moving in front of you.
