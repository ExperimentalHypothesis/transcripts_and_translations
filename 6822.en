Shri Durga Puja. Rahuri (India), 1 February 1982.

Today is a special day. There is a combination of two things happening. 

[Shri Mataji informs in Marathi that first She will speak in English and then in Marathi]

Today is first in the morning time, at 8:15 in the morning, was a very important day that started at 8:15 in the morning, called as Rath Saptami. It's the seventh day and it is said that sun travels with his seven forces, seven colors in a big chariot and today they celebrate this day as a day when sun travels with a divine vibrations all over the world and illumines. It was too early for anyone of you to be [inaudible] so [inaudible].


I got up very early of course and worked out that part for you. The second important thing which is a combination, which is a very, very auspicious thing that you get on one day, two dates. One is Rath Saptami, on that day you cannot do havan because it is the Surya already is there. So the second thing is today we do is a very great puja of Ashtami. Is the day when the Goddess killed nine rakshasas together with Her eight hands. So today is a very special day for which a very special attention is needed.
	

It's only at the behest of the bhaktas that the Goddess took Her form and killed all these rakshashas. Also with Her eight hands, She killed Mahishasur. That's why She's called as Mahishasur Mardini. She's called as Nav-Chandi, one who has killed nine chandas, means nine rakshashas She has killed. So is a very important day and very vital and very deep. 


It's very simple to say Mother, we have fixed Your puja on such and such date. Nobody thinks what Mother has to work behind these things. You can't fix My puja, it's not proper. It is I who can tell you what time is the best for you to do the puja. So it starts at two minutes past twelve. So now we can start it and that's why though I delayed my bath but that would be too late, I started my bath little early. (aside remarks) Then only we can do. 


So today is the day of the Goddess, a very important day that you are here. Somehow we are having all the pujas on [unclear : sounds like - Monday or My date] , that's why I am wearing this special type of a sari, which is to be used for Ashta Puja's Vahana, is a tiger as well as a lion. Imagine where I'm staying, there is a photograph of a tiger and a lion, both in that photo. You can go and see for yourself. Normally you never get these but that is there, beautiful photograph enlarged, a tiger and a lion.  


So in the morning the Surya was very beautiful, I don't know if you saw the morning sun. At least tomorrow try to see. It's not important how long you sleep here, what food you eat, whether you get it in time and all that. You should get rid of these habits, it's very important. And these regularities and all these mundane type of things, the bounding of timing and all that, you must get out of this space, time, everything. And should not go on worrying about things because you get so exhausted, without doing any work you feel exhausted. Because you are so fixed up, so fixed up that you can't get out of these habits, you see. While the Indians are not fixed up like this. They know that Mother knows the best. She will come at the time when the puja has to start. So, one should try to understand that if I am the God then why should you worry?


But I have one problem with the Western mind is that if they cannot conceive it, they start criticizing. Instead of making yourself subtler and subtler to conceive the beauty of the Divine, if you don't get it you will start criticizing on any point. Anything you can get hold of and you'll start criticizing. So that's not the way we can grow. That's why I'm telling you beforehand that this puja is very important and at this puja, you have to request that nine chandas who are still there be killed and this Mahishasur also should be killed. They should be driven out and that's how it is going to work out. 


It's very important, very important [inaudible] see it is not easy just to organize a programme like a preside over something you just come along, it is not that. It is much, much deeper. It is much deeper significance, much deeper work has to be done so many things have to be worked out, it's a very subtle thing. And the more you discuss it, the more you talk about it, you lose. You should keep quiet and absorb.


So today is not a day of such a mundane [unclear : could be - type OR time]. It is very important in this small place where we are sitting. We are doing a tremendous job and you people who have suffered the most on account of these rakshashas, should be absolutely intensive, be careful that these sinners must go out. Something has to be done. Instead of thinking about yourself and your inconveniences, your troubles and  whatever you call them which are not so important at all.


You are saints and you must support all divine work with complete understanding. On the contrary if you are so much worried about your own things, I mean you are a fool, you yourself are fool, so I would say that even some people will say that this happened, that happened perhaps the group is bit too big [...... inaudible]. I always had a feeling that this group is increasing bit too much. We didn't have any idea of so many people coming in. But then they are sharing, they are settled down, there is some place to sleep. And if you can understand see that these things are not important then you go to England and just sleep or you go to Australia and just sleep (laughter) I mean you have all the time. Just now you are here to become subtler and subtler.


Now the time has started and the Brahmin also came at the right time. So we have to be one with the subtleties. Sahaja Yoga is not possible if you want to see it from a gross level. You cannot understand. I have already told you that without realization, you cannot have Sahaja Yoga. But even after realization, if you stick on to those old things which belongs to the egg [Unclear] you will have no advantage. So try to become subtler and subtler. And don't think about it. You will relax, you will feel better, you [unclear], that you should have food in the right time, this at the right time, this should be the food, I mean its such a stuck up thing. We cannot be stuck up with food; we cannot be stuck up with all these things.


You are going to a level where nobody has reached. With this understanding if you surrender means not to give Me anything but to get rid of your ego and your stuck up ideas which there have been, it would be a very good thing. When you discuss also among yourselves, nobody should discuss inconveniences. I had told you that in a village it's a very difficult thing [inaudible]. You don't have to go to Himalayas but traveling through India is not easy. 


And I had told all of you  I have lived, I live with much more conveniences and comforts that anyone of you live. But I can adjust myself much more. So you should also try to forget about it. Don't talk of your inconveniences. That'll make you very gross. The one who becomes subtler and subtler can only achieve something.


[Mother speaks in Marathi]

Today is Ashatmi. Wah and morning is Rath Saptami. Getting a puja on Ashtami is a very big thing and at Rahuri my maternal home is also there. On this day of Ashatmi we celebrate this day, Rama Devi as Ashta Bhuja Devi who made great conquests, prominent conquests being the killing of the big, big bad rakshasas, destroying them killing them. She is called as Nav Chandi, also as Chandika, Ashta Bhuja, Durga etc. many other names are there and She has destroyed all these chanda, munda and others, all the nav chandas, that is why She is called Nav Chandi. She has also destroyed mahishasura and after killing mahishasura, the Gods showered praises on Her, but those bhaktas who called Her, they were all very dharmic, sattvik, with very good qualities. Having been very much pleased with their qualities, the Devi took incarnation. So those qualities should be in us. What are our feelings towards the Devi. Mataji, we have fixed Your puja, just like we have arranged one programme, so You please come. In many villages, Mataji, we have kept the puja at this time, keeping will not do, and you cannot keep like this. If I am pleased, I will sit for the puja, otherwise not, it depends on Me. You have to invite the Devi first, pacharan is there, etc etc. Otherwise the Devi will not sit ............... Devi is not in need of the puja, you are in need of the puja. She has to be pleased, when the Devi is prassan chitta [unclear]  Her children have made lot of mistakes .........Her children are still making  mistakes. They have shraddha (Faith), some have shraddha but make mistakes, in some there is no shraddha at all but are superficial, they will outwardly show they are very good, seeing all these things the Devi's mind becomes saddened and feels why the puja should be given to such people who do not deserve this. So you should become sadguni. In sadgunas, the highest quality is, Shankaracharya, Adi Shankaracharya was asked, which is the greatest quality, He said Devi bhakti, Mother's bhakti. She is Devi your Mother is the Devi understanding that do Her bhakti, in that bhakti there should not be any false thing. The first quality, the highest quality if it js seen in a human being from his heart, all his bad qualities will be destroyed, he will get light and attain moksha. That is why He has always praised the Devi. In the beginning He has described a lot, written lots of books like Vivek Chudamani etc. Lastly He said that by only pleasing the Devi one can get everything, then why do these things, why to do debates, why to do discourses and break one's head. Just praise the Devi and you will get whatever one wants. His intelligence (Wisdom) very few people have. When that intelligence comes into us, then you will get the authority. The same way without doing anything also I am prasanna chitta  now and any number of mistakes you make I will forgive them all, without doing that it will not be possible because I have come with a very big heart and will forgive all your mistakes, but cheating (lying) on Me you should not do and all the time crying  and repeatedly saying that I have committed mistakes will also not do, then it becomes problem for the Devi. You should ask for forgiveness from the Devi and take a vow today that hereafter we will not repeat the mistakes. Today's ashatmi is called as Bhishma Ashatmi, Bhishma Ashatmi, now Bhishma had taken vow which you all know, that vow was never broken by him under any circumstances, therefore today you have to take a vow, this ashatmi you all take vow that , because of this vow all the world will be benefited from it fruits, you should not think how will it happen, from this small place, this is a very big centre, so whatever vow you take now with complete devotion and utmost faith, the fruits of which will be for the whole world, that is how you should think.

Talk in English (15:50)

Today is another day, is a called Bhishma Ashtami, is the day when Bhishma, a great saint who took a great vow and that vow he carried out all his life. It was a great vow he took. So today also is the day of the vow. He took on an Ashtami day. On Ashtami day he took a vow, so today is another day for you to take a vow. So also we should try to take a vow. And with that vow, you should be able to achieve something which has not been yet achieved.


This achievement is not only for these people, it's not only for Maharashtra, it is not only for India, it is not only for the whole world, but for the whole Universe. So you are playing a very important, vital role and one should try to improve one's quality of life, quality of [inaudible] unless and until you have that substantial quality, nothing is going to work out.


This is what I am telling them that you must work out in such a way that you become  substantially dedicated to Sahaja Yoga. Not just for your sake, not just for your family or for your country but for the whole Universe. So you are the seeds who are going to create that great atmosphere that will bring forth the great change that we are expecting of Mahayoga. 


It is very important to understand that so many people have talked about this and I have come across a book which was written 2000 years back which describes about this  Mahayoga [inaudible]. It's very interesting, after the puja and havan, I think Mr. Chauhan will translate it to you and you can understand what is about. So let us start now.

In India, the custom is the wife has to sit next to the husband always for anything, for food, or for anything but in England is just the other way around.
