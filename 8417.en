The environment plays a big role in the reaction of a person. The sensitivity of the charkas becomes dull after the first few shocks to them. Then a human being starts living with all the shocking habits very easily. He exists, but in a very superficial manner and does not want to go down into his depth as he cannot face the shocks that are stored within. He tries to forget them as that helps him to exist. But mere existence is not accepted by people like you and many others who face themselves. They are brave and courageous children of mine. Sahja yoga can help only those.

You have been worried about others. To the extent that you want their emancipation I am willing to agree. But this is only possible if you can see the purpose of emancipation. The purpose is to introduce to their awareness the kingdom of God, His laws and His glory. The responsibility of every individual as an instrument is to accept Him in his full freedom. The object of sahaja yoga is complete liberation hence nothing can be done arbitrarily by Adi Shakti. The only thing I can do is to lead you and guide you to awaken your divinity in full freedom.
