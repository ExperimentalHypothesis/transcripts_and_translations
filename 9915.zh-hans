崇拜和火祭的重要性

1983年6月18日法国巴黎

锡吕‧玛塔吉:你好!我们正在等你来这儿。哦,我想我要穿上毛衣了。你好!我们正在等你来,等Christopher来这儿。他怎么了?很好。他的头怎么了?

瑜伽士:换牛奶,母亲。

锡吕‧玛塔吉:哦,Christopher,你回来了?哦哦哦......你要盖住他的头,天还挺冷的。好了好了好了,怎么了?他在冥想。【婴儿发出哼哼声】不不不不【锡吕‧玛塔吉轻轻摇晃着婴儿】你必须一直把他贴近身边。最好帮他盖多点儿。好了,你去里面多拿点什么。我想你也要穿上毛衣什么的,外面还挺冷。

瑜伽士:谢谢您,母亲。

锡吕‧玛塔吉:在他头部多盖点儿。

瑜伽士:这是来自奥地利霎哈嘉瑜伽士的礼物,奥地利霎哈嘉瑜伽士送给法国霎哈嘉瑜伽士的礼物。

锡吕‧玛塔吉:啊哈,漂亮。

格雷瓜读着海报上面的文字:“我看见天堂开启,凝望着天堂中呈现的一匹白马。”

锡吕‧玛塔吉:译成法语。

终于把我的毛衣带来了。Jenny可以拿来。

格雷瓜:把毛衣给母亲。

米歇尔·C:母亲,我有一两件礼物献给您。

锡吕‧玛塔吉:再说一遍?

米歇尔·C:第一件是我们从鲁昂给您带的软垫,您可以用来垫脚。还有这个城市徽章。

锡吕‧玛塔吉:哦,我看看,这是什么?

米歇尔·C:鲁昂市的徽章

锡吕‧玛塔吉:那是什么?

米歇尔·C:鲁昂市的徽章

锡吕‧玛塔吉:这些标记是什么?

米歇尔·C:三朵百合花。

锡吕‧玛塔吉:百合花?

米歇尔·C:百合花。我觉得它就像古代法国的一朵莲花。

锡吕‧玛塔吉:漂亮。非常感谢你。

米歇尔·C:不用谢,母亲。

锡吕‧玛塔吉:嗯,你可以保管一下吗?谢谢你。

天还挺冷的,风要吹散云层了。我一到这里,天气就玩把戏,你们看,它总是捉弄你。【笑声】是的,最好给他盖好。你也穿暖和一点儿,我希望你们都穿得足够暖和。

我很高兴能和这么多霎哈嘉瑜伽士在一起。他们中许多是新来的,对我来说不是新来的,也许几千年以前我已认识你们所有人了。【锡吕‧玛塔吉笑着】你们坐在阳光下。

在霎哈嘉瑜伽,你们都要知道一件很简单的事情:你们都是永恒的灵,凡不属灵的都不是你们自己。

我们可以把灵比作太阳。太阳会被云层覆盖,太阳上会有些叠影,但此时此刻,太阳依然是太阳。你们不能照亮太阳,只有太阳能照亮它自己。当云层散去,叠影移开,太阳便光芒四射、穿透大气层。我们的灵体也一样,被无知所遮蔽。只要遮蔽仍在,你们便看不见灵体。即使少量云层消失,那叠影还是存在。一定要晴空万里,才能看见穿透而来的灵性之光。我们有许多方法可以设法去除那些云层。

首先也是最重要的是这样一种假定,一种信念:你们是个灵,其余的都是叠影。你们必须在自己的内在做出这样的假设,在得到自觉以后,这应该变得很容易:你们已远远超越你们现在的所知,你们已大不相同。

所以,现在新的情况出现了,你们这种信心不是盲目的,而是由经验所得。因此不要用你们的聪明去对抗这信心,不要试图挑战它。如果你们的聪明挑战信心,而你们又听信了你们的聪明头脑,那么你们便会再次下跌。

即使只是瞥见空中一颗星星,科学家们也会相信那颗星的存在。因此,同样地,即使你们只在一瞬间感觉到你们的自觉,你们至少要相信,你们也是个灵。你们要紧紧抓着那个经验,并将注意力保持在你们是个灵这一事实上,告诉你们的聪明不要再欺骗你。由此,你们可以不用再理会你们的聪明。

此时,你们的聪明便会开始为灵性追求而工作,这就是信心的意思。信心能生出纯粹的智慧。现在,你们看见大部分云层都已散去,但还有一些云翳。所以你们要用圣灵之风来驱散浮云。你们知道,利用风的方法有很多。

我希望意大利人能理解。

这风源于别处,源于圣灵,源于你们自己的灵量。而且,你们还有太初灵量的力量在你们面前,与之前的许多求道者相比,我必须说,你们已经十分幸运。

因为崇拜一些雕像(Vigraha),哪怕大地之母为这雕像注入了生命能量,人们都会有很大问题。首先,他们必须做一种所谓Sarvikalpa Samadhi的冥想,即你们必须凝神在雕像上,即“vigraha”,“vigraha”的意思是含有生命能量的雕像。然后持续凝视此雕像,并尝试提升灵量。

灵量过去常常上升至额轮,但跃升至顶轮之上则是不可能的事儿,因为一个人必须从“有形相”走到“无形相”,而摆脱“有形相”走到“无形相”这一步是非常困难的。即使是专注于抽象或“无形相”上,也是另一件做不到的事儿,就像穆斯林所做的,或其他许多人尝试做的那样。

在这种情况下,化“无形相”为“有形相”就成为必要,如此一来,对你们来说就不再复杂了。一旦你们专注于有形,便能成为无形。就好像你们面前有一块冰,一旦你们用手去触摸它,冰便融化,你们便会感觉到冰的清凉。因此现在这个问题被轻易地解决了。

崇拜便是一件你们可以将有形激发为无形的事情。现在,你们的(轮穴)中心是能量中心,所有这些轮穴里也有主导神祇安坐在那里,祂们也是化为有形的无形。当你们做崇拜时,有形便化作无形的能量,然后此无形的能量开始流动,之后便凉风吹拂。就这样,这些错误认同、灵体之上的叠影就被去除了。

你们不能思考崇拜,整件事情都是发生在超越思维的领域。因此,你们必须认识到,你们不能对崇拜作理性解释。你们应该让轮穴得到最大的好处。为此,你们必须完全地只专注于崇拜,以及凉风如何涌动。这凉风会来处理,会驱散所有浮云。

所以你唯一要做的或唯一的方法就是专注于崇拜,静观。你是一个见证者 (Seer)。见证者有两个意思,你只是看,只是看着,仅仅只是知晓,这就是见证者。没有任何思维,没有任何反应,只是自发自然地看见和吸收,这就是见证者。这是做崇拜的最佳方式。

对我来说,有时这是个负担,因为你们与神祇之间应该有一定的对等性,必须要存在某种平衡。你们念诵所有口诀,神祇都被唤醒了,但你们就在那里却又不想吸收任何东西进入内心。于是,我就不得不储存所有那些我体内产生的、额外的能量。所以,如果你们敞开心扉并无思虑地观看崇拜那就会好很多。。

今天我们会把崇拜方法的次序对调,先做火祭(Havana),后做崇拜,这样会更好些。因为通过火祭我们将唤起火元素,它会烧掉所有的邪恶。当你们为我洗莲足时,你们在做同样的事;当你们点火,也一样。今天我们会先做火祭,后做崇拜,二者是一样的。你们可以用火或水来崇拜我。

火的本质是发光(tejas)。你们做火祭时,所有错误,所有邪恶都会被烧为灰烬,之后,光芒会显现在求道者的脸上、身上,当你们做火祭的同时,空气中也会充满美好的生命能量。所以,我认为最好是先做火祭,然后再做崇拜。

愿神祝福你们所有人!

Alexandre: Mother, we have learned the Ganesha "Atvatham Shirsham".
Shri Mataji: Atharva, Atharvashirsha. Ganesha Atharvashirsha.
Alexandre: Then we’ll say in French, or in English, I don’t know, up to You.
Shri Mataji: All right, say it in French.
Or better to translate it because there are other people.
Alexandre: OK.
Shri Mataji: First English and then French.
Alexandre: And first, in Sanskrit we don’t say, Mother?
Shri Mataji: It’s all right, I can understand English all right.
[Laughter]
It’s all mantras for Me to understand.
Alexandre: Shri Ganesha. Om tawme wa sakchat, Shri Ganesha sakchat, Shri Adi Shalti Mataji, Shri Nirmala Devi namoh namaha
The holy mantra of Shri Mataji. [The three great mantras]
[Ganesha Atharvashirsha in English and in French]

Shri Mataji: Beautiful. Voice is very beautiful. It’s good. All right, now.
Right now we’ll be having the fire. It’s all right.

Shri Mataji: Now, how do you make it [inaudible]
Alexandre: There’s already some, it’s behind.
Camila, there’s some work for you to do.
Come along. You can look after the fire.
Let others see the fire.
Alexandre: Mother, [first should] we recite Your names or names of Shri Vishnu?
Vishnu, Vishnu’s names?
Shri Mataji: Yes, Vishnu’s names.
Alexandre: 108 names of Vishnu?
Shri Mataji: It would be better Vishnu’s names.
Have you got 1000 names?
Alexandre: Not, 108 names.
Shri Mataji: Devi’s?
Alexandre: Devi’s we can go.
Marie: The Devi’s names Mother we have a translation in French
Alexandre: 108. Mother is asking for 1000. We have Lalita Sahasranama.
Shri Mataji: But who knows Sanskrit? It’s in Hindi?
Alexandre: It’s written in French.
Shri Mataji: All right, then it’s all right.

Sahaja Yogi: The vibrated Kumkum.
Shri Mataji: Now you put some water in it and put it to all the people, now.
Today I would say that from France those who came to see Me, from all these places, one from each centre should come forward.

One from Britany.
These are too big, I think. You can put the bigger ones to make a triangle first, downward. The bigger ones.

Maria? The triangle on the three sides.
Marie: Where do they come Mother, for the havan?
Shri Mataji: One on top of another, this be better. Yes, it’s closer, yes, that’s why.

Sahaja Yogini: Would You like some tea or?
Shri Mataji: Yes, it would be nice
Sahaja Yogini: More than water, you don’t want water, yes Mother.

Shri Mataji: No, no, no, something like a [inaudible] paper like thing, lighter.
Is that the light thing? And have you got camphor with you? Something lighter to be, underneath.
You don’t have anything. Make it smaller, smaller here, yes.
Put it on top of this thing, not underneath. Not underneath, put it on top.
Covering this. Yes, put these on top.
Yes, like that, yes, that’s the right thing.

You have to keep a hole in between. Arrange it in such a way there is a hole in between, in the centre.

All right, now arrange on top of this. Now, this is all right. Please cover with this [inaudible]. I think there should be a platform first. There should be a platform first and then, in the centre there should be a platform.
Yes, make a platform there, yes, down here, yes, that’s it. And on the platform- just wait, Marcus, on the platform you put another thing. That’s better, yeah. Do you have some more with you? All right. Like that, yes.
To begin with that’s sufficient.
That’s all.

Alexandre: Mother we have Vishnu Sahasranama Stotram and Shri Lalita.
Shri Mataji: But it should be in Sanskrit.
Alexandre: No, there is, also here it’s written in...
Shri Mataji: You can read that.
Alexandre: Yes.
Shri Mataji: So.
Alexandre: This is Vishnu’s names.
Shri Mataji: You’d like to do 108, yes? What we’ll do, we can do 108 of the Goddess and 108 of Shri Vishnu, that’s the best.
Alexandre: All right, Mother. All right.

Shri Mataji: And one from Paris also should be there, a new person.
Alexandre: A new person yes.

Shri Mataji: From Paris, someone. 58:36
Shri Mataji: Children, please, you’d better now [inaudible].
Marie: Mother?
Shri Mataji: Yes.
Marie: We have the 108 names translated in French in the form of a poem.
Shri Mataji: Oh. Where?
Marie: Here.
Shri Mataji: [Inaudible]
Now, can you put something for Me there?
Alexandre: You want to sit here, on the chair?
Shri Mataji: You tell them also; I’ll guide them better.
Some chair.
Vanessa you come here, you come and sit here, this side.
You come this side. All the children can sit next to Me.
I’m worried about it.
[Cut in the video] 59:53
Alexandre: Shall we say the mantra for the fire, Mother?
We have to say together Shri Agni Devata, who is the Devi-
Shri Mataji: Be careful about it. Don’t be too near. Little further, it’s moving all the time.
Now say the mantra.
Alexandre: Shri Agni Devata who is a Devi, the aspect of fire in Shri Mataji.
[Collective mantra]
Shri Swaha Swamini who is a principle of-
Shri Mataji: No, no. What’s the?
Alexandre: Swaha Swamini.
Shri Mataji: OK. Swa-ha.
Swaha is the quality of the, of the fire which consumes everything. Swa-ha.
[Collective mantra]

Shri Mataji: Now, after every name that he takes, you have to take the thing from your hand like this, and take it round to the right side and put it in the fire. But those who haven’t got these things in the hand should take up just their hand like that, thinking that they have it in their hand, and moving it upward like that and put it in the fire. And you all should say “Swaha”. Now, just a minute. After every name, after every name.
Alexandre: The 108 names of Shri Vishnu. First, Mother, it’s all right?
Shri Mataji: First the Devi.
Alexandre: First the Devi, sorry.
OM twame wa sakchat Shri Mata namaha
OM, Swaha
OM twame wa sakchat Shri Maharajni namaha
OM, Swaha...

Shri Mataji: Now we’ll do the Vishnu Sahasranama, hundred and eight. Again, you distribute the rice, distribute it.
Alexandre: Is it enough, Mother?
Shri Mataji: Beg your pardon?
Alexandre: Is it enough, it should be made quickly, the names?
Shri Mataji: What’s the time now?
Alexandre: The time?
Marie: It’s 2 o’clock, Mother.
Alexandre: 2 pm. We have only to be at 6.30 in Paris later on. But You don’t need to be there as early. We can arrive before You and we can give a practical session to the people. Explain them to [inaudible].
Shri Mataji: Then you should come at 6 pm.
Alexandre: Yes, that’s true.

Shri Mataji: You see, these people want to be there only for their body.
Alexandre: Yes, that’s true.
Shri Mataji: One fellow, he has got back pain.
Alexandre: Yes, something like that.
Shri Mataji: He’s the only one who had. You bring the oil and all that and you can massage him.
Alexandre: Yes, all right, Mother. We’ll give him a treatment. No problem. I think we can manage.
Shri Mataji: You would like to do 108 [inaudible]
Alexandre: Some people can go there and give them a practical session Mother, on how to meditate in Sahaja Yoga, how to work on themselves.
Shri Mataji: So, I think, 21 names of Vishnu are sufficient.
Alexandre: All right, Mother. OK.
[Collective mantras]

Shri Mataji: OK. What you call the finishing part of it [inaudible]. For that you have to use some sort of a fruit. Last thing. Would you have something? What is the special fruit of France?
Alexandre: The special fruit of France? Apples!
Shri Mataji: Apples, or you should have...
Alexandre: Strawberries, cherries, cherries and grape, grape, Mother!
Shri Mataji: Grape is the best.
[Laughter]
Alexandre: You have to bless it, Mother.
Shri Mataji: That’s the real thing. You just bring that.
That’s all. This is not sufficient.
You bring it here, bring it here.
So now, this is the ultimate puja we have done now. This is the end of the puja, it’s finished. Throw all that in there. All the, all the remaining things are to be thrown.
Yes, put it.

Now, we have put today the grapes in it. That means the grapes will lose their capacity to ferment.
[Laughter]

That’s the best. Ah, the wind is blowing now. So, let’s then have our lunch and do the Puja inside as outside it’s very cold. [Inaudible]
The main thing was to have the havan today
[Hindi].
Alexandre: Mother, the dinner is not ready.
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Alexandre: The lunch is not ready.
Shri Mataji: Not ready, is it?
Alexandre: Not, yes. In one hour, in one hour.
Shri Mataji: So, we’ll finish the puja.
Alexandre: Yes, Mother.
