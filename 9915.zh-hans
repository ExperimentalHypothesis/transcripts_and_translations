[Starts at 9:04]
Shri Mataji: Hello, so we were waiting for you to come here. So, I think, I’ll get my sweater. Hello, we were waiting for you to come, for Christopher to come here. How is he? Very good. What’s happened to his head?
Marie-Amélia: Changing of milk, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: So, Christopher you are back, here? Oh, oh, oh...
You must cover his head. It’s very cold still.
All right. All right. All right. What’s the matter?
He is in meditation. [Baby complains] No, no, no, no, no.
[Shri Mataji rocks the baby]
You must keep him close, all the time. Better cover him more. All right, you’ll get something more from inside. I think you also wear your sweater or something. It’s rather cold outside.
Marie-Amélia: Thank you, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Just cover him much more on the head.
Gregoire: This is a present from the Austrian Sahaja Yogis, Austrian Sahaja Yogis to the French Sahaja Yogis.
Shri Mataji: Ah! It’s beautiful.
Gregoire reads the word on the poster: “And I saw heaven opened and behold a white horse”. Shri Mataji: Translate it in French.
At last I was to bring My sweater. Geneviève can bring.
Gregoire: Sweater for Shri Mataji.

Michel C.: Mother I have a gift, two gifts for you.
Shri Mataji: I beg your pardon?
Michel C.: First is from Rouen we offer You the cushion where your feet are settled. It’s from Rouen. And the "armours" [city coat of arms] of the town.
Shri Mataji: Oh, I see. What’s this?
Michel C.: The blazon of the town of Rouen.
Shri Mataji: What’s that?
Michel C.: The blazon of the city, of Rouen.
Shri Mataji: And what are these marks about?
Michel C.: Three lilies.
Shri Mataji: Lilies?
Michel C.: Lilies. I think it’s like a lotus in France, in old kingdom.
Shri Mataji: Beautiful. Thank you very much.
Michel C.: No thank you, Mother.
Shri Mataji: So, can you keep it? Thank you.

It’s quite cold still. The wind will blow away the clouds. As soon as I came out here, it plays, you see, it plays some tricks with you all the time.
[Laughter]
Yes, better have him covered. And you too wear something warm.
I hope you are all warm enough.

很高兴看见这样多的霎哈嘉瑜伽修习者,他们许多是新来的,但对我来说却一点都不陌生,也许千年以前我已认识你们。

[Shri Mataji is laughing] You are sitting in the sun.

在霎哈嘉瑜伽,你们要知道一件很简单的事情,你们都是永恒的灵,凡不属灵的都不是你们自己。

我们可以太阳来作比喻,乌云可以把太阳掩盖,乌云可以把太阳包裹起来,但太阳还是存在于那里。你们不能照亮太阳,只有太阳能照亮它自己。如果一旦乌云散去,没有了遮盖,太阳便能照耀天际。同样我们的灵(Spirit)为无知所掩盖,这个掩盖仍在,我们便看不见灵体。即使只有几朵乌云,那障碍还是存在的。我们要有晴朗的天空,永恒的灵才能照耀。我们有许多方法可以去除那些乌云。

首要的是我们的信心,我们要相信自己是个永恒的灵,其余的都是施设(Superimposition)。你们要内在这样相信。在得到自觉以后,这应该是不难的。你们要相信,你比你所知道的自己要多,你的真我是很不同的。

现在的情况已是不同,你们这种信心不是盲目的信心,而是从经验得来的。因此你们的头脑 (Intellect)不要对抗。如果你们的头脑开始对抗,而你们又听信它的话,你便会降回去。就好像科学家,即使只是惊鸿一瞥地看见一颗明星,他们也会相信那星是真正存在的。同样,即使你只能在一瞬间感觉到你的自觉,你也至少要相信,你是个永恒的灵。你要继续把注意力放在这个经验上,告诉你的头脑不要再欺骗你,这样你便可以摆脱你的头脑。

这时你的头脑便会开始为追求成为永恒的灵而工作,这就是信心。信心能生出纯洁的头脑。你看见过乌云的确是可以去除之后,即使还有些乌云剩下来,你也知道可以用强风,即那圣灵的风驱散它。这风是从外面来的,它来自圣灵的力量,亦即是我们的灵量。同时你们还有太初灵量的力量在你们之前,和过去那些求道者比较起来,你们是十分幸运。

因为崇拜那些神像(Vigraha),崇拜那些母亲大地所造的,含有能量的石像是会引起很大问题。这些人首先要做一种叫Sarvikalpa Samadhi的初步静坐冥想,把注意力放在那个神像之上。神像的意思便是含有生命能量的塑像,然后不断凝望此塑像,尝试提升灵量。通常这样做只能使灵量上升至宽恕轮,却无法到达自觉轮,因为要超越这一步,我们要从「有形相」进到「无形相」,这一步是很难的,即使是把注意力放在抽象或「无形相」上都很难。回教和其他许多宗教都试图这样做。由于困难若此,所以「无形相」要化为「有形相」,这时便一点都不复杂了。只要你们把注意力放在有形之上,便能成为无形。就好像有一块冰放在你们前面,你们用手去触摸它,冰便融化,你们便会感觉到冰的清凉。

因此现在这个问题很简单的便解决了。崇拜便是你们可以通过有形到达无形的方法。你们每一个能量中心之上,都有神祇驻守在那里,祂们是无形而来的有形。当你们作崇拜时,有形便化作无形的能量,此无形的能量流动,便成为风,这时那些遮盖灵体的乌云障碍都得以去除。

在崇拜中,你们不要去思考分析,这些都是超越思维的。因此你们要知道,不能将崇拜理性化。你们应该让轮穴得到最大的好处。要得到这些好处,你们崇拜时要专心,感应凉风的流动,凉风便会自动去除那些乌云。所以你唯一要做的是要专心,好像是旁观者那样毫不执着的去静观一切。

你们都是些见者(Seer),见者有两个意义。一是他只是静观,他便成为知识,其间没有任何思想,没有任何反应,只是静观,便能自然而然地吸收。有时,我会觉得是个负担,因为你们与神祇之间应该有分际,要有平衡。

你们念诵那些口诀,神祇都被你们唤醒了,但你们却不愿开放心灵去接收,于是变成我是唯一一个要把能量储存起来的人。这些能量都是从我身体中释放出来的。所以如果你们能开放心灵,不要思考,只是观看,那就好得多了。今天我们会把次序对调,先作火祭(Havana),然后作崇拜,这样会好些。因为火祭可以唤起火元素的力量,烧掉那些邪恶。当你们为我沐足时,也是同样道理,你们做火祭也是同样道理。

今天我们会先做火祭,然后作崇拜,二者是一样的。你们可以通过火元素或水元素来崇拜我。火元素的本质是那焰光,作火祭时所有那些不洁,邪恶都会被烧为灰烬,你们的脸上,身体周围都会发出光芒,同时周围环境也会充满美丽的能量。

So, I think best thing will be to do the havan first and then the puja.

May God bless you all!

Of course, always we have to praise Ganesha before starting any puja, so you start praising Shri Ganesha.

Alexandre: Mother, we have learned the Ganesha "Atvatham Shirsham".
Shri Mataji: Atharva, Atharvashirsha. Ganesha Atharvashirsha.
Alexandre: Then we’ll say in French, or in English, I don’t know, up to You.
Shri Mataji: All right, say it in French.
Or better to translate it because there are other people.
Alexandre: OK.
Shri Mataji: First English and then French.
Alexandre: And first, in Sanskrit we don’t say, Mother?
Shri Mataji: It’s all right, I can understand English all right.
[Laughter]
It’s all mantras for Me to understand.
Alexandre: Shri Ganesha. Om tawme wa sakchat, Shri Ganesha sakchat, Shri Adi Shalti Mataji, Shri Nirmala Devi namoh namaha
The holy mantra of Shri Mataji. [The three great mantras]
[Ganesha Atharvashirsha in English and in French]

Shri Mataji: Beautiful. Voice is very beautiful. It’s good. All right, now.
Right now we’ll be having the fire. It’s all right.

Shri Mataji: Now, how do you make it [inaudible]
Alexandre: There’s already some, it’s behind.
Camila, there’s some work for you to do.
Come along. You can look after the fire.
Let others see the fire.
Alexandre: Mother, [first should] we recite Your names or names of Shri Vishnu?
Vishnu, Vishnu’s names?
Shri Mataji: Yes, Vishnu’s names.
Alexandre: 108 names of Vishnu?
Shri Mataji: It would be better Vishnu’s names.
Have you got 1000 names?
Alexandre: Not, 108 names.
Shri Mataji: Devi’s?
Alexandre: Devi’s we can go.
Marie: The Devi’s names Mother we have a translation in French
Alexandre: 108. Mother is asking for 1000. We have Lalita Sahasranama.
Shri Mataji: But who knows Sanskrit? It’s in Hindi?
Alexandre: It’s written in French.
Shri Mataji: All right, then it’s all right.

Sahaja Yogi: The vibrated Kumkum.
Shri Mataji: Now you put some water in it and put it to all the people, now.
Today I would say that from France those who came to see Me, from all these places, one from each centre should come forward.

One from Britany.
These are too big, I think. You can put the bigger ones to make a triangle first, downward. The bigger ones.

Maria? The triangle on the three sides.
Marie: Where do they come Mother, for the havan?
Shri Mataji: One on top of another, this be better. Yes, it’s closer, yes, that’s why.

Sahaja Yogini: Would You like some tea or?
Shri Mataji: Yes, it would be nice
Sahaja Yogini: More than water, you don’t want water, yes Mother.

Shri Mataji: No, no, no, something like a [inaudible] paper like thing, lighter.
Is that the light thing? And have you got camphor with you? Something lighter to be, underneath.
You don’t have anything. Make it smaller, smaller here, yes.
Put it on top of this thing, not underneath. Not underneath, put it on top.
Covering this. Yes, put these on top.
Yes, like that, yes, that’s the right thing.

You have to keep a hole in between. Arrange it in such a way there is a hole in between, in the centre.

All right, now arrange on top of this. Now, this is all right. Please cover with this [inaudible]. I think there should be a platform first. There should be a platform first and then, in the centre there should be a platform.
Yes, make a platform there, yes, down here, yes, that’s it. And on the platform- just wait, Marcus, on the platform you put another thing. That’s better, yeah. Do you have some more with you? All right. Like that, yes.
To begin with that’s sufficient.
That’s all.

Alexandre: Mother we have Vishnu Sahasranama Stotram and Shri Lalita.
Shri Mataji: But it should be in Sanskrit.
Alexandre: No, there is, also here it’s written in...
Shri Mataji: You can read that.
Alexandre: Yes.
Shri Mataji: So.
Alexandre: This is Vishnu’s names.
Shri Mataji: You’d like to do 108, yes? What we’ll do, we can do 108 of the Goddess and 108 of Shri Vishnu, that’s the best.
Alexandre: All right, Mother. All right.

Shri Mataji: And one from Paris also should be there, a new person.
Alexandre: A new person yes.

Shri Mataji: From Paris, someone. 58:36
Shri Mataji: Children, please, you’d better now [inaudible].
Marie: Mother?
Shri Mataji: Yes.
Marie: We have the 108 names translated in French in the form of a poem.
Shri Mataji: Oh. Where?
Marie: Here.
Shri Mataji: [Inaudible]
Now, can you put something for Me there?
Alexandre: You want to sit here, on the chair?
Shri Mataji: You tell them also; I’ll guide them better.
Some chair.
Vanessa you come here, you come and sit here, this side.
You come this side. All the children can sit next to Me.
I’m worried about it.
[Cut in the video] 59:53
Alexandre: Shall we say the mantra for the fire, Mother?
We have to say together Shri Agni Devata, who is the Devi-
Shri Mataji: Be careful about it. Don’t be too near. Little further, it’s moving all the time.
Now say the mantra.
Alexandre: Shri Agni Devata who is a Devi, the aspect of fire in Shri Mataji.
[Collective mantra]
Shri Swaha Swamini who is a principle of-
Shri Mataji: No, no. What’s the?
Alexandre: Swaha Swamini.
Shri Mataji: OK. Swa-ha.
Swaha is the quality of the, of the fire which consumes everything. Swa-ha.
[Collective mantra]

Shri Mataji: Now, after every name that he takes, you have to take the thing from your hand like this, and take it round to the right side and put it in the fire. But those who haven’t got these things in the hand should take up just their hand like that, thinking that they have it in their hand, and moving it upward like that and put it in the fire. And you all should say “Swaha”. Now, just a minute. After every name, after every name.
Alexandre: The 108 names of Shri Vishnu. First, Mother, it’s all right?
Shri Mataji: First the Devi.
Alexandre: First the Devi, sorry.
OM twame wa sakchat Shri Mata namaha
OM, Swaha
OM twame wa sakchat Shri Maharajni namaha
OM, Swaha...

Shri Mataji: Now we’ll do the Vishnu Sahasranama, hundred and eight. Again, you distribute the rice, distribute it.
Alexandre: Is it enough, Mother?
Shri Mataji: Beg your pardon?
Alexandre: Is it enough, it should be made quickly, the names?
Shri Mataji: What’s the time now?
Alexandre: The time?
Marie: It’s 2 o’clock, Mother.
Alexandre: 2 pm. We have only to be at 6.30 in Paris later on. But You don’t need to be there as early. We can arrive before You and we can give a practical session to the people. Explain them to [inaudible].
Shri Mataji: Then you should come at 6 pm.
Alexandre: Yes, that’s true.

Shri Mataji: You see, these people want to be there only for their body.
Alexandre: Yes, that’s true.
Shri Mataji: One fellow, he has got back pain.
Alexandre: Yes, something like that.
Shri Mataji: He’s the only one who had. You bring the oil and all that and you can massage him.
Alexandre: Yes, all right, Mother. We’ll give him a treatment. No problem. I think we can manage.
Shri Mataji: You would like to do 108 [inaudible]
Alexandre: Some people can go there and give them a practical session Mother, on how to meditate in Sahaja Yoga, how to work on themselves.
Shri Mataji: So, I think, 21 names of Vishnu are sufficient.
Alexandre: All right, Mother. OK.
[Collective mantras]

Shri Mataji: OK. What you call the finishing part of it [inaudible]. For that you have to use some sort of a fruit. Last thing. Would you have something? What is the special fruit of France?
Alexandre: The special fruit of France? Apples!
Shri Mataji: Apples, or you should have...
Alexandre: Strawberries, cherries, cherries and grape, grape, Mother!
Shri Mataji: Grape is the best.
[Laughter]
Alexandre: You have to bless it, Mother.
Shri Mataji: That’s the real thing. You just bring that.
That’s all. This is not sufficient.
You bring it here, bring it here.
So now, this is the ultimate puja we have done now. This is the end of the puja, it’s finished. Throw all that in there. All the, all the remaining things are to be thrown.
Yes, put it.

Now, we have put today the grapes in it. That means the grapes will lose their capacity to ferment.
[Laughter]

That’s the best. Ah, the wind is blowing now. So, let’s then have our lunch and do the Puja inside as outside it’s very cold. [Inaudible]
The main thing was to have the havan today
[Hindi].
Alexandre: Mother, the dinner is not ready.
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Alexandre: The lunch is not ready.
Shri Mataji: Not ready, is it?
Alexandre: Not, yes. In one hour, in one hour.
Shri Mataji: So, we’ll finish the puja.
Alexandre: Yes, Mother.

H.H. Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi
