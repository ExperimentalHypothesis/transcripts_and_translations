Public Program

I bow to all the seekers of the truth. At the very outset we have to know that truth is what it is . You cannot change it, you cannot transform it and you cannot pay for it. We are all seekers of truth. What are we seeking perhaps you do not know. Whatever I am going to tell you today you should not accept it blind folded. But you must keep your mind open like scientist and if it is proved then you better accept as honest people. Because it is for the benevolence of yourself, your family, your country and the whole world. We have become human beings at this level but still little more has to happen to us. In the evolutionary process we have to jump little more. All the problems of modern times are because we are confused. To get rid of the confusion you have to become the spirit. Christ has said “know thyself”. Also Mohammad Sahib has said “the one who does not know himself is still at an animal stage”. All these great incarnations and prophets has said “you have to be born again”. But that doesn't mean you just say that you are born again and put a sort of a sign board. Born again means actualisation of this experience firstly. Or else not only that but you have powers of your own which are manifested. We say that this is my house, this is my head, this is my body; all my my my my my. But who is the owner of this my. Who is this I . that is the spirit which has not yet manifested in our life. Is reflected in our heart and is watching us but yet not come into our attention to enlighten us. When you become the spirit then you know yourself what are you. Then you realise you are not this body, this mind this emotions, this ego or conditionings. But you are pure spirit. So now we have to be the spirit. Thats how you get your self knowledge. That is what is called as self realisation. It is the evolutionary process which is the living process. As we sow the seed in the mother it sprouts by itself spontaneously. In the same way it happens. We have evolved without doing anything. We didnt pay to anyone, we didn't join any organisation we just pick up. And these are special times. Because I call it as a blossom time. Because there are so many flowers so many seekers, and now they have to become the fruits. Now as it is you have seen here (somebody has talked about kundalini ?… alright). You have been already told about the subtle system within us. The left side channel that you see here looks after the left side sympathetic nervous system and right side looks after the right side system and the central one is the parasympathetic nervous system. We have chakras just like this. From the left and the right and you have the energy centres in between. There are seven energy centres, main ones. So this power you see down below as kundalini is the fifth power. Left side right side sympathetic nervous system, then parasympathetic nervous system and whatever we have achieved in our evolution is the fourth one which we call as central nervous system. Now the fifth one is this one which is in a dormant state. When it is awakened then it passes through our fontanelle bone area lastly and connects you to the all pervading power of divine love. We see these beautiful flowers but we never even think how they are created by mother earth. These beautiful flowers are there because the same all pervading power looks after them. Who runs our heart if you ask the doctor, they say it is autonomous nervous system. But who is this auto, who manages our digestion. So the answer is in becoming the spirit. All the religions have failed mainly because they are money oriented or power oriented. They are not spirit oriented. Money has nothing to do. God does not understand money. It is the human headache. He doesn't understand your banking. So we have to go into the realm of his kingdom. We live on the cusps of our thoughts which come to you from past or the future. But you cannot be in the present. But when these kundalini rises she makes this thoughts long like this and there is a space in between. There you become thoughtlessly aware. You are aware and there is no thought to bombard your head. That is how you achieve your piece. Many people have been awarded piece (award); I see they have no piece within themselves. How can you talk of piece when there is no piece within oneself. So when you get your self realisation the first thing happens to you that you become thoughtlessly aware. That means all these modern problems stress and strain just vanish and you just relax. You watch the whole drama like a witness. And once, you see, you can see your problems you can solve them much better. And also there is a divine help as blessings. Because we are not connected with the divine power we are like a kite which is lost its ???. But once you have the self realisation you understand that you are being glorious, very powerful. And your power is of love and compassion. Then the second thin happens to you is that you become collectively conscious. Because after self realisation your hand starts ??. Mohammad sahib has said that at the time of resurrection your hands will speak. So on your finger tips you know what centre you are catching what centres others are catching because you become collective, you become universal being. You know about yourself and you know about others. If you know how to correct yourself you can correct others also. See, all your physical, mental, emotional, I would say even financial, political all these problems are based upon these centres. When this kundalini rises she nourishes all these centres and you can get rid of your all the problems. Its so easy. Its your own power. You don't have to pay for it. No obligation. Only thing so far  you have not known yourself. Then your attention also becomes also very powerful. Wherever you put your attention you can understand your problems. And in the light of that spirit your attention takes you into realm of complete purity. No use teaching about morality. It doesn't work out. On the contrary people can only become hypocritical. But, if you become the spirit, you become; I am saying again you become moral. Just you become moral. Nobody has to tell you anything. You will be amazed in England, overnight people gave up drugs. Overnight they give up drinking smoking. And the all destructive habits were given up. Its miraculous, its fantastic. But we are now working in 65 nations. And it is spreading so well because you when you get your realisation you can giver realisation to others. You can spread it. You can give to thousands of people one person. And that is how this power spreads. There is no end to my lecturing. I must have give 5000 lectures in english language alone and many more in other languages. Its just the mental act. Why we have to go beyond the mind. So the best thing is to take your realisation. If you have any questions as I know so many questions are there you may write to me and I love to answer that. You want to ask me some questions please.

So far. What is it. Come here. You must ask me sensible question, alright.

Q: How can you cure psycho diseases ?

Shri Mataji: of course of course we can. See, all mental diseases are caused by the left side movement of this channel . If you can cure your left side you can cure all your mental problems. Its very simple. You don't have to be a doctor for that.

Q: can we influence the criminal in the right direction?

Shri Mataji: of course of course why not. But, why try criminals, why not this ordinary people. Even your genes also they change. All these tendencies come to us because of our genes. But when this kundalini rises she knows everything about every individual. She is your own mother. Your individual mother. She thinks and she understands and she can change your genes. That is how you are.

 

Q: Shri Mataji I have a question. How do you start the serpent power kundalini slept at mooladhara chakra. Do you know anybody who has awakened kundalini.

Shri Mataji:This question is nice. I was born with it. Thats why it is nothing creditable to me but creditable to you because you achieve it.

Q: back in 1978 in s? California I met swami muktananda. He was may be one

Shri Mataji:one thing you should know about all these gurus, one thing; that this muktananda had this six hundred crores worth of diamonds. And later on it came out in the newspaper that he used to rape 13 year old girls. ?? it is out , you see it was all published that in England and also america, I don't tell lies; and it was not circulated. Many people don't know even in India. But we are not here to discuss this horrible people. Forget it. Take your realisation. Thats all. Because. Its all right. It has no meaning.

Translator: she is here because Osho ?? books

Shri Mataji:Thats all. You see . Just a minute madam, what has he given you ? Do you have powers to give realisation to others ? Look at yourself, you are a liver patient. The least said about them is the best. He has confessed also, he has confessed.

This is the trouble. They have made books and books and books and you are entangled in the words.

 

Q: Did Christ apply Sahaja Yoga or something different and why was people surprised by his ability to cure. Did he practiced sahaja yoga.

Shri Mataji:Christ was an incarnation. Christ himself was a born realised soul. He was an incarnation. He was a son of God and he did not need sahaja yoga. Because he didn't have to become.

 

Q: What do you think about vegetarianism. And are you a vegetarian ?

Shri Mataji:No, I am not. I am not vegetarian. You see this isms are wrong. For some people it suits to be a vegetarian but some people it does not. If intake of protein is less then this cholesterol problem starts. Whosoever needs proteins more or carbohydrates more has to eat according to the personality. You yourself will know what is good for you. But one should not eat meat of animals which are bigger like buffalo, like horses.

 

Q: Cataract

Shri Mataji:Cataract cannot be cured because it is a dead thing. But after operation you can ??

Q: when you relieve kundalini, how can you control kundalini prana

Shri Mataji:No, this is all nonsense of kundalini prana and all that. It has nothing to do with kundalini prana. Kundalini itself is the power which knows everything. Is all nonsense thing. Money making prepositions were such that they make books that they made all this nonsense. They gave you nothing, accept for taking money from you. Moreover I must tell you that if you have been to these false gurus its difficult to give you realisation because they do something to your kundalini. So many seekers are lost. So many of them. This Rajnish (Osho), this one Osho fellow, he changed his name ten times; he made so much money, so much money that ?? big rolex watch. There is no evidence of anything good he has done so far.

Q: Sai Baba (Sathya Sai Baba )

Shri Mataji:No good. Now he is exposed. Now he is exposed thank God. No, but Sai Nath (from Shirdi)who is the old one is alright. But this (Sathya Sai Baba) is horrible.

He (Sathya Sai Baba) is exposed now very well. But the news doesn't circulate.

 

Thats your language problem. There's so many questions. Is it important ? You see those who want the truth will have it. I say that if I have done the cooking, you are hungry, you will ask for food. You have to be humble.

Q: ???

Shri Mataji:Just see what they have done. Why do you ask me what have they done. Instead of ?? money what have they done. You will be amazed in Russia we have in one program at least 18000 people. In one village, Togliatti, 21000 sahaja yogis. I never knew Russian were that sensitive; to such an extent that the University of ?, is the oldest University has given me an award, a special award which is only given to 10 people so far. One of them was Einstein. And I feel little shy about it, I say why do you want to give me. And they say that she has worked only on matter, ?? human beings. I must tell you, you don't like Russians I know but 65% of Russians are excellent people. They never followed any false gurus, never. Even now their government has thrown away all of them except for me. Surprise. There is mafia, there is everything, but still there is a sense to understand. So try to see that you should get your realisation, thats important. Thats very important. Alright. So now lets finish this and we deal with the main things.

Now one thing you should know I cannot force it on you.

 

Q: What is the role of Jesus Christ

Shri Mataji:Greatest role was played by him. Without him I could not have worked. Not only that, he has talked about me. And then it is only his desire I am here. You have to recognise me after self realisation. You people follow Christ is alright but today I am before you not Christ. When Christ came they said what about Moses. And when Moses came they said what about Abraham. You have to live in the present thats what human being don't do. Because of that all religions have failed. We have to follow Christ in the true sense and know what work he has done. Christ is very important. Where does he reside, here, optic chasma, cross. But we don't follow him. Only the Christians are fighting with muslims are fighting with jews are fighting with hindus are fighting. They are just fighting. Thats all. Christ religion cannot be exclusive. Even Mohammad sahib's religion cannot be exclusive. Mohammad talk of Abraham, of Moses, of Christ and his mother much more than the Bible. There are so many things which you will understand how we are crucifying Christ everyday. One thing for sure, after self realisation what Christ has asked we will have it. He has said “though shall not have adulterous eyes”. I have not any one in the Christian country where they have pure eyes. There is no innocence. This will happen to you when you get your self realisation. I am here to fulfill his desires. And you will know much about him once you learn what you are. Whats happening, I am myself born in the christian family; and we find now the priests are having relationship with women, and they are printing what you call counterfeit money in Rome. They have no right to talk about Christ. There attention is not on the spirit. To think of Christ itself is so peaceful. But bible was changed because of Paul. He never respected women. And thats why in the west I find women have no respect. Then women become aggressive. But women are the potential power. In England Church ?? , they don't allow women to be the priest even catholics; is absurd, is unfair. Even Christ has said on the cross “behold the mother”. I am sorry for the women of the west. They have to always dress up in such a way that they should always look attractive to men, they have to please them all the time. Sometime ?? it to prostitution. Its a very sad affair the way they have interpreted christ. Now the time has come for you to put him up in his proper personality. I am sorry I have to talk so much of christ but all over the world in Sahaja yoga, people worship Christ, worship christ; whether they are muslims, jews, hindu, christians; they worship. I am happy that you are so enamoured by Christ, but now you better do what he has told you to know yourself.

You can take out your shoes if you want because the mother earth helps us a lot. Now, we have three conditions which are very simple. As I told you I cannot force on you, it cannot be forced. So you have to have pure desire to get your self realisation. The second condition is that you have to forgive everyone as Christ has told. Because whether you forgive or don't forgive, what do you do ? You do nothing. But when you don't forgive then you play into wrong hands. You torture yourself for nothing at all. So first of all just say that “I forgive everyone “ in you heart, which is a myth. Then the third condition is that you have to forgive yourself. That we say in our Lord's prayer “forgive our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us”. So you have to forgive yourself as well as others. Just to say within your heart. These are the three simple conditions. Now we will show you how you can nourish your centres. We will show you and then you will have to close your eyes. The spirit resided in your heart. So please put your right hand on your heart. Right hand is for your action. Those who don't want to do should leave the hall please because you shouldn't disturb others. So put your left hand towards me which mean you have a desire to have your realisation. Put on your lap. Put both the feet on the ground straight and the left side is the power of desire, mundane desire. That is why you have to keep both the feet apart from each other. Now, he will show you, that first you put your hand on your heart. Here resides the spirit. Now, if you become the spirit, you become your own guide, your own master. So now, you put your hand, we work on your left side. Now please put your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on left hand side. Show them also on that side. Now surprisingly the pure knowledge of divine, for that the centre is here in the lower portion of your abdomen; which goes into jeopardy when you follow wrong masters. Lower portion. Now again raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen. Then raise it on your heart. Now please put your right hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder and turn your head to your right. This centre you catch when you feel guilty and you don't forgive yourself. This causes, this cases spondylitis and also it can give you a disease called angina of the heart. So why not forgive yourself at this moment. Now raise your right hand on top of your head, on the forehead and put down your head. Here you have to forgive others without thinking of any individual because it is headache. Bed your heads. Now please put the right hand backside of your head and push back your head. Here without counting your mistakes, without feeling guilty you have to ask forgiveness from the divine power just for your satisfaction. Now the most important is the last centre where you get your baptism, actualisation of baptism. Now please put your right hand, the palm of your right hand, on top of the fontanelle bone area which was the soft bone in your childhood. Now bend your head as far as possible. Now stretch back your fingers. Put down your head please. Now you move your scalp not your head, push back your fingers, pressure, seven times, clockwise. Press it here. Now thats all we have to do with closing eyes. Now before closing eyes see that your feet are apart from each other. Please take down your hands. Now put left hand towards me and right hand on the heart. Here you have to ask a fundamental question about yourself after closing your eyes. Don't press your eyes, just close them as you do it when you sleep. Now here resides the spirit. So in your heart you ask me a question, you can call me Mother or Shri Mataji. Please ask “Mother am I the spirit “ as three times in your heart. Now I have already told you that if you become the spirit you become your own master, your own guide. So please put your right hand in the upper portion of the abdomen and ask a question in your heart, it is a fundamental question so ask three times “Mother am I my own master “. I have already told you that self realisation cannot be forced on you. Nor the pure knowledge of the divine. You have to ask for it. So now please put your right hand in the lower portion of the abodomen on the left hand side and ask me 6 times “Mother please give me pure divine knowledge”. Now ask 6 times. As soon as you ask this question the kundalini rises. But you have to enlarge your higher with your self confidence. So please raise your right hand in the upper portion of the abdomen on the left hand side. Here you have to say ten times with full confidence “Mother I am my own master “. I have already told you about your spirit that you are the spirit. That unless and until you become the spirit you have not got your perfection, perfection in spirituality. Now raise your right hand on your heart and here you have to say twelve times with full confidence “Mother I am the pure spirit“. This all pervading power of divine love is the ocean of knowledge. It is the ocean of compassion and bliss. But above all it is the ocean of forgiveness. And whatever mistakes you might have committed can be easily dissolved in this ocean of compassion. So now please forgive yourself. And please put your right hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder and turn your head to your right. Here you have to say sixteen times “Mother I am not guilty at all”. I have requested you that you have to forgive everyone in general, not thinking about them. Because whether you forgive or you don't forgive you don't do anything. At this moment if you don't forgive the centre of christ itself will not open, though so many of you believe in Christ you don't forgive. Thats why this centre is catching. So now please raise your right hand on top of your forehead across, and put down your head. Here you have to say only from your heart, not to count “Mother I forgive everyone in general”; from your heart. Also for your satisfaction you have to ask forgiveness from this all pervading power. So now please put the right hand on the backside of your head and push back your head. Here without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes you have to ask forgiveness from the divine power. So please say “Oh Divine Power, if I have done anything wrong knowingly or unknowingly please forgive me.

1.16.19

Its again you have to say from your heart, not how many times. Now the last centre is very important through which the kundalini emerges out. She nourishes all the centres and she joins you to the all pervading power.  So now stretch you palms fully and put the centre of the palm on top of your fontanelle bone are and now bend your head as much as you can. Now stretch your fingers, have a proper pressure. You have to move it seven times clockwise but, I cannot force self realization on you.  You have to ask for it. So while moving your palm on the scalp please say “Mother please give a self realization” in all humility. You cannot get self realization if you are arrogant, one has to humble down. Now please bend your head.  Now please take down your hands and open  your eyes slowly. Now please put both the hands towards me. With the right hand towards me, you just bend your head and see for your self if there is cool or hot breeze like thing coming out on the fontanelle bone area, you have to move it you see, move forward, bend your head, it feels there. Now put your left hand towards me like this, again bend your head and see with the right hand. If there is hot breeze coming from your head then know that you have not forgive others and yourself. Please bend  your head and see. Now again once more with the right hand, some might get it closer, some might away. Now please put both your hands towards the sky and bend back, bend your head put it back. Here you have to ask a question in your heart “Mother is this the cool breeze of the holy ghost “ or another question you can ask “Mother is this the all pervading power of the divine love?” or another question “Mother is this the paramachaitanya ?”. now take down your hands please. Both the hands towards me. Some people get it from here (back of hand/palm), they should bring it back like that. Now watch me without thinking, just  watch me without thinking; you can do it.  Now those who have felt cool breeze or hot breeze on their fingers or on their hands or out of the fontanelle bone area please raise both your hands.  See all of you have got it except for very few. ?? . I bow to you because now all of you have become saints. Now only thing you have to know is how to use this power. Please put down the  hands. May be somebody who is sick may not get, somebody is too much mental may not get. It is very few who didn’t get. So now a new life has started. In the Sanskrit language we call a realized soul as dwijah. Also a bird I called dwijah. Because the bird is twice born. First its an egg and then it becomes a bird. That’s how it has happened. Now you have become birds but still you have to meditate every night ten minutes to see that all shackles ??? . next year again I will try to come and I am sure it will work out. When I come all of you come but when I am not there all of you don’t come. There is no money to be offered or anything, but you have to give time. You have to give some time to yourself for your growth and that will help you a lot to be able to grow spiritually. We have some very good sahaja yogis and people are coming from some other countries here. See the Romanians have come all the way. Now  a day should come when you all can go abroad. That should happen to all of you.  May God bless you all, may God bless you.

 

You got it I am very happy because Muktanandas….

Q : what about Swami Shivananda, they follow, lime light society 6 years ago

Shri Mataji:nonsense. This is divine love. You have to feel it. Actualisation, not talking, just actualization. Alright?

Yes !

Shri Mataji: you see Indians are very clever and I don’t know they have made lots of money. Indians (sadhus/gurus)  are very clever and can be very cunning. So be careful. If Indians are good, they are very very good and if they are bad they are horrid. And this false people have come to loot you. Understand it . They don’t live in India, they go abroad, just collecting money, that’s all.
