Shri Krishna Puja. Nasik (India), 19 January 1985.

I would like to tell you what was My announcement. Yesterday in the lecture I gave a new announcement about Sahaja Yoga. But the whole lecture was in Marathi language. And before it is translated I would like to tell you what is my announcement. 

There was a question that in America and in England no trust which is not a religion can be registered. Of course, Sahaja Yoga is the religion no doubt, is the universal religion. It is the religion that integrates all the religions, brings all the principles of religions together and shows the oneness. It integrates all the incarnations; it integrates all the scriptures. It's a very integrating, great religion which we can call as the universal religion. And in Hindi it is called as Vishwa Dharma.

Now, to make it more particular, I thought that if you say, "Universal Religion," then it may not be that particular. Because like the Buddhists, then we have got people who are called after Christ as Christians and after other people according to the incarnation. So this time the incarnation being Nirmala, I thought we can call it the religion which is universal in the name of Nirmala. So, to make it short I thought we can call it Universal Nirmala Religion. What do you say to that?

Now, Nirmala, you'll be all called as Nirmalites. Means the ones who have been enlightened by Nirmala. It goes light, the word light goes very well with you people because you are enlightened. Others are just lights without any flame. So, this is Nirmalites, means the ones who are being enlightened by Nirmala. So, if you like the name we can call it Universal Nirmala Religion. If that suits your people in the West, I think that's a good name. So we have now proclaimed and pronounced that this is a religion, which is a pure universal religion. When you say universal Nirmala means pure or immaculate religion. And I hope you are agreeable to that.

Now, when we accept that religion, once we become universal, then we have to forget about our small little caste, customs, our old dead traditions and the things that are not keeping with our spirit. Whatever is comfortable to your spirit has to be accepted as the principle of our religion. And whatever is not comfortable for it, we are not going to accept.

So, whatever is the way I have taught you, these are My teachings. Out of My teachings, whatever you have achieved belongs to this religion. Of course in this religion, as you know, all the great prophets are really respected. The best advantage of this religion is: so far all the religions, although they were true religions, were established by true people and prophets, were all ruined by their disciples. The reason was they were not given realization, firstly. And secondly, there was no proof of that religion.

Now we can give them the proof of everything. Of how it is doing good to your body. Once you know that you can prove it that it does good to you, then people will take to this religion much faster and they can test it. Because the word "religion" makes people quite nervous. They think religion means you are binding and then you have to get into some sort of a traditional style of living which is dead. But here our traditions are that we accept which are comfortable for our spirit and for our ascent. So, that gives us the complete freedom to enjoy ourselves in the fullest way. Under these circumstances, we forget what country we come from, what caste we come from, what families we come from. All these past things we forget and we become new blossoming lotuses spreading our beautiful fragrance all over the world. So, all these old ideas which are just curbing our progress should be given up.

Now I told them another thing, that we are three types of people in this world mainly divided into. One are people who are tamasik, another people who are the rajasik, and the third person is the one who is called as sattwika. Now tamasik are the people as we say that they take wrong things, attach attention more to the wrong things and then waste all their life. They will - say for example, a woman, she gets attached to her son. She gets so much attached to that son that that covers all entire activities. Her whole life is covered with that, which is a wrong thing. It can be anything. Like I've seen most of the Sahaja yogis when they came, "Mother, please treat my sister; please treat my father; treat my husband, my husband." "My husband" is very common.

So, all these things are absolutely frivolous and flippant. So, those people who indulge into such petty things which are wrong, and waste their life, are the people who are tamasika. So, that's one extreme. The goodness about it is that such people are loving, they are affectionate, they are kindly, they are not aggressive. But, they are so much attached to their family life and family things that to them it's only the family and nothing else. Now these people being extremely left-sided have much more children than normal. That's why in India we have much more children.

Now the another style is the western style. Is called the rajasik. Now the rajasik are the people who are the ones who do not know what is right and wrong. They think they are the wisest in the whole world. And they said, "This is also good; that is also good. A satan is also good and God is also good." They go on like this, you see, as if they are very generous people, they are very kindly, trying to show off. But such people become extremely right-sided; especially their woman become very right-sided. As soon as the woman become right-sided, the men lose their potency, I should say, because the woman start dominating them all the time. So men become just like cabbages. You see that very clearly. And the women decide for everything. They'll sit on their heads. They'll take a decision and the men start accepting everything, "All right, all right," because they want peace at any cost.

But there is nothing like "right" so they are confused. You ask anybody, "I'm confused!" They are not ashamed to say that also. In India, if somebody says, "I'm confused," they'll say, "Go to the lunatic asylum." But they say, "I'm confused." Because by that they try to show that "I'm very aware, because I'm confused." You see? That's not the sign; you must know the right path. How are you confused? If you don't know the right path then something's wrong with your brain. And that's what happens, that the people as a result of this not deciding this, not deciding that, all the time wavering. "This is good, that is good. Should I do this, or should I not do that?" They become really stupid sometimes. To them it's all right if they have to puncture their cheeks with nails, or some pins or something like that which you call as punks or something. "That's also good; it's all right." After," What's wrong, what's wrong? Let them all be punks." You see? All sorts of stupid, idiotic things they do and they become such idiots, I tell you. And for them nothing is wrong. They will aggress another person. They'll go and aggress other countries, and do all kinds of dominating, aggressive acts without feeling there's anything wrong in them. They lose all their guidelines. There's no discretion, there is no guideline and they don't know how to go. It's like a lost ship, you see. But still, the worst part of it is that they say, "What's wrong?" I mean, if he is lost, still he is happy going to hell directly. That sort of a mentality develops and it's very dangerous.

Here now, and actually with this kind of right-sided people they do not produce children much. They don't produce. That's why all these western countries are on the minus side, because love part is missing. To them love is also mechanical. Love is also a sort of a thing, "Let me think, then I will love." Then they will write it down. I don't know what they do for their love also, must be planning how to love. They lose all spontaneity. Being so much mechanised and thinking, they lose all the spontaneity of all the normal things, and that's how they are like that. All the time they are confused they say, "Oh, have I done right? Have I done wrong? Should I do like this?" And they cannot enjoy anything. Because even if there is something you give them to eat, then they'll think, "is it good or bad?" Eat it! See for yourself; your tongue will tell you. But tongue also does the same, I think, in their case. It's such a confused state they are in, they cannot enjoy their marriages; they cannot enjoy their family life; they cannot enjoy anything. They are absolutely joyless. And in the pursuit of joy, they do all kinds of nonsensical things which are so stupid and so idiotic and so adharmic, still they are never joyous. They'll say, "I am very joyous." Certified.

All such clowns you must have seen around. So now we don't belong to those clown states. So now let us stand up and say that we know what is right and what is wrong. Don't stand wavering. If you are wavering like that, then you are not a sahaja yogi. Now stand on right path say that "This is it and I am going to do this." If you know that, know that you are sattwikas, then you are in the center.

So you neither too much attached to your family, this, that. Neither you are too much attached to your own thinking and understanding, but you are in the center where neither you think nor you worry. But you stand in the center to enjoy the present moment which is to be enjoyed. And so, this is a spontaneous thing that has to come. Now there's a big cry for spontaneity in the West. How can they have spontaneity? They cannot have spontaneity, that's why they think if they pierce a little bit some sensation is there is good. They go in for sensation. Even in the newspaper they must have everyday some sensation. Because they are absolutely deadened with this kind of indecision. So now you decide, and the decision only can come in a person who has developed that wisdom through understanding of Sahaja Yoga through its Kundalini, that you have to stand in the center.

Even in the case of marriage, even if you marry them. After that, "I wonder, Mother, if I could carry on with her or with him."

I said, "Why? Why are you wondering that?'

"I think, Mother ..."

Oh, that's your wife! Enjoy it. I've been busy fixing up marriages. But I hope you will not neutralize all My efforts, all My trying because I still see some of them who are married look little miserable. Because you think, because you want them to be like this. They are what they are. Try to enjoy. Now why do you want to change your wife and change your husband, change everything? You married, that's the way she has to be. In any case you'll be changing as you'll be growing old.

So one must understand that at every moment how much I have enjoyed myself. That's the test of a sahaja yogi. Some people who are married must have had children before, because they've divorced. Maybe some who might have had some other attachments. Forget it. Forget it. Otherwise this miserable nature is not going to go away. So forget all that is miserable; come in the center and enjoy everything.

Now for the first time I'm venturing now to have widow marriages. In India widow marriage is something was tried long time back. People tried it, but still one can say that it was not so successful.

Now, if you have to have a universal religion you have to marry people from one place to another. You have to; that's one of the things. We call it rotibaiti, means you must eat food. In India people, you see, won't even eat food because they are so particular with whom they eat the food. Their own relations, also, in that if there is a little caste difference they will not eat food at their place. And with that, what have they achieved their starvation. They don't mind starving, but they will not eat food at a particular caste because that's a different caste. All such stupid people live here also. So this has to go away.

Gandhiji tried, before that many people tried that you must marry outside. But they didn't say in the foreign countries, otherwise they would have been murdered ten times more. But now I am saying it is now the universal religion we are talking about. So we should accept these marriages and must heed the sanctity of the marriage.

Now the ladies, I have to especially request you now that you are the one who is going to mar or make Sahaja Yoga all right. If you try to dominate your husbands and overdo things they are not going to be normal people. And I don't want cabbages here. You have to become sweet, extremely sweet nice, kindly and attentive. You see, that's how you can capture your husbands. You don't know how to capture. You are stupid women I must say. You see how we ... actually My husband, if you ask him, he will say, "I am so dependent I don't know what to do." That's what it is: absolutely dependent, hundred percent. And then sometimes he gets angry, "You made me dependent, now how can You leave me and go away?" But you people have funny ideas. You are not men, you are women. You are much more powerful than men are. But, stupidly, if you want to become less powerful, then become men. So the women should try to be little simpler, easier, kindly, compassionate, affectionate.

Let them dominate, they feel they are dominating, let them dominate. Doesn't matter. If supposing husband says, "All right, I like the blue color.' All right, you buy the green, say that "this is blue," they'll believe you. They don't know green from the blue. You see, they don't know many things. You don't know, they don't know anything about life. The things that are important to you, they don't know. They just try to say, "Do this." But they don't know anything. I mean at least our men are like that. Absolutely hopeless, they don't know anything. And if you tell them, "All right, I'm buying ..." Supposing we say that we want to plant a mango tree.

They said, "Don't have a mango tree"

"Then what should I have?"

"Ah, no. You should have another tree," some other name they'll give you.

Supposing they'll say that "Put some, say, coconut tree." Now you know that you can't plant coconut tree in a particular place. But they don't know that you cannot plant coconut tree.

So you say, "All right, I'll put coconut." Then you put the mango there.

"And what a nice coconut tree!" they'll say. And when the mangos will appear, you see, when the mangos will appear then they will look at them, "Oh, our coconut tree has given mangos. That's wonderful. Better, this is better," and then they'll laugh.

So you shouldn't... they are worried about bigger things like world peace, atomic bombs. You just don't worry about these big things. Let them worry about these big things, you see, and all. They will be worried about traffic lights, motorcars and all that. Let them worry. You worry about the things which concerns you. And you'll be surprised that this division of labor will bring more joy and more happiness.

Like the nose has to smell, mouth has to eat, ears have to hear. But if somebody.... That's what I've seen in the West that everybody does everything but his work. A president can be a garbage cleaner also. That is not done in India. Everybody has his own capacity. Of course, nothing, no work is higher or lower, but whatever is your capacity you should do accordingly. Especially with ladies and men, this is very important; and if you have not learnt how to be sweet, try to learn from some Indian women how they manage their husbands.

Now regarding the sattwikas are the people who know what the right thing is. They are actually the category of the seekers. And such seekers automatically find the truth. They are the people who come to the right thing. They have a special sense, a special seventh sense. That sense gives them understanding. What we call a very deep penetration and a pure intelligence which gives them an understanding that "this is the way it is; this isn't."

Of course some of them take time because they are left-sided or right-sided to come in the center. But even if they come to the center, they may just go to the right; they may go to the left. They may little bit go like that. But these are the people who come to Sahaja Yoga. Those who are extremes will never come to Sahaja Yoga. You should not try to pull them in. Specially men on the right, women on, too much on the right, or too much on the left. Even the men who are too much on the left, like here in Nasik I find people are so conditioned. If you are too much conditioned, then also you cannot come to Sahaja Yoga.

Now all such people even if they come to Sahaja Yoga, they'll stay for a short time and go away. That's why sometimes I say that "Such and such marriage won't be successful." One should try to understand why Mother has said it. Because they will deliberately force that marriage on Me.

"Mother, no, we want to get married, we have decided." And within three days they will come back for divorce. So one must understand why Mother has said that this won't work out. Is important, very important for us to know that there are many other things within ourselves which also work out.

Now sometimes the men also can be extremely dominating that they should not...

[Shri Mataji says aside: "Come inside. Why is he standing here?"]

They should not be dominating also. I've seen that they get very dominating. Some of the men who are married Indian girls have become so dominating that I am shocked. How did they learn it? And then try to tell the wife, "do this, do that, do that." If she doesn't do it, then they feel bad. Italians also have a habit, I have seen. They also dominating Italian women very much and the Greeks, too. Because they are supposed to be traditionalists like us, you see - Italians, Greeks and Egyptians and Indians. Indians are the worst. I cannot number the rest. But they try to dominate their women. Money they will control; this they will control; that they will control. They'll control the women; they can't control themselves. So this is what one should not try to do. That when it comes to women, you must respect them. They are respectable and if you cannot respect them, you cannot marry them and live with them.

Now these people who are very dominating, hot-tempered, puzzle type of people, they actually spoil sahaja yoginis. I've seen very good sahaja yoginis have been spoiled by such men. By marrying them sometimes I feel, "Why did I marry this good girl to this horrible fellow?" Because, first of all, the girl opposes such a man. She says, "Mother, I can't bear such a man. It's too much for me. Just he's too much, he's too rustic; he behaves in a funny manner." And then she, herself, starts behaving in the same manner. Her language changes, style changes. It's something surprising, a person who is a good sahaja yogini, extremely good sahaja yogini. We have in London; we have in America. I've seen such girls.

So, I would request you that don't try to put your tempers and all those things on your wives. Because then they react, and you will ruin their lives and their ascent as well as yours you have already ruined. Try to bring down. You have to be peaceful, loving, affectionate people.

You have no reason to have any temper whatsoever. No temper at all. So that is extremely important. You must remember that Krishna started with the temper, that how a person gets spoiled is through the temper. Temper not allowed. As soon as you get into temper, go and beat yourself with shoes. That's the best way. Or if you cannot, you can go on beating there so that no temper should be allowed to come up. Because these things will spoil Sahaja Yoga out and out. Is not allowed to have any temper whatsoever, at any cost. Except when your Mother has been... Of course there I cannot stop it because it's too much to expect. When people abuse Me, say bad things, you get into temper, doesn't matter. But even then, you need not answer them back. I'll look after them don't you worry. They'll have to pay for it.

So don't show any temper. Of course, for women it is out of question. And they should be not like matrons, like Mrs. Thatcher is. All right? Like, "Why did you not clean this? Do this, do that." They are not to say that. Not even once. You better do everything yourself. Don't tell your husband, "Do this, do that," like a servant. Don't make them into servants. It is your job to do something. It is their pleasure to help you out. Is a fact, but you will see that, that once you start doing everything they'll become your slaves.

[A yogi says, "Automatically."]

"Automatically," he says.

So because we are in a very joyous mood today, so many are getting married. You know just before you came I was late because I was arranging marriages. Now we have arranged ten marriages within this time.

So now we have to be in the center. We have to be in a joyous mood. We have to enjoy our wives and our husbands. That's the only thing that is your own, is your private, which is just something great. But don't start crying, weeping about the past. Forget the past, don't discuss it. Don't talk. No one likes it. These all romantic, nonsensical ideas, throw them away. They are all nonsensical ideas. Just start it afresh, with a great idea that you are going to start a new life of understanding and joy. Doesn't matter what your mother says, father says, anything. That's not important for us. I'm your Father, I'm your Mother, I'm your Sister, what ever you will call it. And I have given you a wife, so now you cannot blame Me for anything.

Now today, let us start afresh with this new Universal Nirmala Religion. So you are all the members of the Universal Nirmala Religion. All right? All of you agree?
