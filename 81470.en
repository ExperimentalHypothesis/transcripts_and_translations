 (England)
A long time ago, I was young, and I had the misfortune to find this guru in Hampstead. I went there for about 16 years. I met my best friend there, Magda, who became a Sahaja Yogi. This man was very doer. If you weren't already married, you were celibate; you weren't allowed to have any relationships. Through people, it was like that. In a way, it was helpful, because I was an actress, and it did keep me out of a lot of troubles that I could have got into. But anyway, I got in quite a bad state. I'd been going there for 16 years.

Then Magda, who lived in Hampstead, said, "Oh, there's a Lady Yogini coming to give a programme. Let's go." I was in such a bad state, I was so left-sided, I didn't go. It was on a Saturday, and Magda went with her daughter, Dania. Afterwards, they were full of this lady. "Oh, she's lovely. She's got lots of flowers. She holds the babies. Everybody talks to each other." I said, "It's wonderful."

So the next week, I went to Caxton Hall, and Shri Mataji wasn't there. Anyway, they sat me in the front. I sat in front of the photograph, and I had an amazing experience. I just felt everything I feel for my own mother came up in cinemascope. It was just huge.

I had this idea about Shri Mataji, that she was going to be a little lady. "Oh, come, darling, have a cup of tea." Lots of jewellery, flowers, all friendly. So I went to Caxton Hall the week after. I was sitting right in the front, as near as I am to Brenda, sitting there. And there was Mother's chair. She came in, and she wasn't anything like this little lady, covered in flowers, "have a cup of tea, dear." She looked like an opera star. She had the white. She swept in. She looked roundâ€”you know how she does sometimes? She looks like that. And I was having a very bad relationship with someone at the time. The first thing she said was, "This silly woman in New York, she's wasting her life on this worthless man. She's throwing her life away." Magda, who was sitting next to me, she went... Anyway.

To say I was awestruck is putting it mildly. Here, Mother looked like the epitome of intelligence. She had the most wonderful skin, like a child. Beautiful. And she had this garland of marigolds that she took off. Because we were sitting right there, she gave us the flowers to smell. Then she spoke. And I, well, I don't know what to say. It was just amazing. In those days, she used to get up and she'd work on everybody. And when she got to me, she put her hand on my head and she went, "Oh, the clash with the world, the heat."

Anyway, I went home. The next week, I still went to this other guru; I'd been going there for so long. And I thought, "Well, this isn't right. This isn't right." A few days later, I went to Caxton Hall again. We took a friend of ours from this meeting who was very rude to Mother, which was horrible. But at the end, when we all got up, Mother clasped my hands. She said, "Don't worry about anything. All the warmth is there. You're going to be all right." And I was far from all right. But after a few weeks, it got better. And then after that, I just never looked back. Eventually, I got married in Sahaj. I became Mother's secretary, and I spent lots of time with her. So I can never thank Mother for how much she's given me.

Question: When was your first meeting with Mother?

Answer: It was 1980. In fact, Bernard's just had his anniversary. Mine's coming up next week, I think. 16th of June, 1980.

Question: That's very nice. Would anyone like to share the funny moments of Shri Mataji? Because it was so informal in those times. There must have been so many, probably.

Answer: Yes. Could I just say something? We were sitting in her bedroom, and she was looking in the mirror. And she said to me, "You know, I have to hide who I am every minute of the day. I have to hide who I am." Of course, in those days, you didn't really get what she meant. Because it's not like it is now, where it's absolutely awesome.

Question: What did you make of it when Mother said that?

Answer: Well, I took it in. She has to. She hides who she is. And of course, she is an amazing actress. There's nobody better than her.

She took me to the bank once. She wanted to get some jewellery out because her husband was taking her to some reception. So we went into this bank, she and I, and I think there was one other person. Mother changed. She looked like some little immigrant lady. She looked very big. She had a camel coat on, she had a scarf, she looked just like a little immigrant. We went up to the counter, and the teller spoke to me as if Mother didn't understand English. So Mother said, "Yes, you talk to her. You talk to her." So then they got the strongbox out, and we went into the next room. And then all that dropped. There was Mother. She's a superb actress.

New Speaker: Yeah, I have. I went shopping with Mother once in Southall. I went shopping in London. This is quite a well-documented story of mine. We were living in the hotel in Bramham Gardens in Earl's Court. In those days, we had a housing collective in London, which I know Fergie's trying to resurrect. There was this guy who got hold of all these old properties that were up for redevelopment. He'd already got hold of one in Warwick Road, and there were a load of yogis living there. It was the first time I was going to live collectively with yogis. The night before I moved in, he said, "Oh, I've just got hold of this big hotel. You've got to move in." So Mia and myself moved into this hotel, and we were rattling around in this hotel for a couple of weeks, just the two of us with 20 bedrooms. Then Shri Mataji said she had to move out of her old house, and the new house in Brompton Square wasn't ready. So she said, "Oh, I'm moving to the hotel." Of course, immediately, the hotel filled up.

But before Shri Mataji arrived, it was a weekend of weddings. We put up all the yogis who came from abroad in this hotel, and it was the first time I experienced having to cater for a large group of people. Anyway, they all turned up on the Friday night, and we had a manic evening trying to produce food for 40 people and sorting people out and that sort of thing. The next morning, we got the message from Mother that all the brides were to go and stay at Chalfont Road that day in the evening, and all the grooms were to go off to Southall to buy curtains and pyjamas for the wedding. So suddenly, the house was empty again. We were left in this hotel on our own, twiddling my thumbs, wondering what I should do next, and probably drifting off into the left a bit.

Suddenly, the call went out, "Mother's here!" I thought, "Oh, my God." So we all rushed down into the foyer, and there, sure enough, was Mother. Not only was Mother there, but there seemed to be a load of other yogis who'd suddenly come out of the woodwork, I don't know where from. Anyway, we were standing there, and Mother had come to look over where she was going to stay when she moved in. She said, "Oh, we couldn't find my car keys anywhere. We had to come over here by taxi. And I need to go and do some shopping in Southall. Has anyone got a car?"

I was right at the back of this group of people, and I heard this voice at the front saying, "Yes, Mother, Bernard's got a car." Well, I don't know whether you could actually call it a car. It was a rusty old Mini. You don't see them in this state these days. On the floor, you could see the road. It had plants growing along in the windows. It had no suspension; the suspension was completely shot. I mean, it was just a complete wreck. I was hustled to the front. And she said, "Oh, that'll do." And I said, "Well, you surely don't want to go in this car, Mother?" And she said, "Yes." I said, "No problem, no problem."

We went out, and I was thinking, "Oh, my goodness." It was an absolute wreck, this car. Anyway, I opened the door, Mother got in, and we drove off. There was a sort of big Sahaj farewell as we drove off out the street.

Then, when we got to Southall, what's the first thing we see? A big group of Sahaja Yogis walking along the street. So Mother says, "Oh, pull over, pull over." So I pulled over, and the yogis all sort of honed in on the car. These yogis looked up and said, "Oh, who's that? It's Shri Mataji!" So they all crowded round the car. Of course, it being Southall, if there's a crowd, a crowd gathers. Suddenly, there's this huge, great crowd of people all crowded round the car, and they're all peering in, trying to see who or what's in the car.

Shri Mataji gave some instructions to the yogis as to where the best place was to go and buy some kurtas and stuff. And she said, "Right, we've got to go off." So we drove literally 40 yards up the road, parked the car, and got out. It was just me and Shri Mataji, and we went into this sari shop. No crowd. Just Shri Mataji and another Indian lady walking into this sari shop. There couldn't have been more of a contrast.

Afterwards, I remember we went to another sari shop, and Mother said, "Oh, pull over." It was a yellow line, and there was this bus right beside me. I leapt out, opening the door for Mother, and this bus stopped. The driver started swearing his head off at me. I thought, "He can't do that."
