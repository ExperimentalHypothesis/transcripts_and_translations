[Unclear]

How are you?  Are you back again?  You are all right?  Happy now. [To a child]

It is a very good speech I gave yesterday.  You must all hear it.

[Sahaja Yogi speaking]  Last night?  In the evening?  After the lecture.  Ah yes, beautiful.

All of you were there, or not?

[Sahaja Yogi speaking]  Yes!  [unclear]

How is Markandeya, is he all right?  Athena, how are you, you are all right?

The people came today from Lausanne.  They got their realisation.  There was a lady and she touched Me, and she got a shock, twice.  Like an electrical shock.  Because there was black magic on her.  And she told her husband had done black magic on her. She was really frightened.  There was yesterday one lady who came, she was very difficult, she never came today. You were working on her.

[Sahaha Yogi speaking]  She could not come today, she was working, Mother.  She might be coming to Geneva.  Yes.

What was wrong with her?  What chakras were catching?

[Sahaja Yogi speaking]  The Agyna.  She was thinking so much.  She was left alone with two children by her husband, so she had a hard time to forgive him.

She was with two children, left by her husband?

[Sahaja Yogi speaking]  And now the financial situation is not good, so she felt depressed.

But here the government pays for them, isn’t it?

[Sahaja Yogi speaking] But no, I don’t think so. No.  You have separation and divorce.  She was thinking too much. She didn’t want to talk about it. She would talk to You, Shri Mataji, but not to us.

But it’s a very difficult situation.  You are left with children.  England is better.  In America, it is better, much better.

[Sahaja Yogi speaking]  She said she was going to come, Mother.

In America, you may have this profession, they go on divorcing men after men. The men become paupers, the women become rich.  It is a very big profession!

[Sahaja Yogi speaking]  Shri Mataji, would you allow me to show You what some of the Sahaja Yogis did?  We wanted to present to You, and we would like Your advice, to whom we should give that to in India.  Let me show You the thing now, if possible.

Yes, for a while, and then we can see everything.  [Unclear]  It is very difficult when you work on this kind of person.  [Unclear]  And there was a little boy, suffering from very bad left Nabhi, a very serious type of left Nabhi.  And the mother was a very dominating woman. And very sort of exacting type.  She has made the boy’s spleen, the speedometer, very hectic.  So that’s why one has to work out all these things first.

Little bit tired, from travelling, take it easy.  Let it be, children don’t understand.  Let them stay, they are using those things like a rhythm.  Ma is “Mother” in Marathi language! In Hindi it is “to give”.  In Sanskrit language is “da”.  And they say “ne ne”, “take”.  So they start in universal language, and then they deviate!

All right, I will lie down for a while, and then I will come down.  What is the time now?

[Sahaja Yogi speaking]  3.20, Mother.

You people have finished your lunch?

[Sahaja Yogi speaking] No, we are waiting for you, Mother.

But I must have a nice [unclear: bath].  I didn’t know!

[Sahaja Yogi speaking]  It’s all right.  We have plenty of time.

Please go ahead, I am feeling tired.  This is too much!  Now I know why!  That is why I am feeling tired, you are all hungry!  I was not feeling all right!

May God Bless You!  Have your food.

[Singing]

[Unclear]

Oh, great!  And now I’d like to lie down if it’s all right.
