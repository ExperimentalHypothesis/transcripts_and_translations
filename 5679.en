You are welcome!

Shri Mata ji: Talks to someone in Marathi.

We are sorry, we can’t have it in  Hall. We can have it in the open, you see .

All this thing, factually, happens like this.

Did you get relief here? How are you? How are you, now? Hann! Not bad!

Yogi: [Inaudible]

Shri Mata ji: Not better! Have you been to some other Guru, I think;

Have you been?

Have you been to some other people also?

Yogi: [Inaudible]

Shri Mata ji: Where have you been?

Yogi: [Inaudible]

Shri Mata ji: But did you go to see some body else also?

Yogi: [Inaudible]

Shri Mata ji: Yes! To whom did you see?

Yogi: [Inaudible]

Shri Mata ji: Then, that's why we can't work you out.

Yogi: Haan!

Shri Mata ji: That’s the reason, we can't work it out on you. we can't work it out on you. You see! If you have been to all these people, they spoil your Kundalini and this does not rise. What can we do about it? That’s the reason you are not better, every body is better. But, if you go to such people, who spoil your Kundalini, then we can not save, it's very difficult.

[Talks to someone in Marathi].

Shri Mata ji: Just you go with him, he will tell how, what to do, one minute outside.

‘Beta’, what is there to weep in it, what are we doing here? You remove your cloth and sit comfortably; Keep sitting absolutely comfortably. Nothing, you are not doing anything. What is there to weep in it? We have sent out the Doctor Sahib.

Yes! Sir! Yes, Ok, take this out only, your cloth, take out your coat. That’s all! Namaste! How are you, alright! ‘Arey’, I will vibrate and ask this child to go. And tomorrow we will work it out on him. Alright!

[Hindi- Marathi- English Mix talk]

In day time only take him out of this room;

Yogi: Where are lemons!

[Talk in Marathi]

Ok, take this, they are giving you, go, (says something in Marathi);

You go there; he will tell you.

Can you see him, this child, otherwise he will be disturbing like this? Giving so many, [ talks in Marathi]. Let him go. Good returns for the bad ... (Unclear).

Hann! Give here, ‘Bete’, take these and go. They are telling you everything, understand it; So, come tomorrow morning. But tomorrow morning we are going to Delhi. He will attend you. You, please see him. Give him vibrations. Alright! He is Doctor. Just show him, how to do it. Haan!

Take him that side, we will take other Doctor, where has he gone?

Yogi: [Inaudible]

Shri Mata ji: Alright! They are after him tirelessly. What to say, ‘Baba’, how people waste energy.

Shri Krishna has said in our Gita, “Yoga Kshemam Vahamyaham”. This means, “Yoga first.” He could say “Kshem” first but he said “Yoga” first and then “Kshem”. “Kshem” means your wellbeing, your Lakshmi Tatva [element]. But first “Yoga” should take place. Until Yoga [union] happens, you have no business with the divine. First, you should experience Yoga i.e. union with Almighty, Atma [Spirit] should awaken within you.

When the Spirit is awakened within you, then you enter into the domain of Almighty in reality. Otherwise, just like a crammer [who keeps mugging things], everything remains superficial. Until you know your inner Self, until you have recognition of Self, you do not enter the domain of Almighty. That’s why you are not authorised to get what Almighty has said.

Many people put blame on Almighty that we are so much devoted to God, doing so much worshipping, we stand upside down on our head so long, we do this, do that, we offer food [bhog], morning till evening keep chanting, but still why don’t we find Almighty?

Reality is that in order to talk to Almighty, you must establish a connection with Him. Until one attains Yoga, Kshem is not possible. ‘Kshem’ means ‘your protection from all sides’, Lakshmi Tatva [element] gets awakened within us.

Krishna just said “Vahamyaham – I will do”, But He did not explain “how”. So let me explain to you how it works out.

When Yoga takes place, Kundalini rises up from triangular bone and pierces through Brahma Randhra (hole in Fontanelle area). When the power of Kundalini pierces through Brahma Randhra, it gets Light/flame [Jyoti] in it because it receives Light/flame (Jyoti) of our Spirit and due to this light, Lakshmi Tatva in Nabhi chakra is awakened. As soon as Lakshmi Tatva is awakened, you will see that from all sides you will get prosperity.

If someone becomes very rich, whom we call wealthy, it’s not necessary that he would be prosperous too. Most of the rich people are generally unhappy. More money they have, more stupid they would be and in their homes all sort of dirty things like wine, cunningness, lies etc. is seen with them.

All the time afraid, fears that the government will

come and catch them, may confiscate, that our money may be lost, this happens, that happens.

So, those who are wealthy, are not Lakshmipatis. Because Lakshmi Tatva is not awakened within them, they have just earned money. For them money is just like mud, it does not give any comfort/happiness. Lakshmi Tatva must be understood.

Last time, I had explained how Lakshmi has been formed. She has two lotuses in her hands, which are of pink colour. With one hand, she donates and with another gives shelter. Pink colour represents “Love”. If a human does not have love in his heart, he cannot be Lakshmipati. His house should be like a lotus flower. Lotus even gives shelter to an insect called “Bhowra” [black colour insect like a wasp], because that’s very dry, it’s sharp spikes would pinch if you keep it on hand, comforts it and let’s it rest on its glory. Make it sleep, gives peace. Lakshmipati is the one whose heart is quite great. One who is very delightful to his guests and to anyone is Lakshmipati.

But you see, most of the rich people are the greatest beggars. If you visit their house, they would die of fear that my two paisa would be spent. The person, who is always worried that today 4 cents on this, 2 cents on that is getting spent, save this, where to save, from where to recover, such a person cannot be Lakshmipati.

A miserly person cannot be Lakshmipati. One who is miser is a miser, he is not Lakshmipati. A miser is poor, very poor. He has no royalty in his behaviour. One who has no royalty in his attitude, should not be called Lakshmipati. One who is royal always lives in a royal manner either in poverty or affluence. He lives like a king.

One who is worried about petty things, after every penny, about two-two coins, cannot be a Lakshmipati. Since Lakshmi Tatva is not awakened, he gets a strong catch of Nabhi Chakra. Materialism creeps in such a person, he becomes very materialistic/worldly [jad-wadi]. He picks on every small thing like this is mine, this is my son, blah blah. If all such things get in someone, he is not a Lakshmipati. “Should I steal this person’s thing, steal that person’s thing, take this or take that, everything should be for myself,” One, who thinks like this is also not a Lakshmipati.

One who is for others, “If I have a posh house, how many people will be accommodated, if I have some nice things, how many people will feel comfort. How would I welcome others, how would I be able to help others, how would I keep others in my heart?” There is no question of helping others. One thinks that these are my own [kins], “Whatever I am trying to do is, to help myself.”

Then Lakshmi Tatva is awakened in real. His face, his lifestyle has to be like a lotus, such a person should be fragrant and like one who stinks with pride. One should be very humble.

You must have seen Lotus that it is bent little bit downwards. Lotus never stands straight; it’s stem is always bent down a little bit. Likewise, the lotuses held by Lakshmiji in her hands, both Lotuses have similar tenderness. While interacting with others, he talks with very cool attitude, with joy, full of compassion, not artificial. Those lotuses are not that of plastic, but real. Such a person in reality should be like a lotus. At one hand one has to be beneficent. From his hand, donations should keep on flowing and flowing always. I have seen my father like that. He was very generous person. Always giving. If he accumulates something in ample, he would donate. He would not get enjoyment, until he donates something. If someone tells him that, “Why don’t you watch out what people are taking away?” On this he answers that, “What should I keep watch on? Who [divine] has to give out is giving away, I am just standing in between and giving? What to see, I feel embarrassed when people say that I am donating.” Such a wealthy person, who does not accumulate anything for himself but keeps giving things to others, he enjoys in giving and not in receiving, such a person is Lakshmipati. Only such a person gets it and keeps giving. One who keeps thinking of himself, “How I or my own children will be benefitted, how will I get better?”, such a person is not Lakshmipati, has no grace, he is like a beggar.

And with other hand he gives shelter. Whoever comes to his house, takes care with love, cares him absolutely like his own son. In his house, there are servants, animals and people in his shelter, but they all always know that he is their protector. If we have any trouble, he will help us. Even in night he will get up to help us. He does it silently and does not tell, doesn’t let them realize that I have done so much for them, did that; He does it absolutely secretly. God is also exactly same. That is Shri Laxmi form of divine in a female form like a mother and she stands on a lotus. Just think about it, in order to stand on a Lotus how much simplicity one has to have, absolutely light [weight] without putting any load on it.

That person must be such that he can stand on a Lotus and he does not put pressure on anyone. He must be very humble. Those who show off about their possessions that, “We have this, that, blah blah” cannot be Laxmipati. Motherhood Must be in him. Must have a Mother’s heart, then we can call him Laxmipati. All these are characteristics of a Laxmipati.

And when this element is awakened within, the first thing that comes to you is the satisfaction. There is no limit of anything otherwise, you know as they say in Economics that “No needs are satiable in general.” Today you have this thing, so tomorrow you need that thing, then something else and so on. Man keeps running like a mad, there is no end to that. Today I get this so now I need that, something else.

But one achieves contentment [with awakening of Laxmi Tatva]. Until he achieves contentment, cannot enjoy anything. Because contentment is thing of present, hope is thing of future and disappointment is thing of past. When you stand in contentment, you are fully enjoying your possessions. Otherwise, whatever one gets he says. “Oh that other person has got so much. I want that thing. then why did you get this thing?” When he gets that he again wants something else. Such a person can never enjoy his life and neither can he ascend. Day and night his eye will be only on such things. Things which are in vain, Things which are not important, things which are meaningless in life, things which have nothing to do with joy in life, he keeping chasing only such things in life.

But first Yoga must happen then Kshem [wellbeing] follows. Here many Sahaja Yogis have accompanied me, who have been with me in Sahaja Yoga and they have achieved it and progressed in Sahaja Yoga. They progressed financially too, all of them A to Z. Some of them who were penniless earlier, gained hundreds of thousands of rupees [Lacs]. We have such people too here, who, now as we will see here.

For instance, these English people, they wanted to visit India and have been thinking, “How to go”. They have money of course. They also achieved financial wellbeing, earned lot of money and enjoyed a comfortable life. But when they were about to travel, a firm offered to sponsor their travel since they had done something for them. Paramatma [Almighty] helps even in such small ways and you save so much of money that you don’t understand what to do with that money.

Earlier they used to take drugs, drink and all sorts of things. Lot of money used to get lost in such things. Now I notice that they have good homes, got all good things in their homes, they listen good music, have all good hobbies, started living a good life, their children became very good. I asked them, “How all this happened?” They answered that, “Earlier we used to waste all of money and had no sense about our whereabouts itself. We were always out of our senses and had no idea about our lifestyle and actions.”

That’s the reason all Gurus prohibited wine and other such things. This wine is such harmful thing that the moment it enters the house from one side, Shri Laxmi immediately steps out from other. It’s so simple. No sooner she notices bottle coming in the house, she leaves immediately from other side. Such person never gets blessings of Lakshmi ji. Those who drink, will never have blessings of Lakshmi ji. Of course, they may have lot of money, their sons would waste money, wife would run away, children would run away. something or other show will happen. Tell me about one single home where they drink and have happiness. They cannot be happy, as wine is always against the happiness. That’s why Gurus said “No” to wine. Specifically, why did everyone prohibited? We must think about it. After all they were not insane. Thousands time they told not to drink, “Drinking is bad! Don’t drink, don’t drink,” Wine is a thing, God never created for drinking. It was created for polishing, doing polish. But people will start drinking and offering, what to say about people’s mind? What can one do, if they start drinking anything? Man’s mind is so stupid that anything they like, start drinking it. Who told them to drink? When you drink this polish on the name of wine, all your lever, intestines get polished too. Even your arteries get stiffened with polish. Arteries become so stiff that their tissues are no longer flexible, means they cannot grow bigger or smaller, they just freeze. Arteries size just gets fixed, so even blood cannot flow. Blood gets stuck in them unless there is pressure on it. If there is no flexibility in arteries and it becomes like a stiff pipe, what would happen?

Such coatings of polish keep on accumulating beyond limits and man himself becomes like a polish. Such person is very artificial. Such drunker will show off superficially lot of goodness in him. He looks gentleman, he is generous, this, that. All superficial. One who can keep his wife and children starved, one who can show high-handedness with wife and children, whatever fake gentle behaviour may such a person exhibit, his love [voice not clear].

That’s why liqueur has been prohibited. It has been prohibited so much, why did they do so? Now Muslims have been prohibited from drinking, but they drink it most. Why did they prohibit, must think? Person like Muhammad Sahib, why did he prohibit.

Shri Nanak prohibited it. In London, no one drinks more than Sikhs. They have even defeated English people there in this. Isn’t it true? In which religion, drinking has been appreciated? None of the religions would have said so. But in every religion, people drink so much. And our [Adi] Gurus are being insulted.

Our whole Nabhi Chakra and surrounding it, our ten Dharmas which are formed by (Adi) Gurus, these ten Dharmas are in our Nabhi. That’s why our Gurus have prohibited that in order to establish our Dharmas.

First thing is that you should not be addicted to liqueur or any such thing and become its slave. If you want to be slave, why do you talk about liberation? People think, this slavery is the freedom. If someone tells them that, “Son, don’t drink liqueur”, they think that they are being restricted and their freedom is being snatched. (Mother laughs.) Human beings are so mad.

If refrained to do something, ‘Bete’ it’s done so that you don’t become slave of these things. Whenever elderly people suggest something, then one must ponder over it, instead of cramming it morning till evening. We must ponder over it that, “Why [such person] has told so?” There must be some good reason behind it. Why so learned or respected people had to say such a thing? Why they told no to this thing in particular? Must thing about it, ponder over it.

Any person if thinks over it a little, can understand that such filthy things we have adopted, due to which, Laxmi principle (Tatva) has vanished [from our society]. Laxmi principle has vanished completely from India. Here Laxmi principle is not existing at all and awakening it is also very difficult. Because Laxmi principle is the main step of divine seeking. Nabhi is the abode of Shri Vishnu and the abode of Shri Vishnu is, Vishnu, whom we know, Shri Laxmi is power of Shri Vishnu. It’s where from journey of seeking begins.

When we are at amoeba stage, we seek food. When we evolve to bigger animals, then we seek more food, water, companionship. After that we became humans, so now we seek power, authority and money. Many people are all the time after the food. Morning till evening what to eat, what not to eat, do this, do that, remain engrossed in all these things, spoiling [themselves]. Those who have sickness of overeating, how they too Laxmipati, they are beggars. They are never contented.

Once one of our daughter in law in relation visited us and started saying, “In our paternal place we had all this, that.” So I said, “A little of that should reflect in you as you don’t have even little contentment. You want to eat this thing, that thing, want to roam around all over. Did your father nurture any satisfaction at all in you or not? If your father was really such a Laxmipati, there would be at least some contentment in you.”

If you get something fine, else forget about it. When a man reaches such a stage. When he loses his authority, he learns that he did not find happiness in power, money, anything that he had been seeking. Then seeking for the joy begins and that too from Nabhi Chakra.

Just due to this seeking, we evolved from amoeba stage to Humans. And due to same seeking though which we seek divine, we evolve from human stage to Super Human [Ati Manav]. We know Self, we know Spirit [Atma]. That’s the reason, Laxmi principle is very important.

And Lakshmi ‘Tatva’ is situated surrounded by the Dharma. There are ten Dharmas in human beings. Now since you have become modern, so go and trash all Dharmas. Now, you have become modern, great! But these ten Dharmas are anyways inside you; It’s proven these are very much there.

If man does not have these ten Dharmas [virtues], he would become devil. Just as gold has its own dharma that it does not get deteriorated, similarly these ten dharmas in you let you maintain the human principles. If you disregard these ten Dharmas, there are sub-Dharmas too but basically you have to maintain these ten Dharmas [virtues]. If you disregard these ten Dharmas, you will never be uplifted, you cannot be realized.

First unless you establish your Dharmas, you cannot become dharmateet [go beyond Dharmas], cannot rise above Dharma. First these Dharmas have to be established.

That’s why all these Adi Gurus have worked so hard, they worked too hard. And we are destroying their hard work. We are completely destroying them.

Our first primary duty is to establish in these ten Dharmas. But nowadays these gurus have nothing to do with your Dharmas. [They would say,] “Okay so you drink? No problem. Get us a bottle too. Okay you keep many women? Okay, no problem you keep tens of women. Just, one, send to us too” or “Send your wife and children to us. Whatever money you have in your pocket, give it to us. We have no concern with you. You do business as you wish to do. Whatever money you have in your purse, just deposit here. Then you do as you wish to.”

Just today she was narrating one incidence, who has accompanied me here. She has a cousin sister, who happens to be a princess too. And her husband is a drunker, very bad man. He was disciple of a guru. She went and told his Guru that husband beats and tortures her, has a keep, “Please tell him something [to mend his ways]. He keeps women, though he is a prince but what to do about him? So spoiled, he is getting.” So he started saying, “Leave it, what’s to you?” He kept on sucking money from him, as Guru only had business only with his money. Is this a kind of guru? Those who suck money from you, how can they be your gurus? Those who survive on your money, they are actually parasites, worse than your servants. At least your servants do some work for you. But such evil people who live on your money must be put in ‘Rakshas’s yoni’.  And I say, “Those who visit such devils are great fools”. Why don't they see that you can buy God? You can buy a guru, if someone is a guru, will he ever sell himself? He has its own pride; you can't buy him. Whoever wants, you can win him over only with your love. Your devotion, your affection, your ‘Bhakti’ and with nothing else you can entice him. He has his own honour, his own prestige. He has his own Royalship; how does he care, you may be wealthy- be at your home. What’s to him, he can even eat on a leafy-plate, can even sleep on ground.

If he wishes so, can live in a palace too. He lives the way he wants to. He has no business with you except your love, obeisance and your seeking. If you are true seeker, he will put you on his head.

You must look for a Guru, who talks about God, who identifies you with your Spirit. Guru is only one who identifies you with God [Maalik]. You make such one a Guru. Making whomsoever a Guru, these are not even agurus, they are devils [rakshasa], devils... They 

give you rings. One who shows you rings, while talking about God, he puts your attention on rings. You don’t see it.

There is one who is teaching nude dancing, teaching immorality [adharma]. Which religion it is all scripted? Another thing we must know about modern gurus, that they have crafted their own ideas. that do not match with earlier Gurus; Their way of living, their teachings, their behaviour, their sayings; nothing is in match with them.

Every religion holds a history, which you can say, that in all religions, see same thing, absolutely same is being preached. You read your Shankracharya, you would know Sahaja Yoga; Study Kabir you would know Sahaja Yoga, Read Nanak you will know, read Mohammad you will know, Christ you read will understand. Right from Confucius and Socrates you see everyone, Sahaja Yoga only has been taught.

And all these who make you stand upside down on head, this that, make you dance to their tune to destroy you, how can you recognise them as Gurus? Guru has only one identification. One who connects you with God [Maalik] is the Guru and rest are not Gurus. If you are standing on Truth, you have to see only this thing. But man has become so superficial that he looks at the circus instead, how much fuss man is carrying, roaming with how many pots on his head, what hair style he is moving with, as if horns on his head. 

Guru has only one identification. Other than God, any other thing, he does not know. He is engrossed in that only. Recognise only such a person a Guru who is on a higher plane than you. But ones you purchase in market, whom you pay, who make fool out of you, hypnotise you. You are attached with them, completely associated with them. What to say about such people?

And in this Kali Yuga, in this extreme Kali Yuga, there are many such weird cartoons, I tell you, whom to describe, about whom to say? Such gurus have never been, nor will they be, I think, the way the cartoons are nowadays, one over the other. But it is so sticky, that thing,

Recently in Dehradun [a place in UP state], a lady came [to program]. Her Kundalini was completely frozen like this. So, I asked her which guru she was visiting? She told about some guru she used to visit. I asked her that, “Did you learn about that guru from newspapers or not? He had done something wrong with an eighteen-year-old girl, that girl and 25 more girls published this news in Blitz and other newspapers. It was published ten years ago.” She started saying, “Yes I read about this but all that is lie.” I asked her, “If that’s lie then what did you get from him?”

On this she felt very bad and started saying, “Mataji I am a married woman, I am a good person.” Then I told her, “Then why do you even visit such person’s doorstep?”

But it’s not that woman is a mischievous or a bad character person, but she is under influence of hypnosis. She is hypnotised.

They have no freedom. Guru will sit on the seventh floor. You go there and offer seva. So big boxes are kept there, you put donations. In them. ‘Seva’ means ‘you give donations’. And people go there with their pockets full to donate. You go and see anywhere, so big trunks are kept.

Even when people touch my feet, someone offers one rupee, sometimes five rupees. I feel like laughing. I mean they got so conditioned, you visit Shri Hanumana temple, there also offer one rupee and a quarter. And for this reason, everywhere, I mean in Mosques, Temples everywhere they have messed up. They have not spared any holy place. For this very reason, our young sons, those young people wonder, “This is God or some drama?” They have some wisdom; their minds are still intact. They are developing disbelief. You will be surprised; it has spread in all religions.

A gentleman came from Algeria. He was a young very brilliant engineer. He was also in this protest, “These Muslims and such fanatics,

(यह सैने की सी जमीन में है और

इस तरह से यह लोग बुस्ता करते हैं- UNCLEAR)

these Mullah’s clergies eat up all money and make living out of public’s money and they think of themselves as very great people. Everyone bows before them. Then we saw Pope also, he is another cartoon. “saw Pope also, he is another cartoon.” So, he came to me with all these disbeliefs. He said all this is falsehood, it’s absolutely meaningless. All false. When he came to me, I said it’s not like that, “If Truth exists then only falsehood will also manifest. When Truth exists, on its very basis people make false things.” Right? Truth exists, Absolute exists. Then I told him, “Good now check out Sahaja Yoga. This Sahaja Yoga stands right in

between fanaticism and disbeliefs where God himself is with you. You get to realization, experience it. You must fix up yourself then.

Unless you establish in Sahaja Yoga, you cannot experience it fully. Those who established themselves, found it. Those who did seek, found it. If you do not seek, the Truth is not going to come to your feet, ‘Bhaiya’ seek me. It has its own prestige. One 

must seek it, in seeking Truth one is rewarded with bliss, truth and bliss both are one. When both are same, like moon has its moonlight, or sun has its sunlight. Similarly, you find the Truth and Joy simultaneously. When You get to the Truth, you get immersed in Joy; Get engrossed in Joy.

But this is not about lecturing that I keep giving lectures morning till evening. Lectures give me throat soars. Now, it’s about finding it, achieve something, get to know your Spirit.

I have seen many such brave hearts who say, “We did not feel anything, Mataji.” As if they are very great. It must happen. If nothing happens, it means there is something wrong with you. There is some ailment, you must be sick, may be mentally you aren’t alright, might be you bowed before some false guru. If you have bowed your forehead, that has been made by God in all dignity, before a false person. Then everything gets finished.

You should not believe me too, blindly. That’s wrong. We want you to find it and if you unbelieve even after that, then Then there is no greater full than you and if you don’t settle even after that then what can be said for you? Once you find it, you must establish in it and after settling you see that whatever all powers, you have flow through your hands like this, that you can share this bliss with others too. Can give to others too. And how it happens, how it works out, you will slowly, as you progress in it, you understand yourself.

Many amongst these people [Sahaja Yogis] there are many who came to me six months ago, only six months ago. Now this Dr. Benerjee came six months ago, who is a prominent doctor in London and runs his practice in Germany too. Since he got it, he is after this thing. Since then, he has cured cancers and lot many other diseases. Now he says that after finding it, everything else looks irrelevant to us. Because when you get to the basic principle and start working on it, get hold of it, then other things are no more difficult to work upon.

Like this, you all have right to get it. That’s why it’s called Sahaja. ‘Sah’ means ‘with[in] you’, ‘ja’ means ‘born’. You also have right to get it and all other persons too have rights on it and you must achieve it. Like one candle can light up another, in same way one realized soul can give realization to others but he too must be a realized soul. If one candle is not light up, what can it do to another? When second candle is enlightened, it lights up third one too. That’s how this happening takes place and one gets the light within.

Now getting light Does not mean, you see the light. This is also very weird thing that people want to see the light. When it’s about seeing something, you are not there. For example, understand if you are outside, you can see a building but when you have entered the building, what will you see? Nothing at all! Then only you are there. Wherever one sees something, must think that you are still outside. Those who see the light, it’s like getting short circuited, like the light of spark, so, whoever see the light, tell me, Agnya chakra has problem. It needs to be fixed.

Your all chakras, your Kundalini cures by itself. She is your mother, everyone’s individual mother. One that you call as “Surati”. She is same “Surati” and she ascents by itself, and 

cures you and takes you up there. If you have any faults, it can be understood too, she informs about that defect, that also can be corrected. But one must be in receptive mood that, “Let we receive it and indulge in it.”

Now one thing that was raised yesterday, is striking in mind today again that it is said that Kundalini Awakening is very difficult, very tough. How is it felt? People often dance, few dance like monkey and some do something.

Nothing. I have raised Kundalini of thousands and they got realization. It never happens like that. God has given this thing for your benevolence; she is your mother meant for rebirth. She will never cause any pain to you. Instead, she gives you so much comfort. Ailments like cancer are cured by Kundalini awakening. All your diseases can be cured.

Such a great loving energy which bestows all blessings, is sitting inside you. Having such disbeliefs that we will become monkey or a frog! This thing which evolves you into a super human, would it really turn you into a frog? You must understand this thing!

This is difficult for those who are fools, know nothing about it, who is not authorized for it. For one, who is authorized and knows everything about its functioning, it’s very simple task to do. Quite possible that we have authority on it and we know all its functions and details, that’s why it rises so easily. Anyway, with your own eyes you can see its rising. You can see its awakening and its ascent too. And we have filmed this as well. But those who are very doubtful, Sahaja Yoga develops with bit difficulty in such people. One must achieve it.

Nowadays such a time has come, the age we are living in. In this Kali Yuga that we are living in. Actually, I would say that from spiritual perspective, we are miser. No sensitivity! We don’t have sensitivity at all. If spirituality, had we had we understood and if we knew the identification of Spirit, then we would have never run behind false gurus. But our ability to recognize Truth has become very lowered, very subdued. We cannot recognize where the truth is?

Nowadays such a time has come, in this Kali Yuga that we are living in. I would say actually that we are very weak from spiritual perspective. No sensitivity! We don’t have sensitivity at all. If we understood spirituality, if we knew how to recognize the Spirit, we would have never run behind false gurus. But our ability to recognize Truth has become very lowered, very subdued. We cannot recognize where is the truth. Reason behind that is that we have become so artificial, so artificial. If you become artificial, your ability to recognize truth will be lowered.

But as I see in villages even nowadays people recognize it immediately. They immediately know who is real and who is fake. They have this acumen to know, they can sense that this person is fake and this person is real.

But, as you know urban people become so artificial, they live artificially. They have no sense of recognition. That is why all these thieves are focussed on cities. They all go to cities, don’t work in villages at all. Because people in cities have money in their pocket and they are concerned with money in your pocket. Why would they work in villages?

But our Sahaja Yoga works out in villages only. Actually, I visit cities just like that but real work is done in villages. Those villagers who are simple and connected with God, they get it very easily. They don’t take even a second. They don’t take even a second! But in cities due to the environment and their life style, people change themselves, they go down in their virtues [dharmas] so much.

Now about drinking they say, “What’s wrong in that, everyone must drink for business.”

As if business is the God. “One must drink, without that, how business would run.” Or otherwise, you say,” In God and [Dharma], you have no faith at all”. And if you believe even a little bit, then whatever is non virtuous That’s not to be done. There is no need for any one drink. This too is a misconception. That for business one has to drink. One who wants to deceive himself, no one can save such a person.

You know my husband. He has been in government job. He ran a big shipping corporation and after that Even today he has reached high positions. I told him only one thing drinking is beyond me and whole life he even did not touch it, not even a drop. And by grace of almighty, he has been very successful. Everyone honours him, respects him.

Till date, has there been even a single statue of a drunker for this was a great drunker? Tell me about any one person, in any country. In England people drink so much. I never saw any such person’s statue there being worshipped for how much he used to drink. Has any drunker got any recognition in this whole world anywhere? Then how can your business prosper with its help? If you lose your reputation, how your business will grow? Business is rewarded for your repute, not by cheating. Should be like if a man stands anywhere, people recognize him and say such a man is there. Why are you mixing yourself in these issues of society, these illusions? You take care of your own personality. God resides within you.

It’s foolish to talk on these lines and saying itself is foolish. But you don’t know how much have you broken yourself within, how much pushed yourself into slavery. After getting away with such things, what is that I can grant you? You only tell me. Not at the least, you must take a vow that, whatever we are, we have self-respect.

God Almighty has evolved us from amoeba to human. One tiny amoeba, developing it into human being, how difficult it is? After letting you pass through thousands of yonis, God Almighty has created such beautiful humans. Then he granted you the freedom to make the choice of goodness or perversion. You can embrace anything you like. Do you want to embrace perversion? Go get perverted. If You want to embrace goodness, be good. 

Now you one must think that the God who created us, with so much effort, must have built-in within us some arrangement to know him, understand him. Know self and understand the purpose of self and why we are born in this world, what is our fulfilment?

Humans never tried to know why we are born in this world? Why don’t scientists think that why amoeba was evolved into human? What’s so greatness within us for which God created us with so much effort and then granted complete freedom. Only at this point, even God surrenders before you since you are free. God cannot take away your freedom.

If you have to be settled in the Kingdom of God, to be adorned like a king, then how can you be in bondage? Should hypnosis be used on you? You are completely free. If you like, embrace God in your life or if you wish, go for Satan. God has opened both options for you completely. And everyone has worked so hard.

Let me tell you all Gurus have faced so many troubles for you. All incarnations, Gurus have put in so much of efforts. They tolerated all those pains in order to establish you, people.

But this Kali Yuga came like a We have forgotten all our spiritual insensibility, so surprising, that we cannot recognize anyone by his face whether he is a real one or fake.

If a person is Godly, it becomes evident from his face. We lost this ability to recognize [truth], that sensitivity within us completely vanished. When Rama came in this world, all knew that he is an incarnation. When Krishna came, all recognized him as an incarnation. But now such Time has come that none recognizes anyone. In Christ Time also the same thing happened. But few people did recognise; But today time has come that people recognize bhoots and rakshasas as an incarnation. But now we are at such times that nobody can recognize anyone. The same thing happened with Christ too. 

One must pull out from these illusions and one must ask for only one thing that, “O Lord, please be awakened within us. So that we can know ourselves.” Without recognition of Spirit, we cannot know God, can’t know, can’t know. Everything else is futile. All this is a circus. All these, as we call them are external displays. No point in satisfying ourselves with these external shows. You are deceiving yourself only.

Who can deceive God? He knows you very well. You are causing losses to yourself only. You must achieve it since it’s your own energy, your own property. The source is right within you. Everything is filled inside you only, you must get it and then must establish yourself in this.

When I come in Sahaja Yoga, many people come, but all here say, “Mother! They don’t make progress”. Now, where I have seen such hopeless people but they have reached great heights. And those, we thought great about some people, they are sticking where they were. They come back with same issues, same headaches, same problems, same troubles. This is happening, that’s happening; Still their level has risen only this much.

In Sahaja yoga, until you give out, you cannot progress. You will have to give out. As you keep giving to others, you would keep progressing further. If we build a big boat, say a ship and we don’t put it in waters, it carries no meaning of this? Just like that, if a man finds God and sits at home, what’s the advantage of lighting such a ‘Deep’ that light it and you place it under a table? The candle is light up so that others may get the light. With this you can see inside you as well others too. You can see; You can see your own Chakras and other’s Chakras too.

You can see your own joy and see other’s grief too. And you can know how to give it out to others, where is it getting obstructed, how should we make it.

For today’s this is enough. Now let’s meditate and see how many get their realization. You all sit comfortably. Please get the chairs for those who can’t sit down on the floor. Because those who can’t sit down, should not push themselves. Rajesh you sit on the chair. Those who are tall, find it difficult to sit down on floor.
