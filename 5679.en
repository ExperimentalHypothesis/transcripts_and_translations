[4:54] Shri
Krishna has said in our Gita “Yoga
Kshemam Vahamyaham”.
This means Yoga first. He could say “Kshem” first but he
said “Yoga” first and then “Kshem”. “Kshem”
means your wellbeing, your Lakshmi Tatva (element). But first
“Yoga” should take place. Until Yoga (union) happens, the
divine has no business with you. First, you should experience Yoga
i.e. union with almighty, Atma (spirit) should awaken with you. When
the spirit is awakened within you, then you enter into the domain of
almighty in reality. Otherwise, just like a crammer (who keeps
mugging things), everything remains superficial. Until you know your
inner self, until you have recognition of self, you do not enter the
domain of almighty. That's why you are not authorised to get what
Almighty has said. Many people put blame on almighty that we are so
much devoted to God, doing so much worshipping, we stand upside down
on our head so long, we do this, do that, we offer food (bhog),
morning till evening keep chanting, but still why don’t we find
almighty. Reality is that in order to talk to almighty, you must
establish a connection with him. Until one attains “Yoga”,
“Kshem” is not possible. “Kshem” means your
protection from all sides, Lakshmi Tatva (element) gets awakened
within us. Krishna just said “Vahamyaham - I will Do”, But
he did not explain “how”, so let me explain to you how it works
out. When Yoga takes place, Kundalini rises up from triangular bone
and pierces through Brahma Randhra (hole in Fontanelle area). When
the power of Kundalini pierces through Brahma Randhra, it gets
Light/flame (Jyoti) in it because it receives Light/flame (Jyoti) of
our spirit and due to this light, Lakshmi Tatva in Nabhi chakra is
awakened. As soon as Lakshmi Tatva is awakened, you will see that
from all sides you will get prosperity. If someone becomes very rich,
whom we call wealthy, it’s not necessary that he would be
prosperous too. Most of the rich people are generally unhappy. More
money they have, more stupid they would be. Besides, all sort of
dirty things enters their homes like Wine, cunningness, lies etc. all
sort of such things reside within them. All the time they have fears
that the government will come and catch them, they will lose money,
this happens, that happens. So, those who are wealthy, are not
Lakshmipatis. Because Lakshmi Tatva is not awakened within them, they
have just earned money. For them money is just like mud, it does not
give any comfort/happiness. We must understand Lakshmi Tatva. Last
time, I had explained how Lakshmi has been formed. She has two
lotuses in her hands, which are of pink colour. With one hand, she
donates and with another gives shelter. Pink colour represents
“Love”. If a human does not have love in his heart, he cannot be
Lakshmipati. His house should be like a Lotus flower. Lotus even
gives shelter to an insect called “Bhowra” (black colour insect
like a wasp), which is very dry and has sharp spikes on its body
which would pinch if you keep it on hand, comforts it and makes it
sleep with its glory. Lakshmipati is the one who has a very big
heart. One who is very delightful to his guests and to anyone is
Lakshmipati. But you see, most of the rich people are the greatest
beggars. If you visit their house, they would die of fear of spending
some money. One who is always worried about his money that I am
losing 4 cents on this, 2 cents on that, save this, how to save
something there, such a person cannot be Lakshmipati. A miserly
person cannot be Lakshmipati. One who is miser is a miser, he is not
Lakshmipati. A miser is poor, very poor. He has no royalty in his
behaviour. One who has no royalty in his attitude, should not be
called Lakshmipati. One who is Royal always lives in a royal manner
either in poverty or affluence. He lives like a king. One who is
worried about petty things, every penny, this thing, that thing,
cannot be a Lakshmipati. Since Lakshmi Tatva is not awakened, he gets
a strong catch of Nabhi Chakra. Materialism creeps in such a person,
he becomes very materialistic/worldly (Jad-wadi). He picks on every
small thing like this is mine, this is my son, blah blah. If all such
things get in someone, he is not a Lakshmipati. Should I steal this
person’s thing, steal that person’s thing, take this or take
that, everything should be for myself. If someone thinks like this,
he is also not a Lakshmipati. 

One who thinks about others, if I have a posh house, how many people will be accommodated, if I have some nice things, how many people will feel comfort. How would I welcome others, how would I be able to help others, how would I keep others in my heart? There is no question of helping others. One thinks that these are my own (kins). Whatever I am trying to do is, to help myself. Then Lakshmi Tatva (element or principle) is awakened in real. His face, his lifestyle has to be like a lotus, such a person should be fragrant and like one who stinks with pride. One should be very humble. You must have seen Lotus that it is bent little bit downwards. Lotus never stands straight, it's always bent down a little bit. Likewise, at least the two lotuses held by Lakshmiji in her hands, have similar tenderness. While interacting with others, he talks with a very cool attitude, with joy, in a very affectionate way. They are not artificial, those lotuses are not made of plastic, but they are real. Such a person should be like a lotus in real. At one hand one has to be beneficent. From his hand, donations should keep on flowing and flowing always. I have seen my father like that. He was a very generous person. If he accumulates something in ample, he would donate. He would not get enjoyment until he donates something. If someone tells him that why don't you watch out what people are taking away? On this, he answers that what should I keep watch on? Who (divine) has to give out is giving away, I am just standing in between. What to see, I feel embarrassed when people say that I am donating. One who is generous like this, the one who does not accumulate anything for himself but keeps giving things to others, he enjoys in giving and not in receiving, such a person is Lakshmipati. Only such a person gets it. One who keeps thinking of himself, how I or my own children will be benefitted, how will I get better? Such a person is not Lakshmipati, has no grace, he is like a beggar. And with another hand he gives shelter. Whoever comes to his house, takes care with love, care him like his own son. In his house, there are servants, animals and people in his shelter and they all know that he is there to take care of us. If we have any trouble, he will help us. He would get up in the middle of the night too to help. He does it secretly and does not tell others or make them realize that I have done so much for them. He does it absolutely secretly. Paramatma (God Almighty) is also exactly the same. That is Shree Laxmi form of the divine in a female form like a mother and she stands on a lotus. Just think about it, in order to stand on a Lotus how much simplicity one has to have, absolutely light [weight] without putting any load on it. That person must be such that he can stand on a Lotus and he does not put pressure on anyone. He must be very humble. Those who show off about their possessions that we have this, that, blah blah can not be Laxmipati. They must have motherhood, heart like a mother, then we can call them Laxmipati. All these are characteristics of a Laxmipati. And when this element is awakened within, the first this that comes to you is the satisfaction. There is no limit of anything otherwise, you know as they say in Economics that “No Needs are satiable in general”. Today you have this thing, so tomorrow you need that thing, then something else and so on. The man keeps running like a mad, there is no end to that. Today I get this so now I need that, something else. But one achieves contentment [with the awakening of Laxmi Tatva]. One can not enjoy anything until he achieves contentment. Because contentment is a thing of Present, Hope is a thing of future and disappointment is thing of past. When you stand in contentment, you are fully enjoying your possessions. Otherwise, whatever one gets he says. Oh, that other person has got so much. I want that thing. then why did you get this thing? When he gets that he again want something else. Such a person can never enjoy his life and neither can he ascend. Day and night his eye will be only on such things. Things which are in vain, Things which are not important, things which are meaningless in life, things which have nothing to do with joy in life, he kept chasing only such things in life.

But first Yoga
must happen then “Kshem” [wellbeing] follows. Here many
Sahaja Yogis have accompanied me, who have been with me in Sahaja
yoga and they have achieved it and progressed in Sahaja Yoga. They
progressed financially too, all of them A to Z. Some of them who were
penniless earlier gained hundreds of thousands of rupees (Lacs). We
have such people too here, for instance, this foreigner couple, they
wanted to visit India and have been thinking about this. They have
money of course. They also achieved financial well being, earned a
lot of money and enjoyed a comfortable life. But when they were about
to travel, a firm offered to sponsor their travel since they had done
something for them. Paramatma [Almighty] helps even in such small
ways and you save so much of money that you don’t understand what
to do with that money. 

Earlier they used to take drugs, drink and all sorts of things. A lot of money used to get lost in such things. Now I notice that they have good homes, got all good things in their homes, they listen to good music, developed all good hobbies, started living a good life, their children became very good. I asked them, how all this happened? They answered that earlier we used to waste all of the money and had no sense about our whereabouts itself. We were always out of our senses and had no idea about our lifestyle and actions. That's the reason all Gurus prohibited wine and other such things. This wine is such a harmful thing that the moment it enters the house from one side, Shree Laxmi immediately steps out from others. It's a simple account. The moment she notices your bottle of wine entering the house, she leaves immediately from the other side. Such a person never gets blessings of Lakshmi Ji. Those who drink will never have blessings of Lakshmi Ji. Of course, they would have a lot of money, their sons would waste all their money, the wife would run away, something or other will go wrong, children will run away, some or other issues will happen. Tell me about one single home where they drink and have happiness. They can not be Happy, as wine is always against happiness. That's why Gurus said "No" to Wine especially, why they prohibited? We must think about it. After all, they were not insane. Thousands time they told not to drink, Don’t drink. Wine is a thing, God had never created for drinking. It was created for polishing, doing polish. Tomorrow they will start drinking Phenyl, what to say about people’s mind? What can one do, if they start drinking anything? Man's mind is so wicked that anything they like, start drinking it. Who told them to drink? When you drink this polish on the name of the wine, all your Lever, Intestines get polished too. Even your Arteries get stiffened with polish. Arteries become so stiff that their tissues are no longer flexible, means they can not grow bigger or smaller, they just freeze. Arteries size just gets fixed, so even blood can not flow. If there is no flexibility in Arteries and it becomes like a stiff pipe then what would happen? Such coatings of polish keep on accumulating and the man himself becomes a polish.
