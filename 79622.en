There's lot of space. Ask, these girls others. Please, come forward. There's lot of space. You all can come here.

I am very happy to see so many of you are here and that Sahaja Yoga is growing so fast, it’s something very, very satisfying.
Welcome.

Also in Hong Kong and Taipei. I was so very happy to meet people of different communities, following different religions, coming to Sahaja Yoga and unite together in a big way. It was really so satisfying. What we need now is unity and also peace. If our children have to grow properly, first thing you should have is peace.

But there is so much of violence, so much of distraction for children. And if you see the world around, you'd be shocked how things are happening. Especially with this American democracy, I don't know what they are doing. The children are killing the parents, the parents are killing the children, all kinds of things. Not only violence but immoral, extremely immoral.

Now we have to understand that we must have self-respect and we are Sahaja Yogis. That's why we have our own culture in Sahaja Yoga, culture of purity and innocence and love. And I am so very happy that you are here now in Sahaja Yoga. I've been coming here so many times, so many years. But I'm very happy to see all of you here.

First of all, it's important, we should see what we have to achieve. Very important. You should have the full Self-knowledge. And after that, we can look after people, we can give them Realization. We are all very capable, all over the world, I have seen. In some places, somehow, it works slowly, and in some places it works very fast. Like in Russia, imagine, just like fire!
Posturing there, in one place in Togliatti, we have 21,000 Sahaja Yogis, in one place. And here I've been coming since long, to Kuala Lumpur, I don't know how many years. And what we see is, slowly people are [coming]. I can't say why, but it's very difficult to understand why not, do Sahaja Yoga.

Also, they come but they would not meditate, they would not come to collective. It's very sad [unsure], as if something is missing. For Russians, it's so easy, I mean, they just got surrendered to it, absolutely. They're so great. I mean, [Shri Mataji is laughing] there's a joke. They had called us for a Diwali Puja. So many Americans also came, all those Sahaja Yogis were there. So she - the joke is like this that, one of the Russians asked, you see, from Togliatti, to an American, "How many Sahaja Yogis you are in America?" So he said, "We are 56". "Oh my God, there are 56,000. We are 21, only 21,000 in Togliatti". Can you imagine? [Shri Mataji is laughing]

But once you settle down in Sahaja Yoga properly, then others will see you, and you will be very much impressed by you. Because you'll have that peace, you'll have that joy. Also you will have, we can say, that personality, that people will be surprised, "Look at them, how are they? How can they be like this?" And this is what we have to work out.

It's not difficult, I can tell you, but collectivity is very important. If you are not collective, it doesn't work out. We have to understand that collectivity is a very important part of Sahaja Yoga. I'm sure it will come up and you will come up also very well.

I wanted you all to come to Ganapatipule. Also, they have reduced the price and all that for Ganapatipule very much. Because if you do the whole Tour, then it's difficult, because quite a lot has to be paid, you see. But otherwise, only if you are coming to Ganapatipule, it’s much cheaper. Everybody can afford it, it's not so much.

Because if you are coming all the way, then we have to pay for the buses, for the trains, you know, various places. This time specially, they went to jungles and they had to go on taxis because buses were not available. So it turns out to be very expensive, that part. But Ganapatipule is all right, about, I think it is ten days you have to take leave. Whatever suits you, please try to come, because then the collectivity is much more.
Some people went to Calcutta. Did anybody go to Calcutta for My birthday? No. And they were telling Me that, "We just got lost. We didn't know where we were. Such an enjoyment, such happiness! We didn't know where we were. We were just lost in the joy of meeting everyone from all over the world". They have made very good arrangements also, very good people [unclear]. And they did very well. I must say, even the Germans were surprised the way they organized everything, every bit of it.
