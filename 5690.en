[Hindi to English translation]

One has to observe everything in the form of equality and witness. He said that here everybody is against me and everybody wants me to lose my job. Now a job is also a thing for a human being; it is a state of their well-being. After that, he started saying that at 5 in the evening, he was informed that he had been reinstated. Not only that, but he was also confirmed in his position. He was quite surprised and said he had no idea how everyone suddenly started speaking in his favor, and it was done. When he asked what time it happened, they said it was decided at 2:15 PM. The gentleman who was with him also checked the time and was surprised, wondering how everyone’s mindset had changed all of a sudden, how they were all speaking in the same way.

Such things do happen, and many experiences can arise. After realization [Self-Realization], people have had so many experiences that if they were to be compiled, countless books could be written on them, and many articles would have to be penned.

Anyway, there is a book about Me written by a gentleman from Switzerland who, although a native French speaker, made an effort to write in English. That book has been completed, and we intend to publish it on the 27th, and we would like all of you to be present there and see the book. In it, he has written, many such experiences, and historically, he has traced how Sahaja Yoga has reached its current state and why people are experiencing Amass Realization.

It is a very beautiful book, and a lot of hard work has gone into it. I have also looked through it quite a bit, though I hardly get any time to read much. But he has put in a lot of effort, and he is a very learned man—extremely learned. He has written this book covering everything, from Socrates to all the Upanishads and other scriptures. It is an exceptionally beautiful book. It also talks about Gandhiji—what his role was in the advent of Sahaja Yoga, and so on. The book is very well written. And whatever expenses have been incurred in printing this book, I have said that only the actual cost should be charged, nothing more. Although people often lecture Me, saying, 'Mother, if you do this, no one will buy the book, thinking’, "How can such a cheap book be so beautiful, so big," and so on. But I don’t conform to such teachings because I am excessively independent in this matter. Such experiences are numerous, but if you are a devotee of truth and are seeking the truth, you should know that the achievement gained from it is the ultimate truth.

"Absolute Truth" means the complete, the ultimate—where there is no relativity left because you become that truth itself. For you, the truth right now is that this canopy is set up, people are sitting here, and whatever science and other things exist—this is all truth for you. But the ultimate truth is that the power of the Divine prevails over the entire universe; it is transmitted everywhere, functioning even at the atomic and subatomic levels. It is so dynamic, so subtle, and its work is so extraordinary—it thinks, understands, and loves. Not only that, but it also carries out all the functions of the entire universe.

Attaining such a supreme power is the true reality, and you can only attain it when you become connected to it. It is a simple task—to connect you with that supreme power.

Ever since I was born, I knew all of this—I was aware of everything. But My father, who was himself a great saint, a highly realized man, told Me that until I discover a collective system, a system for the common people, any discussion on this subject will become just another Bible or another Gita. Otherwise, things will keep getting built upon it, and people will keep clinging to words without truly understanding them. Words will remain mere words. And if only one or two individuals attain realization, it won’t make much difference because, at that time, I could see no one else except those few who had attained it.

This is why they said that people cannot understand certain things, and these matters do not come within the grasp of ordinary intellect. Therefore, if they are enlightened, then these things will become clear to everyone. And now, the time for this has come. This is why You[Shri Mataji] have been born into this world, and this is your purpose. He had dreams about Me. My mother also had many dreams, and accordingly, until the very end, she kept asking Me whether I had found that thing or not. Even before her death, My mother kept asking, "Now that I am going to meet your father, tell me whether you have found that thing or not." When I told her, "Yes, I have found it, and I have discovered it."

So what I did was this: I went into deep contemplation Myself and, through My life, I had such connections with people that I had a deep bond with the masses—because My father was also an old Congressman, and I too had been with Gandhiji. I had the opportunity to observe everyone closely there.

So through contemplation, with a subtle mind, I would observe the inner state of each person—their inner expressions, what questions lay within them, what problems were present, and what had made a person the way they were. In other words, what were their permutations and combinations?

I entered into the inner worlds of thousands of people and saw what their questions were, what issues they carried, what kinds of flaws might exist in them, what disturbances were present, and why. Because when a realized soul comes into the world, they have no questions—they simply remain in their bliss.

But others, who are still below that state, so Now, how to raise them upward becomes the question for them. If someone happens to have a nature that resonates with theirs[Realised Soul’s], then the process becomes easier. But because there are so many permutations and combinations in human beings, very rarely would someone be found who is close to their nature—who, with just a little effort, could be set right.

That’s why people would take a few such individuals and live in the forests with them, working hard to uplift them.

Because without giving, without offering something, there is no true joy in it. But that thing—the truth or realization—also had to become accessible to everyone. And I knew this from My childhood, that no matter what happens, I have to do this work.

In the same way, throughout My life—even in My married life—I kept encountering many people, and in all of that, I focused on just one thing: to understand which nature within people, because you see, there are three fundamental natures in a human being, and these three natures rotate through 360 degrees.

So you can imagine how many permutations and combinations there can be in a human being—and it's on these very small, subtle things that a human being gets stuck. Just like if a speck gets into the eye, the entire sky becomes invisible—that’s what happens.

Now, I have deeply contemplated this, performed intense *tapasya* [austerities], and reflected on it with great focus—what exactly is the flaw in human beings? Then I observed that each person's flaws are different, and they must be categorized. For example, your guru’s flaw is one such flaw—it too must be categorized. Gurus come in all kinds, meaning those who are *aguru* [not true gurus]—I do not consider them gurus, they are *aguru* [false gurus].

True gurus are very rare—extremely rare. In the past, and even now, the few genuine gurus I know truly exist, but they never wish to do anything. Because the moment they start acting, disciples either cling to them or, if they don’t, they harass them. If such gurus descend to Earth—meaning take birth or engage in any work—they suffer from childhood itself.

Because once you transcend, you will realize—you will feel others' sufferings yourself. Suddenly, something might snap—a sharp pain in the foot, some minor trouble here and there, little by little. But I thought about this and decided that a system must be found [someone bring Me a handkerchief] a system must be devised where a human being remains completely ordinary, lives a simple life, stays in household life—without needing to retreat to the forest—and yet attains liberation right there, while also being protected. He should face no suffering, no troubles. And for this reason, I had to investigate the matter very deeply.

You know that this doesn’t have any laboratory where work can be done. All of this has to be done within oneself, through one's own resolve, by awakening one's own Kundalini. Working in this way, one day—actually, in household life, it’s not possible to go alone somewhere or live in a forest—so one day, I found an excuse and went to the seashore. After spending two or three nights there, I realized that now the Sahasrara—the final chakra, the one that has not yet opened—must be opened.

It hadn’t opened until then—but now it has. So when it was opened, when I was finally able to open it, only then did it become possible to give amass realisation to people. But you might be surprised to know that what is now coming to you so easily—in the beginning, I started with just twenty-five disciples. In fact, I began with only one disciple: she was a very old woman. Even then, I put in great effort with her, but she was not able to get self realisation. While working with her, the number gradually grew to twenty-five disciples. And after two years of continuous, dedicated effort on those disciples—two whole years—only twelve of them were able to get their self realisation. With great difficulty, It took two years of relentless effort for twelve people to get their self realisation.

Because this is an entirely new thing—meaning, for ordinary people who have committed many mistakes and accumulated all kinds of flaws—correcting these flaws, aligning them properly, and guiding them to the right state was extremely difficult at that time. After two years of hard work, twelve people got their self realisation, but those twelve who did, became so refined that they are now our strong and solid people. Among them is our Raoul Bai, who is sitting here with you — she is one of them. She has attained a very high state, and all twelve of them have reached a very elevated state. So after that, of course, I saw that this number kept increasing every year. Not only that, but as more people attained self-realisation, it was as if power began to flow through them — they became carriers of that energy. And because of this growing power within them, many began to achieve self-realisation effortlessly.

You saw yesterday that many people had attained self-realization. But still, as I said, this is a very subtle thing, and even after self-realisation, it can suddenly break off. One has to nurture it again, because once a seed has sprouted, as you know, it needs to be carefully looked after. It requires protection — it has to be cared for with great love and affection.

Now for this, there is no other way except through motherhood. I mean, just today a gentleman came up to Me and said, 'What kind of organization do you have? There are no rules at all.' I said, 'Son, tell Me—what rule should I make?' He started suggesting rules like, 'People who come here shouldn’t go elsewhere; they should be restricted from returning if they do.' I said, 'I can’t do that. When they are My children, no matter what condition they are in, they must be allowed to come. He suggested all sorts of different rules. I said, 'No rules can be made here, forget about all that.' What’s the need for rules anyway? Yes, if you want to create a trust or something like that, go ahead. Even in terms of money and all, some people are saying they’ll set up a place and manage things there — that’s fine.

For that, you can do whatever you want — it has nothing to do with Me. But if you want to create rules for this, saying that My children who come to Me might make mistakes sometimes, might walk the right path sometimes — because they live in households, they are ordinary people, and their progress may happen or may not — and then if you say, ‘Sir, because of this they should be denied or removed,’ that is beyond Me. So please, kindly don’t make any rules — it will become very difficult for Me.

This is a completely different matter. If you try to look at it from a worldly perspective, it might seem very strange. But if you try to see it from the perspective of the Divine, you’ll understand. We cannot put any rules on this, no restrictions. We don’t even have a membership system. Nothing at all. Whoever wants to come, may come. Whoever doesn’t want to, need not.

Like you said — I had gone there — but there’s no membership with this. One can come whenever they want, use it as they wish, and grow as much as they like. It’s completely free. And until you are fully liberated, there’s really no benefit anyway. That’s the kind of thing this is — extremely subtle. And to attain it, you too should consider bringing some subtlety into yourself. And if, at any point, I ever say something — like I may have said to you, 'Why did you go to them? They deserve a shoe beating!. Shoe beating just has to be done — what to do? Even Prophet Mohammed spoke of it. I had started speaking very gently at first, you wouldn’t know. In the beginning, I didn’t even take on difficult people. For three years — you’ll be surprised — I never once spoke about satanic forces.

I went to London, America. And after I returned from America, in our own group, one lady started predicting horse-race numbers and hitting people with a stick in her hand, and so on. That’s when I said, 'Now I must speak openly.' That’s when I began, because I had been thinking that somehow, if people could be protected and pass through without knowing about these things, it would be better. But that’s not how it works, these things do arise — if ten people come here, surely one or two will carry some negativity or have been to places they shouldn’t have. So then I have to speak about it. There’s nothing to take offense in that. One should think about their own wellbeing, their own ascent — and there’s no need to feel bad about it.

Your guru didn’t give you anything — if he had, then why would you even come here? So when I say, 'Look, this is how it works, even Prophet Mohammed has spoken about it, My fate otherwise people would have been angry with Me. He explained it. He had many methods — in fact, the entire system of namaz is about the awakening of the Kundalini. But how many Muslims will accept this truth?

If you read Kabir thoroughly, you'll find complete Sahaja Yoga. He has written such things that, if I were to read them out to you, you'd be amazed. Like: 'Paanchon pacheeson pakad bulaoon' ['I call all five,twenty-five elements to attention' - meaning we have five senses and our body is made up of five elements, out of which other elements are contained in earth element. To express these five elements we have five senses. Every element is connected to five senses. So with five elements and for each element five senses, we are able to manifest ourselves in twenty five ways.], just like I have called you. 'Ek hi dor bandhaoon' ['I bind them with one thread.' meaning I integrate them with one thread of Kundalini.] — and there is a kind of authority in his language! That authority naturally comes when you truly know something, you speak authoritatively, You don’t whimper in it like Surdas ji (Surdas (सूरदास) was a legendary 15th-century saint, poet, and musician, best known for his devotional songs and poems dedicated to Lord Krishna) saying, 'Lord, will You ever meet me?', Because there is no separation (From the Divine), When someone sits in union(with the Divine), they speak of union. In the same way, you can understand true gurus, and you can understand poets too — the one who speaks of union speaks with certainty, with clarity. And another thing — such a person doesn’t cry out, 'Oh Lord, when will You meet me?' or 'When will You appear before me?' There have been many great poets of longing, of separation — but that tells you they are still in that state of separation. And you are also in that same state of separation — that’s why you enjoy hearing those songs of longing. But the one who has entered into union doesn’t enjoy that anymore. They feel, 'Why are these songs still calling for union? I am already there.' They don't enjoy that kind of thing. And even those who are not yet in union often dislike the ones who sing songs of union. So you too should come into that state of union — and enjoy the true joy of it.

This is a very simple and straightforward thing, and there's nothing difficult in it for you—because everything is already built within you. Everything is made, it’s just that the awakening has to happen, and then it has to be brought out through the Sahasrara and established here. Then, slowly, everything gets settled. But many people have had all kinds of gurus—one greater than the other. Even in Maharashtra, there was a very strange guru. His disciples’ Kundalini would rise, and then with a thud, it would fall back down. It would rise, then fall again. We kept tying and tying, our hands were worn out, but the Kundalini just wouldn’t stay(up)—it kept falling down. Now, just through the movement of the Kundalini itself, I can immediately tell which guru the person has followed. There are so many of them—it’s like what they call Paayali ke pachaas [Paayli's fifty - a figurative phrase used to imply exaggeration or a big number like fifty anklets in an ankle bracelet, expression used here by Mother to denote so many of so called ‘gurus’]—every day a new one shows up. One day it’s this so-and-so Maharaj, another day some other fellow appears. That means, the main ones from earlier—I can still recognize even now that this person is a disciple of so-and-so, or connected to them in some way.

But the influence [of such gurus] is so strong—just the day before yesterday, a patient came to Me. She had multiple sclerosis and wanted to get cured. She actually benefited quite a lot. But after that, she stopped coming. Then I found out that she is a disciple of one of those so-called "ring-giving babas. So she said that he comes to her in dreams at night and tells her, “Beware! [if] You go to Mother’s place?.” Out of fear, she’s not even willing to come—just sitting there, look(at this lady who is), in their relation. That’s why she’s not willing to come—even though she had benefited a lot, She’s so nervous and says, “I feel like I’ll become disloyal.” Just look at that! These gurus have such a strong hold—it’s really harmful. One should stay away from that.

If you’re influenced by some guru, then there’s no need to come to Me. But if you’re not influenced, then it’s alright. And if someone is your real guru, I’ll immediately be able to tell.

There’s a gentleman here whose guru was a Dhuni wale Baba [a baba who sat by a sacred fire]. I told him, “Ask him about Me—he must know about Me.” Not just that—many gurus have even told their disciples, “Mother has come now, so why are you coming to me?” You’d be surprised how much these people know. Those who truly know, they know. And those who don’t—well, it’s only from them that the questions arise.

There’s a very great sadhu who lives in Amarnath—[Shri Mataji asking another yogi in Marathi: Kāy nāv tyāñchā? “What is his name?”]—no, no, Nagnath! Nagnath Baba. Yes, Nagnath Baba, Nagnath, he lives there, and his disciple is Jagannath Baba. Jagannath Baba’s Agnya Chakra was damaged, so he came and started living in a place called Ambernath, near Bombay. He said, “I’m staying here because Mother is going to come here. My Guru has sent me. She will come after twelve years.” Just imagine—he sat in meditation for twelve years waiting. Then he got the indication through vibrations. One of My disciples, Sterryu, was there. He went to her and asked, “When is Mother coming? He said, My Guru said she’ll come after twelve years. Now it has already been twelve years, So when exactly is she coming?” She replied, “She is coming now. Her program is going to happen here soon.” Even then, he still had some doubt about Me—whether I was really that Mother or not. People like that develop very deep perception—especially those whose Agnya is damaged, They start seeing a lot. So he had come and was sitting in the hall. He was even invited to sit on the stage. As soon as I entered, all his doubts just vanished. He came straight to Me. I asked him, “What happened? What about your doubts?”

He said, “The moment You came in, everyone’s Kundalini stood up—just like how children in school stand up when the teacher enters. In that instant, I knew: This is the Mother. What is there left to doubt?”

But now, let Me tell you about the guru. He said to Me, “Mother, please come to our ashram.” So I went to meet him—after all, I go to everyone. You’d be surprised—I’ve gone to all of them. I even tried to explain to people like Muktananda, Rajneesh, and others—tried to tell them, “What are you people really doing?” I meet all these gurus and try to make them understand. But instead, what do they go around saying? “She is our disciple—she came to us!” Now what can you even say to such fools?

So when I went to him, I asked, “What’s the matter? Why are you so troubled?” He said, “Mother, my Agnya Chakra has been caught for the last twelve years. And my Guru told me, ‘Mother will come after twelve years—She will cure it. I won’t do it.’” I said, “Well, your Guruji is quite harsh! Your Agnya Chakra has been caught up for twelve years—and I can clear it in a single moment. And I will definitely clear it in a single moment, because My heart will keep feeling the pull, knowing that your Agnya is caught up.” And just look—she came to Me saying, “Mother, please quickly clear my Agnya, it’s caught up again.”

I said, “Alright, what happened? Why is it like this?”

He said, “Guruji also came to meet You.” So I reached the place where he was, and he gave Me a grand welcome, all due respect. Then I asked him, “Why didn’t you clear his Agnya Chakra?”

He said, “Why should I? Who cleared mine? I suffered for years—then Why didn’t you clear mine? I did this, I did that, my condition was terrible. Who cleared my Agnya Chakra? Why should I clear his? You are the Mother—you clear it.”

I said, “But there should at least be some compassion, some kindness.”

He said, “What compassion? Right now, I feel like beating him up!”

So I asked, “Why? What happened?”

He said, “I just slapped him a few times.”

Then I turned to him and asked, “What happened? Why did he hit you?”

He said, “Mother, I have this bad habit—sometimes I smoke a cigarette. Before You were supposed to come, I got a bit nervous and had one. That’s why he hit me—he said, ‘Mother is coming today, and even today you’re smoking?’”

So even those people—those gurus—they also go through a lot of intense seeking, a lot of searching. Not only that, they have very stern hearts—very strict and tough by nature. And the reason is, they’ve achieved everything with great difficulty, through tremendous struggle and hardship.

That’s just My nature—I don’t have any problem at all and after all, I am the Mother, isn’t it? so those people, they don’t even meet others, they don’t do anything, and on top of that, they are so stern, so tough in their ways. If I were to tell you stories about these gurus, you’d be surprised—how they take in their disciples, how they treat them. They’ll pick maybe one or two disciples from somewhere, just one or two, and keep them close. Then they work hard on that person. And I know one such gentleman—he trained just one disciple in twenty-five years. And even with that one, he’s upset! And frankly, he has a valid reason for it.

But that’s how things are—so finding a true Guru is truly a very difficult thing. Finding a Sadguru is extremely difficult. Because these are people who have achieved something, and they’ve done it as human beings—through their own effort. And naturally, for those who come to them, they expect the same kind of effort—they want you to work hard too, to cleanse yourself first.

I say, first give Realization. One way is to make someone clean themselves up in darkness—searching and struggling, slowly working through each thing.
The other way is to give them their eyes first—and then let them clean themselves.

There can be two ways. But mine is the way of a Mother—I simply cannot bear to watch people struggle like that. So as far as possible, I want you to get your eyes, your Self-Realization, and then quickly begin your cleansing. And attain this great Principle—this is it, there is nothing beyond this.

Without attaining the Spirit, nothing truly happens. Till today, no one has ever written that anything can happen without attaining the Spirit—It’s not written anywhere. And yet, I don’t know why people go on acting as if it’s possible.

Even those who were truly realized souls—the ones who wrote scriptures—they never wrote anything like that either. Whether you take Christ, or Prophet Mohammed, or anyone else—they all said the same thing: “You have to be born again.” That has to happen. Without that, you simply cannot understand.

Christ even said, “You will be calling Me Christ, Christ—I will not know.” That was for the Christians.He has spoken about the Kundalini many times—He said, “I will appear before you like tongues of flames.”He spoke of the “Fire Tree”, and described it in various ways—but what can the Christians understand of it?

That’s why one must understand—it is a very subtle sensitivity.

That gentleman must have been a very decent man, who served in the military—who never did anything wrong. Military people often don’t study much during service; maybe he studied later, when he became a lawyer. Military people usually stay within their own discipline, so it’s possible he didn’t do that much reading at the time.

Even through reading and study, the mind tends to become a little conditioned. Like today, I asked Rai Sahab—he said, “that MP Sahab is coming.” I said, “Alright, invite him.” Then I asked, “What’s the matter?” And he replied, “Well... the thing is,” and then he pointed out his fault—“he’s a bit too educated.”

Even that becomes a fault sometimes. When you study too much, you start forming your own concepts.

That’s why Christ said, “You have to be like small children to enter into the Kingdom of God.”

There should be an innocence like that of small children, one should have simplicity—only then it happens, and it happens very quickly that way. And after that, the joy also starts coming very quickly. For some people it takes time; for others, the joy comes first and then the full truth of it starts to unfold.

Like with ladies—they often feel the joy more, and they’re not so concerned about the truth and all that. They just sit in their joy. They’re not bothered about knowing where the Kundalini is, where the chakras are, what is what. Even the little children—they just come into their joy and fall asleep. They don’t need to know anything either. But because it is subjective knowledge, you end up knowing it—whether you understand it intellectually or not, you still just know it. How that happens—today I will tell you.

Yesterday I told you about the Nabhi chakra, and I also mentioned that if the Nabhi chakra of our country becomes enlightened, then there’s no reason why poverty in our country can’t be completely eradicated. Now, there’s one important thing I must tell you about this Nabhi chakra—something I’ve already mentioned before—that there are two channels closely associated with it, very intimately connected. Among these two nadis, the Chandra Nadi [left channel] is the one that works within our subconscious. Whatever impressions enter our mind—like a taste we experienced, or a feeling that arose in our stomach—all of that is processed through this channel. It governs the ideas and impressions that come from the subconscious. For example, take many people who have allergies. Now what is an allergy, really? It’s that somewhere in your subconscious, there's a certain impression or memory—perhaps in this life or even from a past life—where you ate something that once caused harm. That impression remains imprinted in the subconscious. So whenever that substance enters the body again, a reflex action immediately gets triggered, and the allergy manifests once more.

On the right side, there is also the Surya Nadi [the Sun channel]. In the Surya Nadi [Sun channel] as well, whatever you think or plan about the future—those thoughts are also connected to the Surya Chakra, which is located at the same place [Nabhi Chakra]. So, both the Surya [Sun - right] and Chandra [Moon - left] chakras lie on either side of the Nabhi Chakra. Now, on these nadis [energy channels], the left side channel, Moon channel, is associated with Shri Bhairavnath, whose movements extend from top to bottom, traveling along this channel. And on the right side channel, Sun channel, in that is the movement of Shri Hanuman Ji, traveling up and down that path.

Now one gentleman came and said, 'I believe only in Shri Hanumana.' I said, 'Why? but why do you believe?—there must be some reason. Why do you believe only in Shri Hanumana?' If someone gives you a mantra, or says, 'Do Surya Namaskar,' then you must ask, 'Why? What is the reason for doing it?'. Why do you need to do Surya Namaskar[Saluting the Sun through yogic postures]? There is a science behind it as well. If, within you, the Surya—the Sun—is already overactive, then there is absolutely no need for you to do Surya Namaskar. Yes, if someone has an overactive left side, then they can do Surya Namaskar. You see, the one whose left side is too dominant should work on the right side, and the one whose right side is excessive should work on the left. There is a whole science—’shastra’—behind this. It's not random. Even in the body, it doesn’t work like that. Suppose your nose is troubling you, it doesn’t mean you go and consume all the medicines in the chemist shop (buy the entire chemist’s shop)!.

So, the 'Ha' and 'Tha'—these are the two Nadis [channels]. And to keep these Nadis clean and pure, the Asanas and other practices have been prescribed, which are part of Hatha Yoga, the Ashtanga Yoga[The eight stage yogic procedures prescribed by sage Patanjal to achieve self realisation]. But if you just take one little thing from it—like saying, “We are only doing Asanas”(One of the eight prescribed methods)—then it is absolutely a wrong idea. Because why are you doing it? On which Chakra are you working? What is the need for that particular Asana(Yogic posture)? Without knowing anything, people just get up in the morning and start doing Paschimottanasana(One of the yogic postures), this Asana or that Asana—without any understanding.

And even this knowledge that came to us—it was brought by those, who went into the jungles, who also stayed with the Gurus there. And the Gurus would tell them: “You are not ready yet, you cannot go forward.” The Guru was always trying to throw them out! It is with very great difficulty that a Guru will keep someone(As his disciple). You have to climb seven stories before they accept you. And at every stage, they will hit you with a tong—to see how strong your head is, how much faith you have in your Guru. Only when a person becomes absolutely steady and balanced, only then is he accepted by the Guru. Otherwise, these half-baked people—who just leave halfway through—pick up a little bit of this Asana or that practice, and come out thinking they are Gurus! Then they start teaching others.

So much harm is done by Hatha Yoga—by these so-called Hatha Yogis. I’m only talking about those who do just Asanas. Always, their Heart Chakra gets caught up. There is one gentleman, may be sitting here—he developed heart trouble by doing Hatha Yoga. Then they told him, “Now that you have a heart problem, you should do some other Asanas—for the heart.” So I said, “On what basis? What is the connection?” This is what we call ‘Samyak Gyaan’—Integrated Knowledge. And that can only happen when you see the whole.

So these two nadis which are on either side of the Nabhi Chakra—one must take great care of them. Now out of these, the left side channel, it is because of that I warn you against so-called gurus. Why? Because everything that is dead, everything that is in the subconscious, everything that is from the past—all of that exists on this left side. Beyond that lies your collective subconscious—on the left side. So all that is dead resides there. Now some people, even after dying, do not feel satisfied — they are very troublesome spirits. Sometimes due to suicide, or sometimes even parents, after dying, they feel, “Let us go back to our children.” They just keep hovering around, and these people who are hovering like that — they are the ones who affect us. These are the ones what are called bad spirits or spirits in English. They are dead souls. And among these dead souls, there are some who are wise, they go to their own realm, to the preta-loka. They do not enter into anyone, they do not affect you.

There are many such people wandering around. Then, nowadays many of those who call themselves gurus are actually demons, many are demons, like Mahishasura has taken birth, Ravana has taken birth, and Bakasura has taken birth, and [[what is his name? Rakt] A sahaja yogi suggesting the name of demon Raktabeej] Raktabeej has taken birth. Many such demonic people and even demonesses have taken birth, and now they are sitting as gurus. These people have also brought their own armies, which are like viruses.

If they sit on your Agnya Chakra, then it will go to your left side and you will be pulled to that direction. The problem of the left side, in this people suffer in various ways. For example, in your homes, suddenly, people feel that Ganapati [Lord Ganesha] has arrived. This is happening in Kaliyuga and it has never happened before. You ask Me, “Mother, Ganpati has come to my house”; what should I do? I tell them, “throw it into the sea”. What is the need to bring Ganapati? This is not the work of the Divine. Moving material objects from one place to another, does God have no other work?.

Now that Ganpati [Idol Of Ganesha] arrives home, people start worshipping it. Like this lady who was sitting here—she also has the same badha, left side. It gives pain in the body, body starts shaking. All, whatever mental illness cases we have, all these are because of the left side. In many homes these issues happen, where spirits reside. Just yesterday, a Sikh gentleman came [to see Me], his wife was in great pain. Came to know they had an old house, she had also started seeing some things at night.

Once you enter that area, you go to the area of the subconscious, you start seeing these ghosts. This is true that they exist. But one should never step onto their path. The greatest work in this matter was done by Christ. Christ resides on the Agnya Chakra, he has worked the most on this, that one should not get involved with spirits or ghosts. One should not have anything to do with them. However, you will be surprised to know that of all the people, Christians believe in spirits more than anyone else. And they [spirits] enter into them [Christians].

In London there is no church wherein dead bodies are not buried. If you are a realized soul, you will not be able to go into that church, where they have already buried the dead. Even in places like Westminster Abbey, where kings, emperors who had killed seven seven wives, their dead bodies are buried. If it is of a saint then it is all right, one can say they have built a samadhi [burial]. It is very wrong to bury dead bodies of kings and emperors, because especially of that place they are great malpractitioners.

In our place[India], these people[kings] are virtuous, but in those places, kings and emperors are malpractitioners. And their corpses are buried there. And all the people do plainchant in these places. In their place, Pentecostal and what not, among Christians, ghostology rituals are the most common. But even in India, ghostology is not uncommon. Tantrics have achieved this ghostology. And then they this, If you give them five rupees, they will say, We will kill him or do something else or we can put a ghost behind him. This is a very common thing.

Tribal people do a lot of such work. And then they roam around as gurus. They put spirits in you people, and here you are putting rings on them, giving them clothes, giving them jewelry. In this I will tell one or two things. There was a woman from a wealthy family and her husband. Her husband once came to see Me. He told Me, “A babaji [holy man] gave me a ring.” I asked, “You are such a rich man, how many rings do you have?” He said, “ I have many.” Then I asked him, “Then why did you accept this ring?” He said, “He gave it to me as prasad, so I accepted it.”

I asked, Why did he give it to you? He could have given it to your driver instead. If he is such a great donor, why doesn’t he solve the economic problems of our country? Why did he give it to you, because he must have cheated you of something. The man said, “No, I was not cheated.” I said, “Then why have you come to Me?” I am not going to give you all these things. If you want a ring etcetera, then go to a bullion store and buy one. But if you have come to Me, then I will give you the absolute truth. However, you must first throw that ring into the sea.

The man said, “No, Mother, we came to you because many of the diamonds of our house have gone missing.” I told him, “Bring your wife along.” She was a lady doctor. When she arrived, I saw that she was possessed by a spirit. I gave her a bandhan and saw a ghost sitting in her and I took out her ghost. I started talking to her.

I asked her, “What happens to you?” She said, “I don’t know why but some man enters inside me starts saying, ‘These are just stones, just stones, give these to baba’ and it is only me who gives it to him.” I myself give these to him. I said, Is it so? Then she started saying, what should I do, all the time that man is bothering me, keeps giving me suggestions, comes and stands in front of me and tells me these are stones. Then I told her, “You are such an educated woman, and you are also married. Now whatever diamonds or whatever is with you, these were given to you by your husband or of hard earned money or given by your parents, whatever it is. And you live in a household, you should wear some jewelry. In a household women are required to wear ornaments, they have to remain decorated. You are the one who needs these. If these are stones for you, then what should it be for that man? Clay. Why is that babaji taking them from you? Why don’t you think like this?”

When I jolted her intellect, she got awakened. She started trembling. Anyway she has recovered now, and their problem is also solved. But I am telling you as a matter of fact that people do such things as to how to put someone into a delusion. So long as you keep wearing that ring, you will not have the strength to think of something else. You will be overwhelmed by that ring. This to the extent that even if you put a dot [coloured dot] on your forehead by their hand, then you are a gone case.

They are also very clever. They know your weaknesses and where to target you. Left sided people have a lot of weaknesses and they catch you in various ways, especially women. Women are particularly very weak in this regard. They describe to them falsely about their husbands, asking them does your husband look after you? Does he buy you jewelry? They say, no he doesn’t. Then they tell her, he is involved with some other woman. That is how they fill their minds with falsehood. And “I was your husband in your previous life.” They often do that. Even highly educated women believe such stupid things. And then, that’s it, they hand over all their jewellery to them.

These left-side issues have arisen here in our country because different kinds of false gurus have sprung up. And they are practicing this spiritism, tantrism. In the olden times in our country, they used to call it Pandora’s box [Bhanumati ka pitara - a source of calamities and adversities]. You may think, like people of My father’s age knew about such things. But you people have become English [Those who think very highly of oneself]. Mr Macaulay has taught you English [Thomas Babington Macaulay is often considered the "father of modern education in India" for his role in introducing the English education system and making English the medium of instruction] and you know all these things.

Even now our tribal people do a lot of such practices. They can pierce their bodies without bleeding. Sometimes, they hang themselves and jump around from here to there. Are these works of God? It's a question of musing about it. Then these people croak like frogs and sometimes roar like lions. Now do you want to become a frog or a lion? If you understand this, you will not allow such things to enter your Nabhi Chakra.

For this, in our Sahaja Yoga there are very easy solutions for this by which you can save yourself and you will have to save yourself. Going out at midnight, etcetera is very wrong. So much, these evil tendencies are hovering above. Then people take to alcohol. Alcohol weakens your Nabhi Chakra. Once Nabhi becomes weak, it doesn’t take long. On an alcoholic person the spirit of another alcoholic person enters, which then consumes the alcohol, leaving the actual drinker without any enjoyment of drinking.

In Cuba, I met a woman whose husband told Me, extremely thin and petite [Mother telling about that woman], that, “she could drink an entire bottle of whiskey, ‘neat’ [unmixed and without water]”. I asked her, "How do you manage to drink like that?" She replied, "Mother, don’t you see, inside me lives a gigantic Negro spirit. He drinks, I don’t drink. He drinks and tells me, 'make me drink this.' Anyhow, she has recovered now. But such things happen.

There are so many such cases that if I start telling you all in detail, it would turn into an entire saga. However, you will encounter such things daily.

Now, when some of our Sahaja Yogis experience such issues, they recognize them immediately. They say, "Yes, Mother, we know”, because they have seen this happen everyday. They see these dramas every day, and what is this business of spirits.

For example, if I tell someone, "Do not touch My Feet," there should be no reason to be upset about it. The other day there was this woman and her husband came to see Me. I had already told them that he should not touch My feet, yet the woman forced him to do [touch My Feet] so and immediately he fainted at My feet.

If someone has epilepsy, then he will surely experience a seizure in front of Me. Because they all do such tantrums and do things against protocols before Me.

The spirits that possess people and make them do strange things, are often mistaken with manifestations of the power of Devi [Goddess]. This is very common. People say, "Oh, the goddess has come into them”. In our Maharashtra, almost every housemaid claims to be possessed by a goddess. But think about it—does a goddess have no other work than to enter housemaids? Just think over it that in such maids Devi has entered.

This belief is so common and deeply rooted in our society that even educated people fall into this trap and believe it. The biggest issue is that people do not think logically—why would the Divine engage in such foolishness?

There are different kinds of people, and their activities cannot even be fully described.

Now, there are people on the right side, about whom I shall describe. I recently went to Kovalam, and in Kovalam I saw something very surprising that people were burying dead bodies inside their homes. They were also cremating dead bodies right there.

I asked them, "Why do you do this?"

Just imagine how much negativity this brings! Such practices will only bring poverty.

From one side the spirits come in, and from the other Goddess Lakshmi departs.

From this side a bottle of alcohol enters the house, and from the other side Goddess Lakshmi disappears.

Now you must understand that if we keep the Nabhi Chakra all right, means if you attend someone’s funeral, you should simply meet them and leave. That’s it.

Even when it comes to your own parents, you should say, (To their spirits after their death) "We are fine, and now you should take your birth again. Do not worry about us—you are in another realm, and we are in a different one."

Reading too much about death, reading about the third eye, reading about the ghost world, from all these things the Nabhi Chakra is spoiled and the left side is caught up.

Secondly people also work like that on the right side. Right side work is like this, that on the right side we have the chakra of Shri Ramchandra ji and of Shri Hanuman ji. So they will work on the right side, that they will give you a mantra of Shri Ram. Someone will say now recite the mantra of Shri Ram, they enter into trance. Now, a spirit of the name Ram enters you, The Divine cannot enter like this, Isn’t it?

What have you done that God enters in you? Do you have any true connection with the Divine? People call upon God as if He is sitting in their pocket or as if He is their servant.

If there’s some sort of work, "Get my son a job, Shri Ram." "Cure my wife, Shri Ram."

But do you have any spiritual wealth deposited with God? I say that even if you wish to meet a king, then also you have to inquire about it seventeen times [many times] you have to bow down, you have to inquire, show respect, [follow the proper protocol] only then do you get to meet with him. You cannot meet him directly.

And the one who is the Emperor of Kings, you call him as if He is sitting next to you.

They will give you any such name, they will give you ‘aeem’,they will give you ‘hrym’. And some people [pseudo gurus] give such strange names, from America ‘aa’[or] from South Africa, one gentleman who does not know sanskrit, then they taught the name to the boys, some of My disciples have come from there, they spent an entire year cramming that name, what was it? "Inga, Pinga, Thinga."

Even a common Indian will understand this [was nonsense], but those poor people kept cramming it for a whole year. And all their Agnya Chakra and Nabhi Chakra became caught up.

One must understand these two channels. This is ghost knowledge.

Those who were highly ambitious in life, move towards the right side, after death.

If they enter you, like a spirit comes in, it never had a moment of peace in its own life, and it will not let you sit peacefully either.

That restless spirit feels that he has not done any work [in his life], now he enters inside you as a spirit. He will make you run like, your speed in life might be like a bicycle, but he [spirit inside you] will make you move at jet speed. In a few days, your body will start behaving erratically. Such people, after 10 years, begin to rattle, the whole body shakes uncontrollably.

One must understand what this thing is. One must realize that these spirits have come from supra-conscious. And once they enter your system, they take over. Even governments acknowledge this phenomenon because they want people who can work at high speed. So, they insert a spirit [bhoot] inside them. One must think how this happens. And they will never explain the know-how of this like I am telling you in detail about Kundalini. And you can also maneuver it after realisation. They will not explain such things to you. They will not tell you that. They will only say, "Just keep chanting the name." These people have an entire assembly of spirits with them and strange things.

Just now, a man came to Me in London. He is working in America as a teacher of ghost-related practices. And his condition, that Shringa, he said, "I chant the name of Shringa." I said, "Shring was a great sage! This, I do not know what’s the matter, how did you end up being possessed by a spirit?" I asked him, "What happens to you?" He said, "All the time I have suicidal tendency. His parents brought him to Me that thrice he had attempted suicide. What should we do about him? He said, "I don’t know what happens to me, but something happens inside me which compels me to end my life." Then I looked at him carefully and saw that Shringa sahab [Sir] had one horn, he was a ghost [bhoot], a mighty ghost [Mahabhoot].

Then I asked him, "Why are you doing this kind of business?" He said, "I want that many people should die and that all those(spirits) who are under our control, will strengthen our empire."

This is the kind of illegal business these people are doing. You have no idea about these dark worlds, and you should never get caught in these traps. Stay in the central path, that is on Sushumna Nadi.

In this way, you must protect your Nabhi Chakra by all means. The greatest protection for the Nabhi Chakra is when we recognize and accept the Divine. Our true quest should be for the soul, for the Spirit. Only when our seeking is for the Spirit then only our Nabhi Chakra remains protected. If your seeking is for other things, then your Nabhi will never be secure. And there is nothing to be nervous about.

In our country, people are constantly nervous, always running after money, believing that they must earn money by whatever means, even if it involves cutting someone’s throat, then also one must earn money, even if someone is to be defamed, doesn’t matter, even if they have to lie, it doesn’t matter. Money has to be earned somehow. I call this thing "Sin Against the Father." I have named it “Sin Against the Father”. And the left sided people, the foreign people to them I call "Sin Against the Mother."

There are two kinds of sins. First, in our country, In India, we call it "Sin Against the Father" because we do not know that God is our Supreme Father and He is omnipotent, all-powerful. And He is looking after everything about us.Then why are we shaken so much? Why are we so caught in calamity? Why do we steal, cheat, and engage in immoral activities? If we truly know that our Supreme God is everything and He is ours, why do we resort to such immoral acts? If we have fewer radio sets [fewer possessions], then what is the calamity? Even from that [possessions] it does not seem to give any joy. If one understands this thing, that from being contented, the Divine, the Almighty who is our father who gives us whatever,  "Whichever way He keeps me, I will remain that way."

Sometimes, I think that a person sleeping on the street is more at peace than a person who is writing cheques in a bank. I don’t even know how to write these things. I don’t even understand money, I have no knowledge of all these things. But I always live in complete joy. If you have something, that’s fine. If you don’t, that’s also fine. For this reason, why worry so much? If God has given us something then we are living comfortably, and if He has not, then we are not living like that. What is there to be upset about? And to impress others, to make false exaggerated claims about one’s wealth, there is nothing sensible in this.

If a man lives in a simple way he is still venerable. And if he lives in a luxurious way then he is still condemnable. Mostly he is condemnable. If someone drives around in a big, fancy car, then poor people say, "Ah, he must have earned the car by making money through corruption." Then why to show off, doing it will only lead to criticism. So, if you live a moderate life and don’t be excessively greedy about anything, then only the Nabhi Chakra can remain well-organized.

So this was about, “Sin Against the Father”. And “Sin Against the Mother” is done by Western people. What it means is that they have lost all sense of shame. They have abandoned morality completely. For them, there is no concept of family, of mother, sister, or brother. They have all become followers of Freud. And that’s why they have created so much filth in the world that I feel ashamed even talking about it and it is unspeakable. All these people have become completely corrupt and immoral, absolutely immoral people.

I feel a sense of disgust from these people, even hearing about them and I do not understand if you watch TV and there’s it, go somewhere and there’s it, as if they have no other work left in life. There is no real joy in their lives. They are trapped in filth, yet they call it freedom.

They do not realize that they have imposed the greatest form of slavery upon themselves. They have adopted bad habits and have become completely useless. They carry all kinds of filthy diseases within them. Their women have become immoral, and none of them seem to have any eternal values left in them.

With the help of Sahaja Yoga, we were able to settle down three hundred people and bring them onto the right path. And materialism, what we call materialism, if you become materialistic then you will be happy, is not true at all. They are the most miserly people, extremely stingy. They never spend even a penny. If you visit their homes, they won’t even offer you a seat. Even a rat would hesitate to enter their house. That is how these people are, extremely miser. You are untouched by that, you don’t realize how innocent and pure-hearted you are. You have simplicity, and you have respect for your mothers and sisters because our country is the Yoga Bhumi [land of yoga]. In this land how much one may fall here, to what extent one may fall. How far one can go, it is difficult to break free from the spiritual bondage of this land.

Even then you may see, if you look here, you will be surprised, there is not a single foreigner who has come here on his own. These ones present here are those who have come with Me. Not a single foreigner has come after seeing the advertisement. Not a single foreigner has come after seeing My advertisement. And if a few do come, they immediately flee because as soon as I tell them that after Sahaja Yoga, you will have to live a life of righteousness. Because for them, righteousness seems like something so rigid, they immediately dismiss it by saying, ‘Oh, she’s just like that aunty, that so-and-so lady, and Shri Mataji preaches in the same way.

Yet even after this, in a city like London, we have established three hundred people in this path [Sahaja Yoga], about whom you may assume that these people are truly righteous and belong to the highest level of spirituality, and you may also assume that these people have become very deep in this respect [Spirituality]. These people have worked very hard. They have completely abandoned all dirty things and have put in great effort. There is one more thing about them that is they have a great quest for truth. If someone tells them that there is truth in something, and if they should achieve that, then they hold onto it firmly.

This is why I have spent so much time talking about the Nabhi Chakra because it is extremely important for us. Now, what are all the diseases that we can get by spoiling our Nabhi Chakra, I will tell you that. When the Nabhi Chakra becomes bad, the first disease that is caused is called liver [imbalanced Liver], the right side, the liver becoming bad. Now in Sahaja Yoga, we can completely heal the liver, and how it should be done, I will explain that to you.

The second thing is to have an imbalance, meaning this nadi or that nadi. If right nadi(channel) is very active, if a person thinks too much or contemplates, then he gets diabetes and diseases like that which are related and linked to his spleen, pancreas, kidneys, and uterus.

I have already told you some deep truths about the Nabhi Chakra that if a person drinks alcohol, or gets involved in spirit-related activities, then also Nabhi Chakra is severely damaged. And one more speciality of Nabhi Chakra is that it holds dharma [righteousness] in it. If you, now I will share something about Myself, if someone makes Me even look at a photo of a nude woman, I immediately vomit, immediately vomit. I don’t think with My brain; My dharma is in My stomach [Abdomen]. If someone does something immoral, I immediately vomit, or in some cases, I get diarrhea for two-three [days] that. This is a direct and simple rule. For that I do not think, I do not speak ill about anything of anybody, but when it sees something impure, it reacts. My stomach [Abdomen] thinks. The stomach thinks, the brain does not think.

So the Dharma is in the stomach [Abdomen]. And that is why in our country food and drinking habits are advised a lot. But whatever is advised, is completely misunderstood by us. The consideration is that a Brahmin should not eat food prepared by just anyone. Brahmin means a realized soul. If a realized soul eats food prepared by a non-realized person, then the vibrations of his hand become bad and he suffers. That is why it was said so. But if he links it to caste, however today society is divided based on caste, of different kinds, if he is a scheduled caste [someone belonging to a so-called lower caste in India] and is a realised soul then also it is forbidden for him that such a Brahmin who takes money in the name of God, one should never eat food prepared by such a person [Brahman]. This is the meaning of untouchability. Its deeper meaning is that a person who is a realized soul, should not eat food prepared by an unrealised soul, or at the very least, one should never eat food prepared by a wicked person.

Now, when you go to fake gurus, they feed you as a result of which your Nabhi [Chakra] goes missing [gets completely blocked]. These fake gurus have opened free food centers. You lose your nabhi [blocked] and you lose all your money to them. Either they [fake gurus] give you "vibhut" [sacred ash] to eat. In whomever‘s stomach this ‘vibhut’ goes, he loses his Nabhi Chakra. Laxmi Narayan [Presiding deity of Nabhi] sleeps completely in that person.

This is why I have told you about Nabhi that you have to maintain its balance and with devotion. Those people who maintain their balance, there is another special quality about Nabhi, thinking too much about food. This is also a huge problem in our country. From morning till evening women are always cooking, and they have this hobby, how to make their husband stupid. Men also become stupid about food. They do not know how to cook by themselves, they do not know at all how to work with their hands. If the woman [wife] goes to her mother’s home, the man is in a bad condition. Women know this thing very well. They prepare different kinds of such foods, there is a saying "Possess your husband through his stomach." They also do [possess their husbands] such a thing. One may assume that this too is a kind of phantasm. [Mother and sahaja yogis laugh]

And menfolk are also thinking about food day and night, we want this to eat, today we would like to have this, we would like to have that. Women become busy with this. Although I also cook very good food, but, it is very wrong to keep thinking about food all the time. Like we want to have this, we want to have that, or eating too much is a sign of bhoot.

In India, some of us eat so much that it is no surprise that some people have no food to eat. Not some people but most people eat so much that it is very surprising. You wouldn’t believe it, but I have seen with My own eyes.

Once there was a ‘Shraadh’ [ritual for deceased ancestors] at our home, when our sister-in-law said, "You are performing shraadh, in this you must feed at least five Brahmins." I said, "Let’s feed two hundred poor people instead? I don’t like this Brahmin [feeding] ritual nonsense." But she insisted on it, so I agreed. They [Brahmins] arrived and said, "there is no need to do much, just bring five kilos of ‘Kalakand’ [Indian milk cake] for each of us." I thought they would take it [Milk Cake] home. They had such big big bellies and they came and they sat down and ate the entire five kilos of Kalakand before Me in one hour. I can never forget that. I kept thinking, if these people are eating five kilograms each, then there would be many others who would not get this much [very small amount].

When people sit down to eat, it turns into a competition in our country. One gentleman ate sixty three ‘Gulab Jamuns’ [Indian Fried Dough Balls in Sugar Syrup] and went around boasting about it, proudly telling everyone, "I ate sixty three Gulab Jamuns!" Is this the way?

These are symptoms of being an evil spirit, just like Bakasura [A demon from Hindu mythology, particularly mentioned in the Mahabharata, known for his enormous appetite and cruelty]. Where is the need for eating like that? A human being can survive with very little food. There is no need to overeat. One should eat in moderation. But those who do not eat at all, fasting types are totally useless. There is no need to fast in Kaliyuga [the present age]. Fasting is forbidden here [in Sahaja Yoga]. In our Sahaja Yoga it is forbidden. No form of fasting is to be done. Only on the day of Naraka Chaturdashi [Day before Hindu festival of Deepawali], one should get up late and observe fast because on that day, the gates of hell are open. On other occasions like on Chaturthi [Fourth day of lunar calendar], on Sankashti,  on Chaturthi or Ganesh Chaturthi, on the day of Ganesha Chaturthi all the people observe fast.

One gentleman came to Me, he was suffering from a prostate gland problem. He was a great devoted worshipper of Ganesha, a noble man and also a very good Sahaja Yogi. I was very surprised. I said how did this person develop a prostate gland problem because I have told you that near the prostate gland is the chakra of Shri Ganesha. So I just gave him chana, I usually give ‘chana’ [chickpeas] as My prasad, so I took out the chana and gave it to him. He hesitated and made a face. Another man nearby said, "Oh, he is fasting today." I asked, "What is the occasion today for which fast is being observed?" He said, "Today is Lord Ganesha’s birth anniversary, so I am observing a fast." I said that’s a good way [Asking in a surprised way]. The day someone is born, does one observe ‘sutak’ [a period of ritual impurity observed following significant life events such as births]?

In the same way, the day Shri Ram Chandra is born, the day Lord Shiva is born, that day [people fast]. How wrong are these traditions? These Brahmins are being used to make you stupid. Think logically, when a baby is born in our home, that day we celebrate with joy and distribute sweets, or do we sit in mourning and observe fast? All this wrong practice of fasting, then Ekadashi fasting. The day ekadashi fast is observed, one keeps thinking all the time, how to procure chestnut flour, from where will that [something else] come? Since early morning, people keep brooding about what they are going to eat that day. What will happen today? What shall be cooked today. Is this fasting? The attention should be light.

Constantly thinking about food, day and night results only in one dying from hunger because if someone has a liver disease, then he will die of hunger. If he has some suffering from some ailment then he will die of hunger. There are many such things that can force a person to remain hungry. So then, why are you remaining hungry under compulsion? If there is some problem in the body then the person remains hungry. If someone’s stomach has some trouble then he remains hungry. Then why do you remain hungry under compulsion?

Yes, one should be well-nourished, eat simple food and eat balanced food, but there is no need to think about food so much. In general whatever is available, a Sahaja Yogi should simply eat that, after vibrating it. This way, the state of your Nabhi Chakra will remain all right. Now, why did I emphasize on Nabhi so much, I am telling you that.

[Mother Speaking to someone : Sit down, My child, get your realisation, where are you going? He is just a specimen.What to do?]

Because the Nabhi Chakra is extremely important, which is why I have spoken about it in detail. Over the next three to four days, I will explain about all the chakras to you. But the Nabhi Chakra is extremely important, and it must be properly understood that if for any reason the Nabhi Chakra becomes spoiled like there is disease of the liver, for example, if by mistake in the childhood, if you give heavy foods to children like chocolates, or what you call it, Rabdi [traditional Indian milk-based dessert renowned for its rich and creamy texture] etcetera, heavy things, then one gets liver. Similarly, overworking can also spoil the liver. However, this can be corrected. Through Sahaja Yoga, all diseases can be cured and balance can be maintained.

The most important thing is that human attention resides in the Nabhi Chakra. The attention [Chitta] is sustained by your liver. If you focus your attention on food, then you are lost in food.

However, when the same attention ascends towards God, then only one truly becomes a human being. As long as this attention  remains engrossed in pragmatic things, in hither and thither, what you say towards superficial things, attention is trapped then that attention shall always remain in a mess, unstable.

But the same attention when it thinks that it has to only attain God and everything else is meaningless, then only the attention ascends and covers the kundalini and when the kundalini rises the attention which covers the kundalini becomes one with the all pervading power of God.

This is why the Nabhi Chakra is very essential, by which your attention should be balanced, and there should be just one emotion that this food also is a sacrificial act and we are eating it for that but especially the greatest thing is that we have to seek God. This attention when it rises from here, when it rises then it passes through different chakras and eventually comes out. In the beginning, when this attention is in animal form, it does not seek God. Only in the human state it rises toward the Divine. As long as this emotion remains within you, that in the end, I have to only attain God, your Nabhi Chakra will remain very balanced.

This is the same as this verse: "Tvamekam Varenyam, Tvamekam Sharanyam."
[You alone are worthy of being chosen, You alone are my refuge.]

There is nothing else that I have to attain. In this way if we maintain the balance in our Nabhi Chakra, then your nabhi chakra will always remain in a healthy state. And if this [Balanced Nabhi] happens for our entire country then our country’s future will become fulgent.  Because, as I have mentioned before, our country has a strong spiritual foundation and most major Divine Incarnations were born here. All the incarnations of Lord Vishnu were born here [In India].

All the incarnations of Shri Vishnu appeared on the Nabhi Chakra. You know about the ‘Dashavatar’ [Ten Incarnations of Shri Vishnu], which is absolutely right. This is also the tale of our [spiritual] evolution.

Just as a fish [Incarnated as Matsya Avatar] first exists in water, then moves to land and becomes a tortoise [Kurma Avatar], reptiles. Similarly during every stage of evolution that we have crossed at were at the Nabhi Chakra. In the end all incarnations like Parashurama [Sixth incarnation of Shri Vishnu] etcetera remained at the Nabhi.

Only the chakra above that which has not been shown here, [Mother talking to someone about it] is on the right hand side, aaaa... which is called the right hand side of heart, where Shri Rama incarnated. It is not in the centre because He did not declare Himself as Incarnation. Instead, He chose to declare Himself as Maryada [boundaries of dharma [duty and virtue]] Purushotam [The supreme man] [He is the embodiment of self-restraint, righteousness, and the ideal way of living—a role model for humanity.] That’s why He moved to a side [Right] away from the path of Incarnations [Central path of incarnations of Shri Vishnu]. However, His chakra remains extremely important, and I will explain that in great detail tomorrow.

Now, let us all go into meditation. Tomorrow morning also, we will have meditation here, just meditation. In the evening, I will explain about the chakras. Now, if anyone has any questions, what are you saying?

Shri Mataji : What is he saying? [Inaudible clutter in the background]

So you will be surprised, please come be seated, be seated. The foreigners are better than us in this respect. Hmm! You talk to these [foreign Sahaja Yogis] people, they shall teach you who Shri Rama is. They have become self realised [like you], but you will be surprised, you do not have that thing within you. I always say this, “when you have teeth, you do not have roasted gram and when you have roasted gram, you do not have teeth” [Common folk saying to describe a condition when you have teeth, you do not have money to buy roasted gram or chickpeas and vice versa]. When these people [foreign sahaja yogis] received their realisation they gave up all the useless things of the world and dedicated themselves completely to it [Sahaja Yoga]. And the extent to which they are experts, you are not. They know each and every aspect of Shri Ram. And they know all aspects of Shri Hanumana, you only have to dedicate yourself. They can sort out any problem. They are not half baked like us because we have knowledge of everything about religion, so it does not come to our senses. Who is Shri Ram, what are His different aspects and what are His specifications, all his nuances and My, with them, the extent to which they have received from Me, you will never be able to understand. Here I see that while I am conducting a program, everyone comes. But afterward, they disappear and then no one shows up at the program. However we have got the chart prepared and everything has been given so clearly. The amount of hard work which these people have done, you can never do that sir.

I may tell you this. These people don’t have assets like you have. You have huge ancient assets [religious wealth]. But you are not hard working. This is absolutely true. An Indian is rarely hard working. They are sitting here, you may ask them. Sahaja yogis will tell you how much money they have spent to come here and they are roaming with Me in the countryside. They are moving with Me everywhere. How many sahaja yogis [Indian] are moving with Me? These people have come from London and are giving realisation to the world.

Yesterday they were giving realisation in the university and the young people [Indian yogis] were just sitting here and have left now. You do not have depth like them. That is very true. Their [religious] wealth is less than yours, less than yours. You receive your self-realisation very fast and after receiving it, give it up also very easily, because like something, like there is a rich man, how are his sons. You are like that. They get a lot of money, spend all of it, have fun and spend all the money.

They have received their self realisation with a lot of hard work that’s why they know its importance more [than you]. They have no problem. They are much more capable than us. Just talk to them. If you are a Vaishnav, they shall explain the entire Vaishnav religion to you. All right? That’s why I am saying that the book we are printing, you must read that. A Foreigner has written it and it shall open your eyes [Impress you tremendously]. All of them have collectively worked hard in this but your eyes shall open wide looking at the depth they have achieved. The work of Shri Ram and work of Shri Hanuman and how much they have understood that and how devoutly they have understood, you can never estimate. Not only that, our children who have gone there, out of that a few have become like them. They started saying, when we came to these foreign lands, we discovered how great our culture is. What is its importance and after that we understood its significance.

Their goodness is something else. There is something else about you, you do not know anything about your culture, you know nothing, what do you know about it? You have all become gentlemen [Sir]. The only thing is that you do not wear a tailcoat, rest you have become gentlemen. Gentlemanship has come in you. Nobody knows anything about his culture. It is not there in our education system that we talk about our culture.

All are [ignorant], to the extent that even small small things are not known to people. Nothing was known to them and I was surprised. Recently I visited Kovalam [a place in Kerala state of India] and there they had invited some journalists. I don’t know, they said, “some journalists would come”, I said, “all right”. Then first thing they said upon arrival, “if we each get a bottle of whiskey then only we shall come”. At least these [foreign sahaja yogis] people never talk like that. I said, “you chase away all these people. It is not necessary, I do not want even one person, chase them all away”.

Then some of them came, helpless ones who were noble, came. Even after coming there, we should sit with devotion [as] Mother is talking, nothing [of the sort]. They sat there like very pompous people, wearing suits and boots, like donkeys. I did not even feel that I should explain anything to them or do something for them. Within ten minutes I said, “finish them off, they are all useless people”.

Out of them one did such a foolish thing, I said to him, “in your land, Kerala, great men like Adishankaracharya had taken birth”. He started saying, “is it so, we never knew about him”. Another one said, “I don't even know who Adishankaracharya is”. By saying this they were just showing off. We feel very proud that we do not know anything about our country and we know everything about foreign lands. By this we start thinking that we have become very great people.

By this you do not know such are never respected in this world. That's why our Indian brothers who have reached there [foreign countries] are never respected. They shall respect you when you become Indian in the real sense and Indianness is the greatest thing. But I don’t see Indian people. All have become English and the chains of slavery that we are wearing that even now if you cannot speak Hindi it is alright, but you should not speak wrong English. English should be proper. Do people in Japan speak English?, and people of all countries speak English?

Not only that, you will be surprised that muslims who are My disciples, know more than you. They know a thousand times more than you. Whenever you meet those people, the muslims who are My disciples, you will be surprised. But I cannot say about My disciples of this place, no hard work, no hard work, only showing off, less hard working. Now let us see what you shall do. Next year when I come here I will find out one person has come, the other one has not come and the third has run away, the fourth one cannot sit — I have always seen such specimens here. Do not worry about these people, My son, worry about yourself.

Shall we go into meditation now? We are giving you Vaishnava dharma only, this is Vaishnav only. Evolution takes place only through Vaishnava dharma. This is Vaishnava dharma but Vaishnav does not mean that there is no work/role of Lord Shiva, Shiva also has a very important work/role. Yes, son? Concentration, but that concentration is a different thing and this concentration is a different thing. That’s why there will be confusion in that too. Please fill it with water, okay, just water, not this, they don’t drink tea.

[Shri Mataji speaking in English]

What is the need to pull out your guts [no need to strain yourself], sit comfortably, it does not mean that you become a lazy lump, this is not what I mean. But there's no need to go to such extremes. Are there any other questions, now? Shall we go into meditation. Yours is also left. Son, your question won't be solved right now, just take your self realisation. You are stuck in just a circumgyration, your Agnya is caught up in such a way, that's it, he is a great evil person, what is his name?

[Section in English of 11 minutes 46. Starts at 1:07:54]

Sahaja Yogi: Mother, do we have to concentrate on particular plexus?
Shri Mataji: No. Nothing. That’s what I’m trying to tell you.
In Sahaja Yoga, it is a spontaneous thing, you don’t have to do anything at all. It is a spontaneous process. The Kundalini itself rises and tells the person who’s giving you Realisation that this is the problem with the gentleman. So, the gentleman who is seeking, this ‘sadhaka’ [seeker] feels nothing about it but the other fellow, the one who is giving Realisation feels. So, he can manoeuvre because he’s a Realised soul, the vibrations are flowing, he can manoeuvre, he can give a bandhan, he can give nourishment to that chakra and, can make that chakra all right and raise the Kundalini higher. It is the one who is Realised can do it.

After Realisation, now many people have taught that you much concentrate here [Agnya Chakra]. It’s a wrong idea. Absolutely wrong, I don’t know who has taught this because if you concentrate here, this is just a window, which should not be, at all, opened. You should go straight-forward, take your ‘chitta’ (attention) upward through the Sahasrara. Or if you concentrate here your attention will go out of the window and that is what happens to people who try to concentrate there, they start seeing visions and
yesterday only, there was one gentleman who was saying, [Shri Mataji talking to someone :Is it better now? Hnn, I will have to cure him.], so what happens, you start seeing visions, then you move to the left and right. You go to the Supra-conscious side then you will see lights, this/that.  If you go to the left-hand side you will see all the previous lives of, say, Shri Rama, Sita, this/that, you see the history. You have passed through that, so you see all that. You have to be in the present and for that you have to come out of your Sahasrara. So, all this is wrong.

Sahaja Yogi: About seeing Lights.[inaudible sounds in the background]
Shri Mataji: Even if you see that, that is, you are not seeing yours because you do not see. If it is your own you don’t see it. You see, if you are sitting inside you don’t see it from outside. If you are seeing something that means you are outside. When you are inside you do not see, you must be seeing somebody else’s. Not yours own.
Sahaja Yogi: Re: seeing with closed eyes.
Shri Mataji: With the closed eyes also you go into the Collective on the Supra-conscious and you can see. You’ll be amazed, people who take LSD, they cannot see Me, they just see light. They do not see Me. They just see light.

Sahaja Yogi: Astral bodies.
Shri Mataji: That is absolutely bhoot. Astral body is a ‘bhoot-vidya’ (Ghostology). That too is bhoot(Evil spirit). Absolutely bhoot. This, the levitation is bhoot. All this is bhoot. Are dead spirits. Astral body is, it’s a very funny thing, why can’t you understand? It’s very simple. How God is interested in making you astral? But people are really mad after it, I tell you. From America, three big scientists came to see Me and they said, “You make us fly in the air.” [Laughter] They all know about it. So, I told them, “Why do you want to fly in the air, you are already flying up to the moon?” But they said, “No, no, we want to do it.” And when I asked them that, “Why are you so insistent, you’ll become a slave of those bhoots and things”, so they said, “No, no, Mother, still you must do it for us.” I said, “Why?” “Because” they said, “Russia is doing like this, so we should also do it.” So these are mad people. If they are doing at national level, what am I to do? They are all going into the ‘bhoot-vidya’. They should not! That’s a very funny thing, you know!
And, who told them to come to Me is the man who suffered from this disease and I cured him. Imagine that fellow should tell him that I should give some bhoots! It’s a very wrong thing. Levitation, all this is bhoot-vidya.
You see, removing matter from here and there is not God’s concern at all! He only moves their Kundalini, that’s all!

Sahaja Yogi: Mother, does it help you in your particular professional field in the world? Or does it mean that any person who reaches a certain state (Hindi) eventually becomes an ascetic or something like that?
Shri Mataji: No, no, no. Not at all! No, no, no, no, no. No way. Asceticism is not for Sahaja Yogis. You should lead a very normal married life. Absolutely nothing like that.
Now in professional field or say in material field or whatever you call, it is so important at this stage because your priorities are different, you see but they will change gradually. But when these priorities are also there, I can tell you, definitely materially also you improve because – yogakshema vahamyaham (The phrase "Yogakṣemaṁ vahāmyaham" (योगक्षेमं वहाम्यहम्) originates from the Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 9, Verse 22. In this verse, Lord Krishna assures that for those who are exclusively devoted to Him, He personally takes responsibility for their well-being.) That promise is fulfilled. (Inaudible sounds) Yogakshema-vahamyaham: ‘yoga’ means ‘the meeting with God’. Once it happens, that union, that plus after that is ‘shema’, is ‘wellbeing’. “Both I’ll look after” says Shri Krishna in Gita. All right? But first should be ‘yoga‘.
Now questions are over?

Sahaja Yogi: How can you recognise that a person is ...(inaudible sound)?
Shri Mataji: Very easy because you can see it from the vibrations. You are a Realised soul, now you have got vibrations, very easy, you can make out a person from his vibrations. If a person is a bad soul, you won’t even stand near that person. You’ll feel that ants are coming. Some people are like scorpion. You stand near them, you feel there’s scorpion coming out of them. So, you will make it out, not difficult, after Realisation.

Sahaja Yogi: We in India being religious people have some concept of Kundalini. How do these in medical sciences have this concept? Do they recognise it?
Shri Mataji: Medical ... [medical science]? They have no eyes beta [my child] to see, they have to go into meditation. I have told these people, “You go and talk to these doctors.” I have given three lectures there. They want me to give another lecture. I’m fed up of giving lectures. I’m saying, “Why don’t you take your Realisation and understand it?”
Now we have two doctors here, who have come. One is a Russian and another is an Indian, who is practicing in London. And they say that, “After knowing these subtle centres and all that, then we know that what are the, what these centres are, managing are the gross things. Once you know how to handle the centres, you can manage whole thing.” But they don’t want to listen to Me. Only one condition, of course I put, that when you learn Sahaja Yoga you cannot charge money for curing. That maybe the thing! I don’t know.
It has absolute relevance with your medical sciences. Science is nothing but a little part of what I’m telling you.

Sahaja Yogi: ....... Practice of Hatha Yoga and even as a mere system of exercise after Realisation?
Shri Mataji: Exercises are no good, of this kind. You see, you must understand the science of Hatha Yoga. Hatha Yoga is Ashtanga Yoga(Eight stages of yoga as preached by Sage Patanjal about two thousand years back), which is to be practiced before marriage, in a forest, with a guru. Gradually, you see, you are cleansed and the guru is a Realised soul, who looks after you and gradually he does all that.
Now, I would say ‘yoga’ is only Sahaja Yoga. The rest of them are preparations.
Yoga is the way where you meet(with God), is the Maha Yoga. Where you ‘meet’ is the Yoga. The rest of it is, supposing you have to come to Delhi, till you have not reached Delhi, (you are)one mile away, you are not in Delhi. So, you can come by a bullock cart, you can come by a jet plane or you can come by such a thing that just shoots off. If somebody can do that, that is better than to do this slow movement.
In Hatha Yoga, Ashtanga Yoga is there and gradually you see, they are all human beings, and they work it out in such a manner that every chakra is cleansed gradually and a person is put to it. And, he has to lead an ascetic life, before marriage, he has to do all these things and is a very difficult thing.
But if you say that asanas [yogic postures prescribed by sage Patanjal as one of the eight stages], I’m definitely against it because you must know what asana is to be done.
We also use asanas in Sahaja Yoga but only whatever is required. Now if your throat is not all right why should you do stomach exercise? Means your throat will be bad in any case and stomach will also go out.

Hatha Yoga, Hatha Yogis are rather difficult for Realisation, I must say. Those who do these exercises are rather difficult. They are! I mean, that’s a fact! Because all these things are not to be done, like Raja Yoga also not to be done. It is a spontaneous happening. Everything works out inside. As I told you that a car which has not yet started, no use moving it’s wheels or anything.
Sahaja Yoga encompasses all these yogas because by this your spontaneous happening takes place. Now, it could be that I cleanse you completely, sit down for hours together, cleanse you first and then raise the Kundalini. Another way would be just to raise your Kundalini, enlighten you and then you cleanse yourself.
But the way people are doing Hatha Yoga, I’m against(it), absolutely. Because they just do not know what to do. They do all the chakras – only thing you can do is thin down, at the most with that. Other things, I do not know what is the advantage because you get, I’ve seen people, Hatha Yogis are always having heart(catching on heart chakra) and they become very dry people. For somebody who’s (doing) a Hatha Yoga, I’m sure his wife must be having a terrible time with him. He becomes a very dry person, very hot tempered. We have had people like that, you know them, Vishwamitra(One of the most venerated sages of ancient India) got after Harish Chandra(An honest noble king of ancient India); Durvasa(Legendary sage, known for his temper); they just give you sharp eyes.

These people are not going to do any ‘kalyan’(benevolence). They have no love, nothing, very dry because you go to the right-hand side. Surya Namaskaras(Sun salutation,sequence of 12 yogic postures) – another thing. If you overdo it, you can become a very dry person. Extremely dry! I mean such bores they are! You just can’t talk to them for more than five minutes. And if you sit there for the sixth minute, they may hit you hard. [Laughter]

Mostly they have divorces and things like that. Very dry! They never smile. They do not believe in smiling, laughing. They are not open hearted. These are the ‘doshas’ (doshas are the three fundamental energies—Vata, Pitta, and Kapha—that govern physiological and psychological functions in the body. They are derived from the five elements: ether, air, fire, water, and earth). But emotional side we do not see. We just want health. What’s the use of having so called health, which is full of such a mind, which doesn’t even smile, doesn’t have any reception for others. Horrible personality. I mean, I have seen so many ‘pahalwans’ (wrestlers) who come to Me and say, “Mother give us peace.” Such people can be horrid. Absolutely horrid people!
