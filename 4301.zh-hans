Christmas Puja, Ganapatipule (India), 25 December 2000

[Shri Mataji speaks first in Hindi for about sixteen minutes]
[Scanned from Divine Cool Breeze - Translation from Hindi to English]

The reason for celeberaling this auspicious day is the birth of the Christ. Very little is known about Jesus Christ because in young age he left his house and after returning he lived only up to the age of thirty year But dunng this short period he did tremendous work After his death, his twelve disciples spread Christianity. They also faced problems as you have to face sometimes But these twelve disciples did tremendous work. Their followers. In the beginning, were known as Gnostics, meaning 'Those who have known' The origin of this word is from 'Gna' meaning To Know' These people were harassed and tortured by the priests of that time So in the beginning it was very difficult to convince people of Christ s thoughts People were not seif realised Jesus Christ had said it again and again 'Know Thyself. 'Know Thyself Without realising the significance of self realisation people started spreading the religion. Without knowing the Self, religion could not be spread because gradually such religion becomes Adharmas Same thing happened with Christian religion It is written that Jesus Chnst went to a wedding party There he put his finger in the water and converted it tn to wine It is written in Hebrew language that
the taste of this water changed in to that of the wine. 'Wine' in Hebrew Christian people twisted the meaning of the wine and took it for alcohol and Christians took to alcohol and accepted It in their religion Alcohol is Iho cause of all Adharma. ail sins It gives human beings distracted attention Its very easy to change the taste of the water I may also do it by putting my hand m it. But people took so much to alcohol that I am astonished! In England, I saw, they dunk alcohol Whether some one is born or dies, you go to someone's house immediately they offer you drink Without drinking they do not know how to talk to you Alcohol is so much prevalent But it will be injustice to say that Jesus Chnst advocated the dunking of Alcohol. None of the incarnations could tell to go against religion In India also tne use of alcohol has become prevalent. When we were young during the time of British rule, Indians were not used to drinking May be that alcohol was consumed by some highly placed people, otherwise it was not used. Now even common men could be seen annking. No one thinks of the miserable state alcohol drags the person in. Orunkards. then commit sins. moaning the juice of the grapes Bui Christian people twisted the meaning of the wine and took it for alcohol and Christians took to alcohol and accepted It in their religion Alcohol is Iho cause of all Adharma. ail sins It gives human beings distracted attention Its very easy to change the taste of the water I may also do it by putting my hand m it.

Orunkards. then commit sms.The first thing I want to tell you rs that the drinking by the Christians is not a religious activity Alcohol is made in the Church of Rome To commit sins (Adharma) in the name of religion (Dharma)l It is unpardonable s*n That ts how people accept all the evils
The aim ot Jesus Christ was to open the centre ol your Agnya and to achieve that purpose He got Himself crucified and then He resurrected. It appears to be a miracle but for the Divinity there t$ no miracle as such. He proved that human beings could rise above the centre of Agnya and on this centre he told two mantras which we call Beei Mantras - Ham and Ksham' Ksham' means to forgive. Ksham is the biggest mantra The ego of the person who knows how to forgive, gets destroyed One is proud of $mall»smalt things. For example if you toil someone to sit on the earth, Ns ego gets hurt If some one is told to sit m the chair he will reply. This chair is very small, why have you given it to me7’ Everyone has some expectation about him and if his expectations are not fulfilled, his ego immediately comes up. Unknowingly some times such things could be done but the egoistical people take it as their insult Such people make their condition very miserable All the time they think they are being insulted and humiliated He is always obsessed with this thought and he draws negative meaning of whatever is told to him So we have to think ol what Jesus Christ had ihought He said. ’Forgive those who have tress passed against you’ Now see the results if you forgive everyone You will neither suffer nor get disturbed mentaly. You will not think of the person whom you have forgiven Nothing could go against you because you forgive everyone We get this power from the centre of Agnya. The person whose Agnya is clear forgives everyone If we donot forgive we torture ourselves and play rn the hands of others, who assume power over us 'Forgiveness' ts the greatest message that Jesus Christ has given to mankind.
Second is 'Ham' It has altogether different meaning. Ham means To Know Thyself.' You have to know that you aro the Spirit. You are not this body. mind, bram or ego You are the Spin! When you know this 'Ham' then it will be clear to you that you are the Atma The 'Spirit' means that alt the ego. foolishness, ignorance that we have m our mind, are meaningless At) these negativities have absolutely no place in the Pure Spint You are very pure,
So he told two things, the first is To Forgive everyone Knowingly or unknowingly if someone troubles you, you should forgive him You will not get tortured but if you donot forgive then you torture yourself because another person *s sitting nicely. So you must develop the habit of forgiveness
Second thing that he told us is that 'You are the Spirit1 Know this Spirit, the Self No one can touch the spmt. can destroy it. no one can torture it. If you are that spirit then you should be established in it But to achieve this Atm- Tattva the awakaning of Kundalini is necessary First »s to work out the awakening of the Kundahm and then to get established in it Untiil you are established you will remain entangled in stupidies So one should know how to be established with in. to remain with in thyself. When you achieve this state, you will feel the extreme joy within and nothing will disturb you When you get established in this aura of peace, then you will be surprised, you wont worry about small small things You will be always drenched in the joy of Spin!
To attain the Spmt. the awakening of kundaltni is essential, Without attaining awakening this is impossible But some of the awakened people also get confused They do not go in depth The central point is your Agnya If you look at it then you will come to know that it is contusing you. Because of it you are entangled, caught in different thoughts and having different problems But when you cross this centre of Agnya and go beyond it then this problem will be over That is why this centre is very significant It is written in the Bible that those who apply vermillion on their forehead will be saved They could be none else but Sahaia Yogis Its a stupendous task Jesus Chnst had only twelve disciples but you are thousands and thousands Had you put one thousandth labour that they pul. the spreading of Sahaja Yoga would have been much more. I depend upon you people You are my sole support and I hope you will spread Sahaja Yoga in the whole world

很抱歉我要说印度话,因为大部份在这里的人,只明白印度语。当我在国外时,我常常说英语,只说英语,所以现在我想作一点改变。
有关耶稣基督的伟大的降生,我告诉他们祂是怀着非常伟大的使命而降生,可以说是其中一个最伟大的使命,因为祂想开启非常压迫的额轮,这是从未有人做过的。为此祂必须牺牲祂的生命,只有牺牲祂的生命,额轮才可以开启。祂是完全明白并知道这是将会发生——祂要接受这牺牲。正如我们所知,祂是神性的人性。祂这样做是完全没有问题,但祂想或许有其他途径去开启这额轮。
祂是要牺牲祂的生命。在这牺牲,祂显示若你要超越世俗、表面的生命,便需作某程度的牺牲。牺牲什么呢?牺牲你的六个敌人。当灵量被唤醒,你对所有这六个敌人便完全不会执着; 这全頼你的灵量是怎样提升,如果它提升得很完美,我会看到人们是立即得到自觉──他们变成完全醒觉的人。当然这类人是小数,但这里有一些。
当我见到你们大部分人只有很小问题,你们大多数的问题都是来自额轮。我们就是这样消耗额轮──我们以「思维」作为对外在每事每物的反应,我们对外在的每样事物都作出反应。我看到在这里的灯,我可以有这样的反应:「他们怎样找到这些灯? 这些灯值多少钱?他们怎样全年保存这些灯?」......所有类似的东西,我都可以作出反应。这些反应都是来自我们的思想制约或我们的自我(我执)。
自我膨胀的人都极之敏感。如果你给予他们某些他们认为不尊重他们的东西,他们会感到受伤害。他们可以因为任何事物而感到受伤害,因为他们认为他们是特别的,比别人层次高。别人与他们相处时,言行要检点。这就是为什么当别人看不起他们时,他们会感到非常困扰。这是来自自我。自我是额轮活动的不可分割的一部分。另一个原因是你的社会制约。现在你有某些制约,如你是印度人──你的制约是当别人来见你时,他要触摸你的脚──假若这是代表你和他的关系──若这人不触摸你的脚,你便会生气。所有有关这样的事情都是来自你的思想制约,令你感到受辱,或感到别人不尊重你,令你感到不安。自我的另一种反应是这样,如我上述所说的灯,我可以说:「为什么我不也拥有一些灯?」或「如我有这些灯,我为什么要给别人?」。自我就是这样反应或制约就是这样作出反应。
自我与制约将会消失,因为耶稣基督牺牲了祂的生命。耶稣是神圣的人,神圣的人就像海洋一样,保持在零点,在最低点。祂就在这一点成就事情,祂可以制造云,制造雨,当所有河流水涨时,它们都会流入大海,因为大海仍然保持在零点。
所以谦卑是霎哈嘉瑜伽士的其中一种特性,并不谦卑的人不能称为霎哈嘉瑜伽士。我曾见过有些霎哈嘉瑜伽练习者也能很愤怒,他们有时也会叫喊、非常愤怒及行为失当,这就是他们不是霎哈嘉瑜伽士的征兆,他们仍需要变得成熟。
这种谦卑令你变得平静,我可以说这是令你保持同一状态而不会对外在的事物作出反应的原因,你不会作出反应。你看到每事每物──你反应,跟着你便不作反应,你只是静观,新的旁观见证状态就这样出现,当你变成旁观者,你只是静观,不会作出反应,不会想及它,你是处身现在──在这现在,你只静观,静观及享受一切。享受创造的一切并不能从你的思维中可以得到。当你不作思考时,创造的美丽就在你身上反映,给予你极大的喜乐及平和。
所以我们要学习不要作出反应,现今人类的问题是太懂得反应,反应是生活中的基本原则。看报纸、看书、与某人会面,我发觉他们都是反应的专家,他们都反应。对每事每物作出反应令他们不能成就事情最精华的部份,事情的精粹只能通过旁观见证的状态才能成就,这就是我们从耶稣基督被钉十字架中所能学习到的。从祂的出生──祂出生在很谦卑,很贫穷的家庭,生活条件很恶劣。所有这些都是向你们展示所有外在的环境,外在的荣耀都不能令你变得伟大──伟大是源自内在。当这伟大在内里存在时,你是不会关心其他事物,因为你内里已经满足,其他事物不会骚扰你,你不会想及其他事物,你活在你的尊贵中。这就是我们从耶稣基督的一生中看到的,祂是很尊贵的人。否则当你遇见很可怜的人,例如他感觉到权力,他会以像乞丐一样的态度与你说话。例如在很富裕家庭出生的人,他会以很炫耀的态度与你说话。但神性的人,所有这些都不会令他动容。对他来说,有钱没钱,有地位没有地位,全都是一样,当这种情形发生,你可以认为你已变成霎哈嘉瑜伽士。
我曽经见过来到格纳帕提普蕾的人,现在他们都很成熟,否则他们都会说 :「我们没有水,我们没有这些设施,这里很冷,很热......或其他。」他们常常提及这些,像他们在度假,这里有很大分别,你要在这里发展你的旁观见证能力。你有没有看到这天空,它是多么美丽?橙色、蓝色、各种各样的颜色也在那里。这颜色──自然的出现,享受着。它是不受任何影响而永远存在,它会在黑暗中消失,只是看着,天空只静静的看着。任何事情发生,它都接受,所以它才这样美丽,给予别人无限的喜乐。
所以当你处于灵性的状态,你是令人喜乐,你是平和,你是很有爱心及爱每一个人。所有自我的问题都会消失。自我是你的最大敌人,它是唯一真正阻碍你生命中的财富及美丽,所以若你能看到这自我,看到它是怎様运作,你只是享受它。像一出戏剧上演,「好吧?让我们拥有它。」你会像看戏一样,怱然很奇妙地发觉你并不身在其中,你只是看着它。当你从自我抽身而出,你会看到它是怎样尝试诱惑你。
这就是现今的问题,这就是为什么我们这样需要耶稣基督,现今的问题是人们并不知道他们变得自我之后,对他们自己,对别人及对全世界作出多大的伤害。如果你能知道,我告诉你,他们会放弃自我。问题是他们享受这些,他们享受这种自私或我可以说是非常低层次的生活。当你们都是霎哈嘉瑜伽练习者,你们要做的是要明白「为什么这自我会在我脑海中出现?我做了些什么?我又是谁?」当你发问这些问题,你的自我便会消失。
对我来说,处理有自我的人是很大的问题,因为我不能直接告诉他们 :「你有自我。」如果我这样告诉他们,他们会跑掉。如果我告诉他们 :「你非常好,非常令人喜悦。」那么他们的自我便会膨胀。他们会说 :「 啊!母亲告诉我,我令人愉快。」 这是很有问题。我不知道怎样处理人类的自我,我知道他们有这问题,但我不知道怎样处理,我想只有你能处理,如果你能明白你的问题,这是解决你和我的问题的最佳途径。
我要达成的目标对一世来说是太伟大了,我希望成就全宇宙得到自觉,我希望全世界人都得到自觉,这是非常卓越的要怎样...... (台下鼓掌)
在霎哈嘉瑜伽文化中,我们有正统的训练怎样清除自我,你可以通过内省,你能看清你自己为何会作出这样的言行,这内省只有霎哈嘉瑜伽士能做而不能别人代劳,因为只有他们自己可以进入自己内里,以看清自己,他们可静观别人,他们可尝试看看这「自我先生」在我脑海中正在做些什么?当然我们知道背诵耶稣基督的口诀能清除所有自我的问题,有很大的帮助。当你念诵口诀时,你必须以很谦虚的态度。「我是什么,除此之外,我是谁?」看看天上很多的星星,看看身边很多美丽的事物,我又是谁呢?我有什么成就?为什么我要这样自我中心?为什么我认为自己是很伟大?」
还有别人对你阿谀奉承,因为他们想在你身上得到好处,所以他们奉承你,他们会说 :「这是很伟大,你是很伟大。」他们完全迷惑你,令你迷失了方向。就像倾盆大雨冲走你,令你淹没在充满自我的人群的洪流中。你今天看看四周,在现今的世代,每一个人都意识到他们的自我,对自我很有意识,他们以怎样的态度在报纸上出现,怎样在杂志上出现,我感到很惊奇。若我在那里,会感到很羞耻,这全都是自我的表现──没有其他。所有各种他们开展的事情,都是与自我竞争,很多的竞争,像他们很漂亮的竞争,跟着他们再与某先生竞争──你可以说是在印度,某东西先生......所有这些东西都助长这个人的自我,其他东西亦追逐这竞争。他们想:「为什么我不......我应该像这样」。
这些都令你麻木,并絶对蒙蔽你的思维,令你以为这样就是「成功」。 但这成功能持续多久?它随时都会消失,但在霎哈嘉瑜伽中成功是可以持续至永远,及被每个人都记着。那些人有这种谦卑的性格会被一代一代的记着。我未曾见过任何一位被立铸像的人是自我很大的。相反地,若某人常常批评别人,他是个很自我的人。现在这是没可能。若某人有自我,我想没有人会为他唱歌,或以他的名字为他立碑。
在内心深处,我们都喜欢谦卑的人,如果我们想别人喜欢我们,我们必须非常谦卑,不是做作,真正的谦卑,若我们明白「我们是什么? 为什么我们要这样骄傲?为什么我们要控制或找别人麻烦?」若你能明白,你对伟大的耶稣基督的降世作出正面的评价,他性格上有很多特质。对我们来说,他最好的特质是祂因牺牲祂的生命而令我们通过自我,这是最伟大的信息。因此,我们要明白只想及自己的人,是自我最大的人,我很惊奇在英国,英国人是极之自我,其他我见过的西方国家也一样,他们都很自我,他们完全不谦虚。与印度人比较,他们是非常非常的自我。为什么?因为他们都是跟随耶稣基督。你可以想象!我们是不是这样跟随耶稣基督?自称基督徒的人,自称耶稣基督仰慕者的人,都应该在他们的言行中显示这种谦卑、慈悲和爱心,但他们并不。
所以,特别从西方国家来的人,要尝试学习霎哈嘉文化,在霎哈嘉文化中,我们怎样说话,怎样生活,怎样与别人相处,都是与别不同。当你在生活中开展霎哈嘉文化,你会非常惊奇,别人也会很惊奇,你是怎样能与别人融洽相处,你是怎能妥善照顾每事每物。成为霎哈嘉瑜伽士是在这世界中最理想的生活方式,这里没有自我,没有思想制约,什么也没有,你是絶对在这些质量中解放出来。你会惊奇别人是这样信任你,喜欢你。
我希望你们都有很快乐的圣誔节并能记着耶稣基督及祂的生命所带给你们的信息。
愿神祝福你们。
