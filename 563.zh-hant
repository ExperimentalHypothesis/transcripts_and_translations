寬恕輪 Agnya Chakra

1983年2月3日 印度德里

今天我們要了解寬恕輪,這個輪穴在視神經交叉的位置。眼部神經在後面相反方向交叉,那交叉的位置便是寬恕輪的所在。通過延髓,寬恕輪與其他中心有著連繫。寬恕輪有兩塊花瓣。這個微妙的中心在前面作用於眼睛,在後面作用於腦後突出的部位。這便是此輪穴身體方面的特性。有些人說人有第三眼,寬恕輪便是第三眼。我們有兩隻眼睛,能夠看見事物,同時我們還有此微妙的第三眼。如果你看見這隻眼睛,那表示你其實離開了它。例如,如果你看見自己的眼睛,那表示你是看見鏡中的反映,不是真實。如果你看見甚麼,那表示你是在觀看它。因此有些人吃了迷幻藥,說看見另一隻眼。他們只是看見,但卻以為自己的第三眼已經打開了。其實你是離開很遠的,此所以你能夠看見它。你要麼跑到右邊的超意識去,要麼跑到左邊的潛意識去,都能看見那第三眼。但在霎哈嘉瑜伽,你卻是通過那第三眼來觀看。就好像一個窗戶,你可以看見那個窗戶,但如果你通過那個窗戶去觀看,你便看不見那窗戶。因此有些人說看見第三眼,以為靈量已經昇起來了,他們其實是大錯特錯。

寬恕輪是個狹窄的通道,一般情況下注意力不能通過,一般情況下,那是沒有可能的。那通道很狹窄,因為「自我」和「超我」互相接合,封閉了通道,於是沒有空隙可容靈量通過。超我與自我下面是喉輪,自喉輪一直繞上來。因此你們看見自我和超我在這個位置。它們由喉輪開始,一直到達寬恕輪的位置,然後交叉。因此你們左邊有問題,會表現在右邊。右手從這裡開始直達這邊,左手則從這裡開始。但左手其實作用於右邊。

因此我們要通過或進入那第三眼,這要靠提昇靈量才能做到。但這個到達大腦邊緣系統,即天國的門戶,是很狹窄的。因此如果有人強把注意力進入那封閉的門戶,他不是去了左邊,便是右邊。這樣便引生許多麻煩,因為那些人不知道,那些不可知的領域不是屬神的。因此當他們移向右邊,便進入了超意識界,開始看見幻象。其實那些都不是幻象,而是存在於右邊的真實事物,那些人其實是看見屬於右邊的事物。他們可能看見色彩,可能看見死去的人物,特別是那些自我很強的人物,他們能看見乾闥婆(Gandharwas)和緊那羅(Kinnaras),因為他們進入了右邊的乾闥婆界,開始看見超意識界中的事物。但這樣做是很危險的,因為如果那裡有誰逮住你,便有一個附加人格坐在你頭上,你在自我處被附了身,變得自以為是,行為惡毒。希特勒便是一個例子,他跟隨西藏的喇嘛學習如何進入超意識界,學會了以後便使無數的人變得自我中心,同時進入超意識界。你們也許也聽說過那些喇嘛,他們能夠知道未來,例如誰是下一任的喇嘛,到那裡去找他等等。他們知道許多未來的事情,人們便以為是屬於上天的。知道未來不是屬於上天的。那是我們不應進入的領域,因為那表示不平衡。我們是人類,我們要知道「現在」,不是「將來」。一旦你們通過現在這個階段,便能上昇至一個高度,可以看見過去、現在和將來。就好像在大地上,如果你能找到一個高處,你便能看見已走過的,和要來到的,這樣你便能在現在之中。同樣,如果一個人在現實中昇進,到達超越的意識,他便能看見右邊的超意識和左邊的潛意識,但他會對兩者都沒有興趣,他只希望在現在之中昇進,這其實便是提昇靈量所要做的。

因此所有那些說提昇靈量是很難很危險的,他們都是沒有獲得授權去提昇靈量的人。他們只是弄些甚麼把戲,刺激交感神經系統,使左右交感神經從中脈抽取能量,造成中脈衰竭,而使那個人的精神系統破壞。因此那些說以這個方法那個方法提昇靈量的人,其實是扼殺了求道者的生命。最後那些求道者會一無所得。沒有人知道可以得到甚麼,因為他們被帶入了歧途。

但邏輯上我們應該了解,練習以後,至低限度我們的健康要良好,精神應比從前更好才對,同時你們的脾性要有所改善,這是最低限度的。但如果你的錢全都給導師拿去,追求那些無意義的經驗,結果損害了健康,甚至不能主宰自己,那你們應該知道,這些都不是真實。在真實之中,你應該能夠主宰自己。如果你被別的東西控制,那你便是迷失了。例如,有些人不停的跳。他們說:「母親,我不停自動的跳。」這情況其實很嚴重,那表示你不能控制自己,那是有別人在你裡面使你不停的跳。那不是「你」在跳。你的注意力和意識都在別人控制之下,以致不能控制自己。所以所有那些空中飛行或靈界旅行,看見種種事物等,都是非常危險的,這個人最後可能會進入精神病院,因為他完全不能控制自己。

在美國,他們稱這些為超心理學(para-psychology)的實驗。當然這些是超越個人的心靈的,但卻十分危險。你們不應走進那個領域,要是有甚麼亡靈逮住你,你便行為怪異。大概十二年前,有一些美國人來見我,說:「母親,請教我們如何在空中飛行。」我說:「為甚麼?你們不是有飛機了麼?」他們說:「不,我們要在空中飛行。」我說為甚麼?他們說:「因為俄國正做那些超心理學的實驗,我們也要照樣做。」我說那些人會被亡靈附體,結束自己。我說我不會教這些東西。如果那些俄國人來見我,我也會這樣說。但那些美國人還是說:「不,我們還是要學。」我說,如果我告訴你,你便會變成那些亡靈的奴隸,不停的抖顫。儘管如此,他們還是說:「即使這樣,我們還是要學。」他們說俄國人做的,他們也要做。最後我問誰介紹他們來的,他們說了一位先生的名字,他是孟買的一名記者。我告訴他們這位先生從前正是患上我剛才所說的問題。他經常離開身體,進入另一個世界,東看西看,最後他完全不能主宰自己,後來我治好了他。但他竟然以為我既然能治,就一定能令人進入那個狀態。我治好他的病,為甚麼你們卻要得到他的病,他們執意如此。最後我才發現,他們在美國開有利用超心理學賺錢的生意,這是極端危險的事情。

這是因為運動的方向不是通過寬恕輪,而是移向左邊或右邊,即潛意識和超意識。其後果可能不同,但在霎哈嘉看來,都是一樣的。那些進入潛意識界的人可能看見我別的形相,好像那些吃迷幻藥的不能看見我,只看見光。而那些進入潛意識的,他們會看見一些形相和事情,他們以為是到達了天國,其實他看見的是進化過程中的過去,那是過去的一切。因此超意識界和潛意識界都是十分危險的。因為如果注意力移向左邊,便會產生癌症那類不治之症。因此要小心,不要到那些術師那裡去,他們會控制你,或告訴你一些關於過去或未來的事物。

我們毋須知道過去或未來,有甚麼需要知道呢?知道了有甚麼作用呢?好像我告訴你我是怎樣來到會場的,途中有交通阻塞等等,你會有興趣聽麼?你們為何會對過去有興趣?那對今天甚麼價值也沒有。可是那是人類的一個弱點,他們總要在自己的人格上附加上一些極端人為,並不真正存在,或是毫無價值的東西,然後說,我能做這,能做那。

在印度一般人都走向寬恕輪左邊,因為他崇拜神。他們要崇拜神,但卻與神沒有聯繫。就好像我沒有連接這個麥克風,便不能向你們說話一樣。但他們沒有聯繫,卻去崇拜神,唱各種崇拜歌,行禁食,折磨自己。他們是走向左邊的人,愛高唱讚歌等等,甚至二十四小時不停。這樣,亡靈便把他們吸向左邊。

又如他們不斷唸誦羅摩的口訣。也許你們說蟻蛭仙人(Valmiki)就是這樣唸誦的,但是誰叫他這樣的?是Narada。Narada是降世神祇。你們自己或任何人可以教別人這樣誦神的名字嗎?無論你們唸甚麼名字,都不能達到神。你們到了那裡?你們會到了另外某處,那裡可能有個僕人叫羅摩,於是他便會逮住你,而你會變得行為怪異,像個瘋癲的人。

至於超意識那邊,有些野心很大的人,他們陷入瘋狂,毫不考慮集體,只想到自己。出了問題時,我們也很難說服那些受害者,讓他們知道走錯了路,直到他們徹底完結為止。

寬恕輪是天國的門戶,是每個人都要通過的。耶穌基督便是在這個輪穴之上。在印度的經典中,祂叫摩訶毗濕奴(Mahavishnu),是羅陀(Radha)之子。祂的本質是由十一個毀滅力量(Ekadasha Rudrus)構成。但最主要的本質卻是格涅沙的純真。因此祂是純真的化身。純真的意思是完全的純潔。祂的身體不是由大地之母造的,因此祂的身體不會毀壞,祂是唵(Omkara),因此祂死後能夠復活。祂是羅陀之子,你們很容易便能看見祂和其他神祇的關係,在Devi Bhagvat一書,便有摩訶毗濕奴的記載。

可是誰會讀這本書呢,沒有人有時間讀這本書。他們只讀那些沒有用的書,讀那些書,你們不能找到關於降世神祇的知識。因此要明白耶穌基督,你們要讀Devi Bhagvat。可是如果我們向基督徒這樣說,他們根本不會聽,因為對他們來說,聖經是最後的根據。這怎麼可能呢?因為聖經中所記載的,只是耶穌一生中的四年。在其他書中,也應該是有提到祂的。因此我們要張開眼睛看那些書,然後自己去判斷那是否真理。但他們欲成立有組織宗教,所以他們說:「只是這樣。」沒有其他。因為如果有其他,他們的組織便會瓦解。可是事實不如他們所想那樣。

因為Devi Bhagvat一書曾清楚地描述耶穌。靈量可以幫助我們證明這點。當靈量昇起,停在寬恕輪,你們要唸誦主禱文,否則寬恕輪便不會打開。你們要喚醒耶穌基督,否則便不會打開。你們要唸誦祂的名字,否則寬恕輪不會打開,這證明耶穌基督是主宰這個輪穴的。甚至你們唸誦摩訶毗濕奴的名字,寬恕輪也會打開。因此你們要正視這些證據。只是你們想擁有耶穌基督,才會否定他人,視他人為異端。你們是大錯特錯了。

每一部經典都有人去竄改它。每一部經典都是這樣。我可以告訴你們薄伽梵歌的情況,他們把錯誤的飲食觀念放進去,那是與科學違反的。說傾向答摩的人是吃肉的,那根本不對。因為吃蛋白質的人應自動變成傾向剌闍的人才對。因此這部分是人們根據他們的需要改動過的。但開頭的部分沒有改動。在開頭部分,克里希納說:「是你殺那些人嗎?其實我已經把他們殺了,你還可以殺誰?」是那些婆羅門把經文改掉的。

至於在聖經,錯誤由保羅開始。保羅這人和耶穌沒有任何關係,但卻進入了聖經。我不明白為何保羅會在聖經之中。他只是個傾向超意識的羅馬士兵,而且是個很壞的士兵,曾殺害過許多基督徒。但忽然間人們把保羅當作聖徒列入聖經,而且為世界各地接受,但如果你讀他寫的章節,便會知道他根本不是個得到自覺的靈。他是從超意識說話的,他是一副組織機器,一無是處。使徒行傳是他寫的,在使徒行傳,保羅把耶穌的門徒描繪成像被鬼附的人那般,完全是傾向於超意識的人,他們行為怪異,以致被視為癲狂。你們可想像耶穌的門徒是這樣的嗎?但如果你是基督徒,卻須把這一切生吞活剝,因為那是在聖經之中的。但如果你是個天生自覺的靈,便會懷疑這些廢話。你會問:「誰是這個保羅?他是從那裡跑出來的?」因為保羅所說的和耶穌基督所說的不同。

現在時候已經來臨了,我們要知道所有宗教都是同一的。所有宗教都是同一生命河流的部分。所有那些降世神祇都是互相支持,互相滋養,互相照顧的。祂們之間完全合拍。你不可能看見祂們互相反對。當然這一點也是要證明的。只有提昇靈量,我們才能證明這一點。如果你是得到自覺的靈,同時能提昇別人的靈量,你會驚奇所有的神祇都在我們不同輪穴之中,我們要逐一喚醒他們。有時候,我在印度談耶穌基督時,人們便譴責我,說我在傳播基督教。但如果我在英國談克里希納,人們便譴責我傳播印度教。現在我要告訴你們,是羅陀創造耶穌的。你們看耶穌,祂豎起兩隻手指[食指、中指],像這樣。一隻表示克里希納,一隻表示毗濕奴。耶穌曾說「天父」,那麼誰是耶穌的父親?是毗濕奴,即克里希納。因為經上是這樣描述摩訶毗濕奴的。經上說克里希納自己也崇拜他的兒子,並說:「你將成為宇宙的支持,同時無論誰崇拜我,崇拜之果都會到你那裡去」。克里希納把耶穌基督放得比自己還要高,你們也可以看見摩訶毗濕奴的輪穴在喉輪之上,祂是每個人都要通過的門戶。克里希納祝福自己的兒子,說:「你將成為宇宙的支持」。你們可以看見,格涅沙在根輪處,根輪的意思便是根和支持,可是耶穌基督卻被放在果實的支持和根部那裡,所以是同一力量在那處,並一路進化上來,當我們的寬恕輪打開了,便可以知覺到耶穌基督。

當靈量上昇,便會打開寬恕輪。但如果你過份自我取向,兩邊的汽球很緊迫,便甚麼也不能通過。又如果你傾向於超我,性格懦弱,易受宰制,使超我的氣球扭曲,寬恕輪也不能打開。我們要使它恢復平衡,從左邊移向右邊,或從右邊移向左邊。在得到自覺後,你們便能明白這些霎哈嘉瑜伽的技巧,現在是不能明白的。如果得到平衡,寬恕輪也會變得良好,沒有扭曲。這樣靈量上昇時才能通過。如果你是個正常的人,不傾向於自我或超我,那麼提昇靈量,通過寬恕輪是毫無問題的。我來到德里以後,從早到晚都要清理寬恕輪,這裡的人極端自我取向,他們全都以為自己是世界級的行政人員。德里是個寬恕輪很壞的地方,這裡有些很驕傲的人,充滿虛榮心,以為自己正在統治世界。那些行政人員和政客便是這類人,全都是自我取向。這類人很難給他們自覺,首先要降低他們的自我,他們要接受神才是至高無上的存有,是我們的主,是這個世界真正的王,這樣靈量才會上來。有些人的眼東張西望,以致損害了寬恕輪。耶穌曾經說:「聖典叫你們不要犯姦淫,我說你們不要有淫邪的眼睛。」看,耶穌特別提到眼睛,因為祂就在那個位置,控制著眼睛。可是在西方,很難找到一個男人或女人是沒有淫邪的眼睛的。他們都是基督的信徒,卻有這樣可怕的眼睛,真不知他們做過些甚麼,他們正走向瘋狂。他們無法固定他們的眼神,要時常的東張西望,左顧右盼。他們的眼睛很貪婪,要經常看這看那,但全然沒有喜樂,他們只是周圍去看人,卻全然沒有喜樂。

Translation from Hindi:

Let Me tell you in Hindi. One of My acquaintance had come, his wife was a simple person. When she came to London, she saw people’s eyes looking like this (seeing here and there/ roving eyes). So she asked, “What is happening?” I told, “This is known as flirting”. So she said, “Why do people do it?” I said, “People here do.” What do I tell her why do people do it? I don’t know why people do it. I said, “This person’s wife likes another person. That person’s husband like someone else, it goes on”. She asked, “It goes on even after marriage?” I told her, “It goes on till their death”. She was shocked, “I don’t understand. Our things belongs to us and others things belong to them. What is the fun?” I said, “You ask them”. And not one but everyone is like that. Even when Indians go there, they become like that.

Delhi is very bad in that matter. In Punjabi’s it is a special thing. It’s not there in Maharashtra. In Punjabis, they keep turning their head and looking at every woman till their neck breaks. Till then they will not stop. It is their specialty.

When I got married in Delhi, I saw. While I was studying in Lahore, it was even worse there.

This happened because of parda (veil) system.  Parda system increased people’s curiosity for women. Now there is no parda system, still this is going on. There is no feeling of mother and sister, very less. That’s why Christ has said, “Thou shall not have adulterous eyes”.

因此耶穌基督說:「你們不要有淫邪的眼睛。」耶穌基督給我們一條誡命,但沒有人遵守。就像在回教,穆罕默德叫人不要飲酒,於是Umar Khayaam便寫詩反對穆罕默德。現在基督徒也一樣,他們反對基督,作出各樣反基督的行為,完全破壞人的純真本性,完全破壞他們的眼睛,完全破壞所有思維的純潔。

同時他們走向另一個極端,那是耶穌基督從來沒有教導過的,卻不知如何在基督教中開始,他們要求信徒作教士及修女,過獨身的生活。其實這種不沾染的狀態是不能勉強的,那是一種「為而不為」(Avastha)的狀態,就像瑜伽之主克里希納那樣,是要靠昇進來達到的。克里希納有許多妻子,但祂還是像獨身一樣。這是種精神狀態,你完全不涉入事件之中。但如果你只是將那個獨身的意識強加於人,強迫他們過獨身的生活,那便完全是兩回事。耶穌基督從來沒有這樣說過。耶穌基督沒有結婚,因為祂來到世上是要成就一項偉大的工作,祂要打開寬恕輪,此所以祂要被釘上十字架。這樣,祂便在寬恕輪創造出一個空隙,這是祂奉天上父母之命做的。祂把這個使命完成了。但那些人卻開始那無意義的獨身主義,其實他們是沒有守身的,因為他們在思維中沒有。守身要從內在開始,純潔要來自內在。這種強迫的獨身為天主教帶來許多問題,同時他們開始向教士懺悔,那是另一樣荒謬的事情。就我所見,那些教士都不是得到自覺的靈。假如他是個自覺的靈,便一定逃跑,不當教士。但那些人卻要向這些教士懺悔,那些可憐的教士會變得瘋狂,而懺悔者會使喉輪左部阻塞,因為他有很大的罪疚感。這絕對是錯誤的,你們完全沒有需要感到罪疚。

耶穌降世以後,有許多人是不接受耶穌基督的,像猶太人便是這樣,他們不接受耶穌,並說:「我們必須受苦,我們要為神而受苦。」現在就算是基督徒也有認為需要受苦的。甚至印度人也相信必須受苦。但他們知道有摩訶毗濕奴,有一天祂會降世,吸去我們的罪業,這樣我們便不用再受苦。其實耶穌基督在你之內被喚醒以後,便會完成這項過程。祂會吸入你罪業,你的自我和超我,祂吸入你的業報和罪孽。可是那些來到印度的傳教士,一點都不知道摩訶毗濕奴,他們也不了解耶穌基督。他們一手拿槍,一手拿著聖經,而那些愚蠢的印度人,一點都不知道他們的文化遺產。他們說:「且讓我們成為基督徒,這樣他們便會給我們一份好職業。」於是那些職業取向的人全都成為基督徒。其實,我們應該告訴他們,摩訶毗濕奴已經降世。如果他們讀過Devi Bhagvat,且知道摩訶毗濕奴已經降世,那樣人們便會拋棄需要為過去的業行受苦的想法。現在的印度人還認為應該為過去的業行受苦,他們認為需要禁食,遊方,或把自己吊在樹上。這都是不需要的。你們要做的,是要等待寬恕輪打開的時刻。你們要持守中道,像佛陀教導的那樣。當靈量昇起以後,那些過去積集的都會被吸去,你便得到解脫。這是很簡單的。但許多印度人仍然相信我們必須受苦,必須禁食。

在霎哈嘉瑜伽,我們不許人以神的名禁食。你可以因為別的原因禁食,例如你沒有錢,便不得不禁食。但卻不可以神的名或為自己的「業」行禁食。就像那些猶太人,他們不接受耶穌基督,認為自己需要受苦,於是他們便苦難無窮,於是希特勒便令他們受盡痛苦,可是在逃離希特勒的魔掌以後,他們自己卻變成了希特勒。由此可見那些錯誤的觀念可以把你們帶到甚麼地步。那些猶太人這樣想,於是希特勒便出世來滿足他們的願望。

現在沒有任何人需要受苦了,你們要提昇靈量,在霎哈嘉瑜伽之中鞏固自己,你們的苦難都會統統去除。女神的一個名號是Papa Vimochini,即祂能去除你們的罪孽。格涅沙的一個名號是Sankat Vimochan,一切生命中艱難險阻的去除者。當你得到祝福的時候,便能明白神有許多方法祝福人類,好像是奇蹟一樣,絕對是奇蹟。許多人來到霎哈嘉瑜伽以後,說奇蹟這兩個字已失去了原來的意義,變成生活中慣見的事實。

因此我們要明白,神是存在的,不單存在,而且會作事,會愛,我們都要去認識神。無論你過去做過些甚麼,無論犯過甚麼錯誤,你們最後都要與神合一。因為祂是你們慈愛的父,祂是慈愛的海洋。你們唯一要做的,是要求得到。當靈量昇起,你們便能與神合一。你們的父要把祂的國度和權柄交與你們,因為你們都是由祂創造的。因此所有那些荒謬的宗教觀念,諸如你們要受苦,要行苦行,要獨身等等,都應統統拋棄。你們要成為快快樂樂的人。神為你們做了許多事,祂為你們創造了許多事物。但如果你要楚楚可憐,神能做些甚麼呢?

有時候如果你們要令母親不悅,你們會說:「......否則我便不吃飯。」此所以在霎哈嘉瑜伽不許禁食。但如果你們因某種原因要戒吃某類食品,那是可以的,否則便不要禁食。一年之中除了那一兩天特別的日子,你們可以禁食之外,其他日子都不要禁食。

現在我們已經明白,寬恕輪是最重要的門戶,每個人都要通過它,因此我們要適當地崇拜及清潔這個輪穴。我們的注意力要非常純潔,如果你的注意力有所污損,寬恕輪便不能良好。你會看見幻象,你會有錯誤的觀念,會思想那些錯誤的事情。因此如果你真的希望追求存在的意義,如果你真的希望提昇靈量,那便要知道,你過去對神及其他事物的了解都要修正,要自己重新發現,真實是怎樣的。除非你通過這個階段,否則便不能獲得真正的洗禮。

施洗約翰教人洗禮,他真是一個得到自覺的靈。他把水放在別人頭頂的時候,他真的提昇了靈量,讓那個人獲得自覺。這是真正的洗禮。基督徒的意思是個經過真正洗禮的人,不是任何張三李四把手放在你的頭上,憑空亂說,你便得到自覺。因此威廉‧布萊克說:「那教士在我的頭上詛咒。」真的,對於一個得到自覺的靈來說,如果那個教士不是得到自覺的靈,卻為人施洗,那麼受洗的兒童可能會發生問題。我們見過許多生下來便是自覺的兒童因此而產生問題。他們眼睛變成斜視,滑稽可笑,腦筋失靈,我們要去醫治他們。因此讓別人把手放在你頭頂腦囟的位置是很危險的,因為腦囟便是梵穴的所在,是人身中最重要的部位,因此每個人都要非常小心。要按這個部位,你必先是個得到自覺的靈,即霎哈嘉瑜伽修習者,同時知道正確的方法。因此你們的子女出生時你們要小心,如果他們是生下來便是自覺的靈,你們更要加倍小心。如果他們不是自覺的靈,反應不會那麼劇烈,但如果是自覺的靈,他們會大聲喊叫,因為他們無法忍受。

因此你們要明白,儘管有些事情很傳統,但如果對人類有害,我們還是要捨棄它。現在事候來臨了。如果你不能接受這一點。作為母親我只能說:「我是很關心你們的。」但事情其實還不只此,因為你們生長在一個很危險的時刻。

如果寬恕輪後部受破壞,那表示你已被亡靈附身。要是寬恕輪後部有阻塞,那個人會變成瞎眼,儘管他的眼睛能張開,卻看不見事物。在印度這是很普遍的。因為印度人有些可笑的觀念,說神或女神會進入人的身體。怎麼可能呢?這其實是超意識那邊的把戲。好像有個女傭,整天粗言穢語,不知清潔為何物,亦不知何謂神聖,但忽然間發出「呵,呵,呵」的聲音,她是被亡靈附了體。但在馬哈拉施特拉邦的女性卻會拜倒在她腳下,說:「女神來臨了,女神來臨了。」他們拜倒在她的腳下,結果全部都被亡靈附了身。我們最近看見一個很嚴重的病例,有個男子來見我,說他不能控制自己,老是要拜倒在他弟婦腳下,因為他認為她是女神的化身。我問為甚麼?他說:「因為她進入了跳神的狀態。」我說如果他認為弟婦是女神,就不要到我這裡來。後來他瞎了眼,完完全全的瞎了眼。他瞎了眼以後才到我這裡來,我們便把他的寬恕輪治好。

在霎哈嘉瑜伽怎樣清潔寬恕輪呢?你們可使用我的相片。在相片前燃點蠟燭。光是能治療寬恕輪的元素。常常用光或太陽光,因為基督是在太陽中。故此你要做的是將燭光放在面前,放另一支燭光在後面,在你的寬恕輪後部做像崇拜動作[倒馬蹄形]的靈體保護(Aarti),這是摩訶格涅沙(Maha Ganapati)及摩訶巴爾伐亞(Maha Bhairava)所在的位置。你只要在這裡做Aarti,寬恕輪便會打開。如何打開呢?十分簡單,若有甚麼雜念來到,你要說:「我寬恕。」這是基督給我們的最大武器。你只要說:「我寬恕,我寬恕。」便能勝過你的自我。這是寬恕輪前部的口訣,在那裡你只要說:「我寬恕,我寬恕,我寬恕。」你會發覺你的寬恕輪會打開,你會發覺你的自我會跑掉。「寬恕」是人類得到的其中一個最大的武器。但有些人十分愚蠢,我說要寬恕,他們說:「不寬恕又如何?」他們說寬恕十分困難。我說有甚麼困難?你要做甚麼呢?你說寬恕的時候,你有甚麼要做?你是否要做甚麼呢?甚麼也沒有。相反,若你不去寬恕,有甚麼會發生,就那個你不去寬恕的人,實際上是在折磨你,而不是你去折磨那人。故這是寬恕輪前部的口訣。在後部的,我已告訴你,就是要把燭光轉動。有些人會嘗試做一天,或是做兩天,但霎哈嘉瑜伽不是這樣生效的。你要認真的完全去做。我看過有些人眼睛倒視,從不能張大眼睛,但現在,已能張大眼睛,眼睛發揮正常的功用。要做是十分簡單的。

還有一種事情會在我們的眼睛裡發生,若我們的真知輪出現問題,這位置對應頭的後部,在寬恕輪後部的周圍。故此若患上糖尿病或類似的疾病,那人便會繼而失明,因為真知輪的位置是圍繞寬恕輪的後部,若出現問題便會擠壓寬恕輪後部,令眼睛不能看見,沒有了光,就像漆黑中的人張開眼睛,我看見很多糖尿病患者都會失明。因此首先要透過醫治真知輪去醫治糖尿病。你亦可用冰墊敷在頭後部的真知輪。但首先你要改善你的真知輪,你便會好得多。在這情況下,治療寬恕輪前部的是用光,後部的是用水。最好是視乎你的情況用光或用水。因為若真知輪出現問題便用水,若只是亡魂附身的問題,不是患上糖尿病,這樣你便要用光,這是醫治寬恕輪的方法。

即使耶穌基督也曾說:我是光,我是道路,因為祂是唵(Omkara),祂是道路。祂是那門,祂是那閘門,每個人都要從這閘門通過。祂從不說謊,但人們就把他釘死。他們就是要釘死祂。很幸運的是在我們的國家中,沒有已組織化的宗教。若你們有甚麼已組織化的宗教,你們便不會去接受霎哈嘉瑜伽。因為根據那些已組織化的宗教,你只能相信個人,而那個人就好像和其他人甚麼關係也沒有,他就像個孤獨的人掛在空中,他和甚麼人也沒有關係。因此要感謝神,在我們的國家中沒有發生這樣事情。因此我們這裡的人比其他國家的人,更適合霎哈嘉瑜伽,因為他們沒受太多的條件制約,這是一個很大的祝福。例如賽乃夫是原始宗師原理中最後降世的一個神祇,祂是回教徒,但祂的所有門徒都是印度教徒,他們不是回教徒。但回教徒不承認祂的神性。不單這樣,有一個地方叫Hazimallang,那裡有個回教徒聖人逝世,但他說:「只有婆羅門(Brahmins,意即得到自覺的靈),才能崇拜我。」故此他們聘請一些婆羅門,他們不明白「婆羅門」這個字的意思。那裡有印度教徒崇拜回教的先例。故此,若有人成為自覺的靈,他便沒有宗教,他是超越宗教,他「成為」宗教。沒有甚麼可束縛他,因為水滴已進入海洋,他成為海洋,因為對海洋來說是沒有限制的,因為他已超越限制,他是在一切事物之上。這是我們所相信的,就是若他是自覺的靈,他就是得到自覺的靈。有一次我到一個小村落,叫做Mian Ki Takdi,當我步入這村落,我感應到巨大的生命能量,我問:「有甚麼偉大的聖人在這裡居住?」他們說以往有一個回教修行者(peer),我說:「無論怎樣,他一定是聖人」。當我坐著講授的時候,有光照射我的頭上七次。第七次我如此舉起我的手。但沒有人看見那光,只有我知道。我知道那光,我和那光歡笑。而那些人拍攝的,便能拍照出來,在相片中看到。

所以所有得到自覺的靈都在周圍幫助,他們不會進入任何人的身體,不會麻煩你,他們只是指導你走正確的方向。帶他們的天使來幫助你到正確的道路,到正確的終點。他們從不會附在你的身上,從不會催眠你,或把你帶到錯誤的生活方向。因此,若你同樣是得到自覺的靈,你要知道你要完全地知道甚麼是真實。繼續去明白,嘗試去吸收,不要因為你要依附任何組織而拋棄它。在霎哈瑜伽裡沒有甚麼組織,你們也十分清楚知道。在霎哈嘉瑜伽裡,沒有組織,沒有會員證,但這是一個活生生的組織,是一個有生命的組織,因此任何事情在這裡發生,整個身體都會知悉,我們不用列明甚麼組織,霎哈嘉瑜伽的工作就是如此成就。

但我仍然要說的是,就如在我們的身體內有不同的感官系統,同樣,我們在霎哈嘉瑜伽裡都是一樣。有些人來練習,他們只是初學者,便不用說給他們知道,那些他們所不能承受的真理。若他們已明白了很多,已進入無思慮的入靜狀態(Nirvichar Samadhi)的人,他們便可以進入新的向度,但核心的人是那些在無疑惑的入靜狀態的人(Nirvikalpa),這些人才可以真的教授霎哈嘉瑜伽。若那人還是在次階段的,便會被篩走,因為這裡有吸入及排出的力量在工作,一種力量是把你吸引回來,另一種力量是把你趕出去。沒有人擔心要擁有一個龐大的成員組織。若是龐大而有好的,自然是希望拯救愈多人愈好。但沒有人會去游說你,沒有人會像馬戲團般去招攬你。到來與否是那人純潔的願望。這是個人的願望,那些來了的人,你不用做甚麼,你不能勉強人得到自覺。

這是我今天要向你們說有關寬恕輪的,我已在英國和美國講過很多次寬恕輪,有時亦會被一些教會及其他人士所針對,但我想若他們想繼續生存,他們「最好」要接受真理,「知道」他們所知的並不完全,他們要知道全面的真理。因為耶穌基督不能說太多,有關耶穌基督的話,門徒只能以他們所明白的方式記下。要明白耶穌基督,你們便要先得到自覺。

願神祝福你們。

If you have any questions, you can ask Me again today for a while and then I’ll make a move because today I was unusually late. But it happens. You have to get out of time. You have to get into timelessness. You have to get deconditioned about timing. Those who see time too much, they must learn to get out of time. And that is very, very important because time is according to certain auspiciousness has to be worked out. It is not to be worked out the way we think ‛this is the time“ and I cannot be the slave of this watch. I have another watch of My own. So it all works out that way. I am not guilty for coming late, but I’m sorry because you had to wait.
Hindi Speech:
Q: What is the reason for having dreams?
Shri Mataji: The reason for dreams is that when you are sleeping your attention moves either to the supraconscious side or to the subconscious side, your attention starts moving. And then you start seeing things which are connected with your subconscious or your collective subconscious and all this thing. And you may go onto the supraconscious side where you see your future and all this thing. But the reason why you get dreams actually is that the unconscious, which is within you, or you can say the Kundalini or your Atma is trying to guide you to the right path. And how does it guide you to the right path? Is through dreams. But these are misunderstood.
How do you understand these dreams because you are so confused. First, you go deep into yourself and you touch the unconscious — sushupti stithi. But from there you come out. And then when you are coming out, you touch your subconscious or maybe supraconscious. So whatever anubhuti you had, or whatever experience you had, of the depths of the sushupti gets confused and you don’t know what you dreamt, and you don’t understand and you forget it. But those who are realized souls go to their sushupti and see exactly what they have to know. Like many people in Bombay when I came, they didn’t know I was coming but they were at the airport because they got the dream. So at this sushupti level, at the deep level, you get the communication with God if you know how to go in and come out fully aware. But if you get confused with supraconscious or subconscious areas or if you start, your chitta is not so clear-cut, then there can be a big confusion.
Question — How can you compartmentalize? What happens when a person is a realized soul? What is the state? When he is a realized soul, what happens to a man?
Shri Mataji: See, the first thing is to say that ‛how can we compartmentalize it?“ because is the ego and superego is on two sides. Actually, have you not noticed in our body, everything is a compartment. You see even a cell is a compartment. Everything has a boundary. It’s not some sort of a ... even the blood has to pass through the channels. It has to go through these arteries. Everything is a compartment. There’s nothing like something just left there like a pulp. If it becomes the pulp, you won’t exist. So, everything is in compartment. Its ego and superego are like balloons and they are two balloons which can press each other, which can flow on one side. Now see the ego, though it is placed on the left hand side more, is placed like this on the left-hand side more, and this one on the right-hand side is the superego. Still, the ego when it increases in size it starts moving on the right-hand side and the superego, when it starts moving, it starts moving this way. So everything is in a compartment in our body. You are sadly mistaken if you think there’s anything is in a pulp, nothing. Or something like a air flowing in. Nothing like that. Everything has a channel. Everything is in a compartment.
Question — What happens to a man if he is a realized soul?
Shri Mataji: Now that is — I have been telling you what happens to a man he is a realized soul that his ego and superego are sucked in and he gets a dent in the fontanel bone area, and the Kundalini shoots off, and he can feel the Cool Breeze coming out of his head, and he can feel it in his hand. This is only on the central nervous system this happens. But so many things happen much more – how to use this power, what it means and all that you have to learn.
Question – In spite of tremendous stress on Kundalini by Your Holiness, it is hard for me to reconcile myself with the fact that there is not the slightest reference of Kundalini in the authoritative guides on yoga – I mean Patanjali's Yoga Sutras or Gita. Why?
Shri Mataji: Yes it is surprising that people will say ... He says that in Yoga Sutras of Patanjali it is not written about Kundalini and also about Gita it’s not written about Kundalini. Is a fact because, you see, it was a secret science. It was kept a secret science, in My first lecture only I said, till the Sixth Century. In the Sixth Century, Adi Shankaracharya for the first time opened his mouth about it. It was a secret science with very great gurus like Janaka gave Realization to Nachiketa. And in the same way Shri Krishna did not talk about it, because you see even when Markandeya talked about it, people did not know what he was talking. They never thought him to be a sensible man.
Then later on as the people became into two compartments, one on the right, one on the left side, some started worshipping God in a devotion and in a bhakti way, then another started doing yAgnya havanadi things. So whatever was required for these two types of things evolved and that’s what developed. The central side of evolution was kept a secret. And even at the time of Shri Krishna, it was not mentioned, not a word about this thing was mentioned because this is an internal happening, it’s antar yoga. It was not described, but Shri Krisha hinted at it, that you have to have your yoga. But how, He did not say because that was not the time. He was the one who laid the seeds. That’s why He is called as Krishna. Krishna means ‛krishi,“ the one who has done krishi. So this one was laid, the sprouting had to come. Today it was to be told.
So I am telling you about it. Everything is not told at the same time. Same in Sahaja Yoga. We don’t tell you everything at this state. About Agnya Chakra I have told you something, but not all. Gradually when you will be so aware, I will tell you. It has to be seen how far to be said at what time. And that’s what was needed at that time was told by Krishna. So Gita is the one which only tells you that this will happen. But Gyaneshwara, who was born after the sixth century, in Gyaneshwari has written about Kundalini clearly. Because, though Gita it is not written, but he said, ‛this is how it is done.“ Gynaeshawara has written. Though he has written, it’s not, it’s the Gita translated into a common language, he put also the knowledge of Kundalini. Because at that time, it was to be told. Before that, it was not to be told. Shankaracharya in the sixth century did it, then Gyaneshwara did it, then Nanaka did it, then Kabira did it. All these people did it. Not only, but even Mohammed Sahib in a way has talked about it – about the Sahaja Yoga and resurrection time. They all started talking about the resurrection time much later as they started seeing people getting it. Because to talk too much about the future is dangerous. That time Shri Krishna was placed with Arjuna when they were at the war, and that time He had to talk about the problems of hinsa, ahinsa and those ideas which we have about — wrong ideas we have. And that’s how He talked on that subject. Whatever was the subject, He talked on that and He told him how to become one with God ... not how...that when you become one with God, you become a stithaprAgnya. He gave the idea as to what will happen to you. But how it will happen He did not say. That was left to Me to explain. They can’t do everything, I have to do something, isn’t it? Because if He had said how, then they would have said, ‛Give me Realization.“ But they were not prepared for realization.
Question: I have tried to go into spiritualism in the real sense of the word. But my health is deteriorating day by day.
Shri Mataji: Some gentleman has done spiritualism in the real sense of the word, and his health is deteriorating. I have told you already what is the reason for that is – you take to spiritualism out of ignorance. There’s no spiritualism. There is no ‛ism“ with God. Spirit cannot be ‛ismized“. So, you take to Sahaja Yoga. Become your Spirit. You cannot ‛ism“ it. That’s one thing you cannot ‛ism.“ You can have ‛isms“ in everything. But Spirit is detached. It cannot be put into ‛isms.“ So those who say ‛spiritualism“ must know they have done wrong. All right? You come to Sahaja Yoga and forget it. I know I am sorry for that. You are misled but God is there and Spirit is there. In Sahaja Yoga we promise you that. Whatever mistakes you have done, it can be corrected. Hindi Speech.
I would say that whatever I said today, you must take the tape and listen to it at home. I’ve said all these things already. But your attention should have been there. Now you take a tape from these people. Listen to it. I’ve said the same thing which you are telling – that these are the problems of a big person who goes to these things and how he gets into problems. All right? So when you come to Sahaja Yoga. I know you are a seeker. And, if you are a seeker, that will be given to you. That’s your right to have it.
May God bless you.
Question: Which will be the end of all the world and of humankind?
Shri Mataji: Which will be the end of world? Again, futuristic, very futuristic. Let’s not talk about the end. Just now is the beginning. When the child is born we just don’t think about his death, do we? So better be worried about the beginning of this new world that we have started and don’t think of the death and all those things. Forget it for the time being.
Question: [written question in Hindi from a Sahaja Yogi from Kanpur]
Shri Mataji: There’s a gentleman from Kanpur he says that in Kanpur people are only interested in the physical curing. Have nothing to do with these wretched people, in this place. You just have nothing to do with them. If they are interested in material well being, Sahaja Yoga is not for such people. At all. If they don’t want to have God. Forget them. Let Kanpur be drowned in Ganges if they are like that. Useless people. Absolutely. Why should you worry about them? If they don’t want to have God. Don’t waste your energy on people who just want to be cured. It’s absolutely useless such people, they are very selfish, self-centred and troublesome. They are good for nothing. If they don’t want to have God, we have nothing to do with them. We have no relationship with them. They can go to the hospitals, take expensive medicines and die there.
I don’t like people who just come to Sahaja Yoga for only physical fitness. Is this is a hospital, or what? Reducing it to that level is not good. Anybody who thinks that he should help others should start helping them in Kundalini and not start curing people. Please don’t do that. I’ve told a hundred times, don’t do curing. Because what will happen if you start curing you’ll start thinking that ‛I’m curing“ and you’ll get into supraconscious. So better not do it. You just put yourself into a state which is proper for Sahaja Yoga. Gradually people will know you and will start coming to you.
But as far as is U.P. is concerned, God save that country, that place. I am married in that place. I know the people. Useless, absolutely good for nothing. They made Sitaji go to Banbas, who can forgive them? All dobhis, that’s all. U.P. wallas have a very great ego, you know. We had a servant who was from U.P. I am also married in U.P. I shouldn’t say but I saw that very clearly. And we had another one who was from Madras. So he was very clean Madrasi fellow, cleaning everything nicely, working very hard.
So I told this U.P. walla, I said that ‛If you don’t learn all these qualities, one day you will have no jobs in Delhi and you’ll all go out of jobs. You’d better learn all these qualities of Madrasi people – how neat they are, clean they are. They take their baths every day. You’re a lazy lump.“
So he said, ‛Ah, thika, inko to bartan majne dijiye hum to raj karange. [Hindi. Translation: all right, let them clean utensils, we will rule]
They are all going to do raj, just imagine. So one must understand that every place has its own problems. Out of them U.P. and Bihar, I don’t know how it is going to work out. I am worried. I have already tried to send somebody to Lucknow to do something. My house is in Lucknow. My relations are in Lucknow. I’ve given Realization to all My relations but they find it strange, the whole thing is so strange, you know. You don’t know what to do with that place. Imagine a nawab married three hundred and sixty-five wives. Can you imagine such a nawab living in that horrid place? Singing gazals morning till evening. All the dirty things they do. And I don’t know if you can really bring them around.
There are some nice people. I wouldn’t say there aren’t. But on the whole, the whole system is based on something very nonsensical and to bring them around.... Specially Kanpur is such a materialistic place, very materialistic. Very materialistic people. The Ganges flows — Ganga, Gomati, Yamuna — all these rivers are in the north, cleansing morning till evening, working so very hard. When will the people realize?
So the Kanpur gentleman should come and settle down in Maharashtra. Rama also had to leave with Sita. [In Hindi – Shri Mataji says sorry to people in audience who are from UP – the place of Shri Mataji’s in-laws.]
Question: When I give realization to persons who have meagre desire or to my own family members as there is no Sahaja Yogi?
Shri Mataji: No, no, no, no, no. Don’t try your family members. That’s not proper. Those who have no desire for Sahaja Yoga, you cannot push them in. It’s impossible. Who is your family? These are your family.
Like Christ once they asked, ‛Your brothers and sisters are calling You.“
He said, ‛Who are My brothers?“
‛Your brothers are calling You.“
He said, ‛Who are My brothers?“ He looked around.
Don’t push your family members. All right? They’ll become bhoots. Because if you push them, imagine, Agnya Chakra is closed, they’ll go to the left or to the right. They’ll become bhoots or not. Don’t push them at all.
What else?
Question: One of my cousin brothers here in Delhi where I’m staying drinks wine but does not want to come to the Sahaj Yog program in spite of my persuasion as he’s convinced that he simply can’t drink or smoke after attending the program.
Shri Mataji: You see, somebody’s brother doesn’t want to come to Sahaja Yoga program because he thinks after coming to program he cannot drink and smoke. Now, I would say that you need not tell him this secret that after Sahaja Yoga you don’t drink and smoke. You need not tell him. Once you bring him and he gets Realization, he will not do it. So let us manage it on that level. Better not tell him if you are interested. I don’t say. Did I say, ‛Don’t drink, don’t smoke“? Did I say so? I don’t say so. But it just happens. So just let it be, let them come as they are.

Translation from Hindi:
Shri Mataji: What are they saying? Tell Me if it is sensible, otherwise there is no point in wasting time on useless talks.

Sahaja Yogi (reading out): Revered Mother, I bow to You respectfully at Your lotus feet. The meditation we do in Mooladhara chakra, of Shri Ganesha, how should it be done? How is the scene at Mooladhara meditation? Meaning do we see the nadis nearby or is there some other scene?

Shri Mataji: You have asked that how should we do meditation of Ganeshji? And whether we can see something there on the Nadi or not.

I told you today itself that if you see something then you are outside. Because when you see you halt.  Your movememt stops. There is nothing to see. You don’t see any scene. You are there. Seeing anything is wrong. If anyone sees anything, then they are not there. And you should not see also.

While going to the airport from here, you see thousands of scenes. If we go on looking at all this, how will we reach the airport? We have to reach the airport. That’s why stop seeing. just imbibe and absorb. That is important.  Experience.

You asked how we should do meditation of Shri Ganesha. For this you please come to our centre. There you will be taught the method of meditation. Learn that properly and listen to what they tell you. You may not even need to do meditation on Shri Ganesha. They will tell you on what to meditate. You yourself will come to know on which (chakra) you have to meditate.

Based on your state, based on your requirement, you will come to know yourself and you will be able to judge for yourself.

Sahaja Yogi (reading a question): Body is purified by water, mind by truth. And soul by – he has left it blank. Is it austerity and reason?

Shri Mataji: He has asked – body is purified by water and mind by what?

Sahaja Yogi: Mind by truth

Shri Mataji: Mind by truth and ..

Sahaja Yogi: Soul is by – he has left it blank. Is it by austerity and reason?

Shri Mataji: He thinks soul is purified by austerity. Not at all. it doesn’t happen. It is the other way round. In Sahaja Yoga, first the top floor is built then the lower ones. First you are given realization. In the light of that you see what is wrong with you.  Where the dirt is in your body.  In that light you understand where your mind is unclean. In that light you see the problems of your soul. First the lamp is lit.

Shri Krishna has also said  that this tree (of awareness) is hanging upside down. The tree of life is hanging upside down. Its branches grow downwards, and its roots are on top.  So first of all, we take you up and give realization in the roots itself. First understand the roots. Once the roots become alright, the rest of the tree will become alright by itself.

This is the significance of Sahaja Yoga. First the root is awakened.

Even otherwise, if you have to treat any tree and you say – „ first make the leaves alright, then make the trunk in the center alright”. Nothing can be done.

But if you go down to the roots directly, then through  the roots you can save the entire tree. This is the path of Sahaja Yoga that you go down to your roots. The root is on top at the Sahasrara. Then you are nourished by the Chaitanya, with which all your mind, knowledge, ego and body, whatever other physical problem you have, is cleared out.

1:18:22  -  If there are any people from UP (North India) please forgive Me.  That is the place of My in laws.

1:20:23  - This person says „there is a problem with my stomach.  My liver region is swollen.  There are soe light patches on my back”.

Shri Mataji:  This person says he has a problem with his stomach, his spleen is bad, etc..  If he has smoked, or drunk alcohol, then may God save him, because our hands are tied.  So the first letter that came, is its answer in the second letter.

That is why, only when they get pain in the stomach, they will come to Sahaja Yoga.  When their spleen gets enlarged, then they will come to Sahaja Yoga.  Those whose spleen is enlarged should come to the Center, in the same way that you go to a doctor, with full faith they should come.  Anywhere else people charge, take away your money, and sometimes even your life. No one knows.

But those who come to Sahaja Yoga with full faith and trust, they get all the treatment and advice free of charge.  And if they do the treatments with full faith and devotion, they get immediate benefits.  But because it is free, people do not respect or value it.  You come and tell us all your problems, and after that, not only uyour complaints will be solved, but you will also get union with Paramatma (God almighty).  Has this ever happened anywhere?

There is a proverb – I went to ask God for light, and instead He gave me Paigambari (prophet or apostlehood)

That is the situation in Sahaja Yoga.  You will come to ask for fire or flame, and you will get sainthood.  He spoke about it – William Blake.  That men of God will become prophets. And they will have the power to make others prophets.

We are giving you „Paigam”.  You will come to cure your spleen, and you will take back with you prophet-hood.  This is what is Sahaja Yoga.  It is such a great thing.  Even to understand it you have to have that intrinsic quality.

Shri Mataji – Finished?  Now please excuse Me.  Those who wish to touch My Feet, may come.  But with decorum.  Dont rush.  Dont run.  I am sitting here.
