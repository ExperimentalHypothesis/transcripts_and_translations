Puja in Satara: Shivaji the Anchavatara. Satara (India), 7th February 1984

It is not proper, but He was not just a mere king, you see He was a Devi bhakta and an ansha avtara and His Mother was also an ansha avtara.  What is the sign of an ansha avtara is that they have extra powers over themselves and over others, and they have no temptations, no mistakes.  

[Shree Mataji speaks in Marathi to the sound technicians about the sound system problem.]  

So, first of all we should know that Shivaji himself was a divine person in the sense that He had no defects in him.  He was a detached personality.  I do not want to tell you the whole history about him, but his character if you study you will be amazed how detached He was.  He was not found of women.  He never hankered after them and on the contrary respected women very much.  There is a story that once He was presented with the daughter-in-law of a great nawab because the people used to do, I do not know what you call those tactics where you attack the people hiding from behind.  

[Shree Mataji is speaking with the sound technicians and the Sahaja Yogis present there about failure of the sound system due to load shedding, load shedding is a problem the people of this place face every Tuesday.  Shree Mataji asks the Sahaja Yogis present there to try to listen to Her from their Sahastara, pay attention to Her and they will be able to listen Her.]

So, this great king Shivaji was a man without any temptation for women and once He was presented with a very beautiful lady who was the daughter-in-law of a big nawab, because they looted lot of money and lot of precious things and this lady as well when her caravan was passing through some passage in the mountains. So Shivaji looked at her.  He asked her to remover her veil because she was a Muslim lady and then looking at her He said that if my mother was as beautiful as you are, I would have been equally beautiful, is the best way to say you are my sister.  He himself had to marry four times because of certain problems of political nature where He had to marry four women, but He married them, because He had to marry and all the four wives were his wives and no other women came into his head.  This is such a tremendous character.  This is first sign of a personality who is really mature, who has no attention towards another women, which is very common in Maharasthra it is not difficult for them they do not understand what I am talking about.  This is one of the things one has to understand how respectful He was to other women.  That He gave away all her things, all her money, all her jewelry, all that was looted of that nawab also, all the arms everything, and sent back all the people to the nawab, because if there is a lady she is the shakti, she is traveling so nobody has business to trouble her.  This was his respect for women who belonged actually to another party.  He had so many qualities that it is impossible to describe on that but absolutely honest, absolutely honest He was and He lived like a saint.  He did not care for comfort.  If you go and see his things that the had you will be amazed, He could sleep on the stones, but for his kingship He had to wear all the ornaments, all the dresses which He used to wear.  If you go in Bombay museum you will see chilkhat we call it a cover made out of iron mesh.  He used to wear that, it is so heavy that you cannot lift it, but He had to wear it and He used to fight his wars wearing that, but like all other kings you see in the west He did not have weaknesses, He had no habits, extremely honest, Spartan in temperament, and absolute ideal king He was, an absolute ideal king.  He talked to everyone on the same level, treated everybody with respect, never showed off that he was a king, but He kept his dignity all the time and when it was needed to be corrected with all courage He corrected people, He did not care for cheap popularity either.  Such a man was a blessing to Maharashtra because He is such an ideal for us and for people to follow and His mother was a great lady who brought him out of the clutches of the Mughal people who tried to convert forcibly Hindus to Islam.  Like this Aurangzeb he used to hate music, and he would kill, very right sided fellow, every year the brahmins so many brahmins that the thread they used to weigh according to his body weight.  So you can imagine what a cruel man he was.  He was like Hitler only, but he was also very honest in the sense he used to make his own caps and sell them and live on that money.  He was very right sided who was honest as far as the money was concerned, the government money was concerned, but he was so fanatically imprisoned in his own ideas about God that he had become just like a rakshasha.  To face him was very difficult was very difficult in those days, he was a terror.  Nobody could face Hitler from inside but Shivaji managed it, and he did it so well.  

So Satara is a place where he established his first kingdom.  This is the capital of Maharashtra, Satara, that is why it is a very important place.  Secondly, after Shivaji, or when Shivaji was the king looking after the whole worldly affairs, his own son fell into a bad company of a fellow who came from Uttar Pradesh called Kabji Kalusha who started drinking and doing all wrong things that should not be done.  He was imprisoned, but even then he was a very-very lost case, but a good hearted fellow that is why this Maharasthra was divided into two and his younger brother had to form another kingdom or another part of the capital was in Kohlapur where I think you have seen Sahu Maharaja's statue there.  So he was a very dharmic fellow, very good person and he looked after that part very well.  So, Kohlapur started another capital, but what I am trying to say that when negativity starts crawling into something great, then it starts getting divided and it is now a very common character they say of Marathas that they indulge in Bhau Bandki, always form groups.  I find it even happening in Sahaja Yoga.  I went to Rahuri, I felt that in Rahuri also there is a kind of Bhau Bandki working out.  This is character of Marathas and they have to be very-very careful about it.  One of them is Bhau Bandki that they form a group suddenly and separate themselves from one another and start fighting each other, it is sort of a coagulation that takes place in their temperaments.  One must understand that unless and until absolutely we are united we cannot do Sahaja Yoga.  So this kind of separation is a very wrong thing which should be avoided out and out and one thing I want to tell all the Maharashtrians that they have to be careful on this point is Bhau Bandki.  This comes out of jealousy out of thirst for power, for not accepting somebody as the leader, trying to find faults all the time.  If the leader is wrong also it can happen.  If the leader goes wrong if he is not a person who can carry on well with others and something it can happen.  So it is quite a mutual thing that works out but as a result of the whole thing is that it starts getting bifurcated and that is how we lost the kingdom of Maharasthra ultimately.  So it's a very good example of understanding how Shivaji worked hard fought Aurangzeb, established his kingdom and how it was lost in second generation itself.

[Shree Mataji addresses in Marathi about Shivaji, that how he established His capital in Satara, that we should try imbibe his character.  His utmost quality was that he did not have any dosha (wrong). He did not have any habits.  He never had the ego that he was the king, he used to eat with his people, talk to them.  Shivaji was a Ansha Avtara, he was devoted to his mother, never spoke in front of her or against he, he was not proud of being a king.  She also addresses about Bhau Bandki which she says is a thing the Maharashtrians should be careful of.  Mother says that one should work for others, and not think about only oneself.  One should not find faults in others, first he should find faults within himself.  Love for others is most important in Sahaja Yoga.  Nothing is impossible for a Sahaja Yogi who has has established self realization, who meditates regularly, and participates in the collective meditation.]
