t...this evening we all are meeting, there is going to be an interview with some newspaper people, and after that, what’s the program? There’s a dance and a recitation, and then we’ll have our dinner there, at Jaeger palace. Everything is so beautiful, and I must say this Puja was so wonderfully done that all my vibrations are out, and not feeling the strain after that at all, that’s something good, so few people but they absorbed, that means very deep people are here, may God bless you. If you are little little parts you cannot feel it, but if you have big big pictures it feels fast. May God bless you. That means that the bakti of who performed the puja has worked out. May God bless you.
