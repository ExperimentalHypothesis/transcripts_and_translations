[Hindi], there are so many new faces today that I would like to give you some idea about what is Sahaja Yoga.

Saha means with and Ja means born. Sahaja, that means it is born with you. It is a property or it is a right of every human being to be united with God Almighty. Now when I take the name of God Almighty all the scientists will immediately say that, Mataji you have already a conception in your mind that there is God. How are we to believe that there is God? Sahaja Yoga is the method, is the style, is the process by which you become connected with the divine power which we call as unconscious mind in the psychological terminology. They believe in the unconscious mind but not in God. Alright, let us forget God. So this is a method by which you jump into your (अचेतन) Achetana. We have to think as all scientists have to keep their minds open to understand why from amoeba stage to this human stage we have arrived.

How is it no scientist has ever bothered to know why? How is different? They might be said how it happened but why? What is the reason? Have we reached the ultimate, the destination or we are still in the transition stage? Definitely in knowledge we have not reached the ultimate. This all the scientists have to accept. If you are a doctor you will know that we do not know anything about parasympathetic nervous system. You call it parasympathetic. Supposing I say that is the system which is worked by God you get a shock.

But you do not know anything about parasympathetic. You do not know many things. You cannot explain many things. Perhaps we are in the transition in such a stage that the knowledge is not complete with us. I mean at least this much of hypothesis every scientist must accept. Rule out God. But you cannot rule out unconscious mind about which all the scientists, all the psychologists are talking. That there is an unconscious mind which is universally conscious, which acts universally in our dreams and gives us symbols which are universally the same. They cannot explain. Some introspection is needed.

Some introspection is needed to find out why. Human beings are really very busy with something very unimportant according to me. But if we are in transition, if there is a goal where we have to reach, then whatever is our knowledge is not complete, is partial and we have not to accept it as the complete and ultimate and absolute. So we accept that it is not yet completely known. In the countries which are called as developed countries, so called, where assurance has come so much, where people are materially well off, we find there are more suicides, more unhappiness than among people who are starving. The starving people want to exist and the overfed want to kill themselves. That means they have not yet achieved the satisfaction of living. That is clear. So is there something that is beyond? It is such a contradiction with which human beings live all the time.

For example, in the house of every Indian you will find a Ganesha's murti there, if he is a Christian, Christ's murti there, if he is a Muslim he will have kurana sharif or he will do namas. On one side they believe that there is God. They read scriptures, they read Gita. On the other side they do not want to believe also that there is God when it comes to fact. Now is there God or not? Is it a fact? You should not accept me because I say so. No. But you should not also deny me. If you deny me that means you are not a scientist.

If you are a scientist then keep yourself open. And listen to me and experience the actualization of what I am saying. Actualization is the word. साक्षात्कार (Sākṣātkāra). Actualization. It is not only preaching but the actualization. Now you may say what is actualization? Actualization is an experience by which [Hindi] The actualization is an experience of knowing what you are here for Why you have become a human being? What is the purpose of knowing whether there is God or not? All the absolute questions can be answered through actualization only.

If I want to put a [unclear], if you could understand it without getting too much involved into it, I would say you all are like computers. I think the most modern instrument is a computer. You are all made very beautifully, delicately, with great pains. You are made a complicated computer. All of you. But you don't get any information. You don't give any information. You don't give any information. Only thing you are to be put to the mains. If you do not put this instrument to the mains, means if you do not connect it to the electricity, to the power, it cannot work.

In the same way the computer cannot give the information unless and until it is put to the mains. What is a Sahaja Yogi is that you are a computer and you are put to the mains. Then you see the information. But unless and until you are put to the mains, how am I to prove everything? So a vicious circle of the mind playing works out. You must prove it to us. Can you discuss about it? Supposing there is a computer which is not put to the mains. What is this I am discussing about it? Let me put to the mains and then I will show you how it works.

So this is a very simple thing which a scientist has to accept. For one reason that scientists among themselves are not dealing with one person. A medical scientist is dealing with the body, curing the body. While another scientist is dealing with the psyche, another one is dealing with... Say we can say that one has one eye to be dealt with, another has another eye to be dealt with. It's an analytical process. How do you explain love? From where does it come? How do you explain so many things? If you start analyzing love, then love dies. If you start analyzing a man, he dies.

So how to deal with it is the problem. There is a very, very extremely simple way of looking at it all. From amoeba to human beings you have become is an accepted fact by all the scientists, all right. But who has done this job? Have you done it? Have you done it? You are just human beings without doing any job about it. Maybe somebody has done it for you. Maybe you are not aware of it. How did you become a human being from amoeba?

Without your knowledge, without any effort being put in, you just became human beings. So maybe there is a chance that you will become that human being, that computer which is working, by some method which you cannot do yourself. What man can do is to rationalize everything, rationality. He can think about it. But by thinking through this rational mind which is limited, you cannot jump into something that is unlimited. So you cannot work out that process. But it's too much for human ego to accept that how is it we cannot do anything about God. We will do everything on our heads. We will do everything. We will take sannyasa, we will do this, we will do that.

Even we will become naked. They think by becoming naked they will get God. All this is mental process going on around. He is not going to achieve that. It is sahaja. It is spontaneous. It is a spontaneous happening which is going to happen to many of you, not all of you. Because some fishes came to the shore, not all of you. It's not needed. Out of all the seeds everybody is not going to germinate.

And all those who germinate, all of them are not going to bear fruits. And all of the fruits that they create, not all of them are not going to be ripened. Some of them and some of them and some of them and ultimately you have the chosen ones who get it. So when we talk of spontaneity still we should not talk of God because I do not want to bring in God unnecessarily. But this is a happening and we are very lucky people to be born in this great country where already lot of research has been done through meditation. And people have written about the mechanism that exists within us, the chord that exists within us which is applied to the mains. And they call it as Kundalini. Sahaja Yoga is nothing but is a sahaja Kundalini Yoga. There is no other Kundalini Yoga. Kundalini Yoga is always Sahaja Yoga.

All the horrible things you hear about Kundalini is not Kundalini Yoga is the anger of Sri Ganesha or you can say the anger of Kundalini for doing all kinds of nonsensical things. Kundalini is your mother. She is with you every life you come. She knows all about you. She is a residual power in the coccyx, in the triangular bone. She is waiting there for a moment when somebody who is authorized to do the job comes in, she rises herself and you get the realization. You get that connection with the [unclear]. It is spontaneous. You cannot do it. First of all you must know.

It acts. You can feel it. People like Shankaracharya have described. Of course nobody reads these days. You see we read Freud. That suits us better. We are modern people. We don't read Shankaracharya but he has described the Chaitanya Lahiri. This is what you must seek. In the Kali Yuga there is one thing very great is that everything is already written.

Nobody has to write anything anymore about it. Already written what to expect, what is a holy person, how to recognize the person, who is going to give you realization, what are the symbols. It's already written. But nobody reads. People have no time to read. That it is the Sahaja Yoga if you read Nanak you read Kabir, you read Shankara. Only Indians so many, even if you go in the western side you can say Christ. All of them have been saying the same thing. That you are to be born again and that you have to be that personality in which you become one with kingdom of God. Even if you discard the whole lot of them, still I would say what about parasympathetic nervous system.

The doctors cannot explain why in the human body aceticoline and adrenaline two chemicals act differently. It's most surprising. They cannot explain the mode of action. The reason is there are some deities sitting who decide. Another simple thing they cannot explain that anything that foreign goes in the body is thrown out, is thrown away as a nature. Wants everything to be thrown out of body but when the fetus fixes, I mean enters, we can say the fetus when it is formed. Not only it is kept there but it is also nurtured and looked after and all the protection is rendered to that fetus who decides about it in the stomach. It is a deity sitting down there. There is a deity otherwise it's not possible somebody sitting down there who is doing the job. But to believe into these things is very difficult.

It is better to say that we don't know the mode of action, we don't know why, we don't know this. But now it is for the scientists to open their heads now and see that science has not reached you to the completion or to the absolute knowledge. But Sahaja Yoga can because you become knowledge. The Kundalini rises, it comes up through different chakras, it doesn't give you any trouble. Don't read these horror books on Kundalini. They are all horrid people. They are not authorized to touch them. Kundalini can only be risen by the holiest of holy personalities. The ones who respect the womanhood, the motherhood because she is the mother, those who insult the Kundalini, those who try to excite sex in the name of Kundalini are the greatest sinners and they will be going to hell and no other place. At least in India we understand the value of motherhood.

They are trying to put the sex on the Kundalini which is your mother. Would you like to do that? And then Sri Ganesha who is looking after the protocol of the mother gets annoyed and in that temper they develop those blisters and those horrible symptoms that they describe in their books and people are enamored. Surprising, how can your mother be unkind to you? How can she be? Troubling you she is waiting for that moment. She doesn't require much except that she wants you to be placed in the presence of a person who knows the job. Human beings are already sublimated people. You don't have to sublimate the sex. Actually Kundalini is placed much higher at the triangular bone while the sex point is controlled by a center which is much lower.

I mean any doctor can see this that the residual consciousness is placed on the triangular bone. If it is, I can show you it pulsating in your presence I can show you and thousands of them have seen here. There are many who have seen it pulsating. With your naked eyes whether you are realized or not you can see it pulsating. It pulsates, you can see the rising, you can feel with the stethoscope the rising of the Kundalini. And there is no symptom of any kind that is described in these horror books of Kundalini. They have no authority to talk on Kundalini. You have to be a holy personality. You cannot touch God. If you are drinking and using women and talking of God at the same breath you are the greatest sinner and such sins will never be forgiven.

Not by changing only your dresses. You have an authority to talk about God. Everybody starts talking about God. What is their authority? They don't even have a grain of holiness in them. But at least they must have some wisdom to understand to commit such sins, to go against the powers of God, to behave in this way. Nobody is going to forgive them. And those who follow such foolish people also must know that they are just following their own weaknesses. They are running after these people only because they have weaknesses for this kind of perversion in them. In the West people have already done these things without having any gurus or leaders.

Here we have got very nice gurus who are also making money out of this. They are leaders in this. And today they are coming back to me that mother forgive us for what we have done. This is what a scientist has to understand that holiness is a part of human being. It is a part because when we talk to our children we do not like unholy things from our children. We will do ourselves secretly. Why we don't want our children to be unholy? Why not? If you think unholyness is nothing wrong in it, why do you do that? For example, if we know something is poisonous, we tell our children not to take it.

Even prostitutes want their children to lead a holy life. Why? Because they understand from inside through their unconscious training that holiness is a part of human being. I don't say you have to be holiest of holiness. But every human being has got a dharma, a sustaining power. As you can see this gold, the gold has got a sustaining power. It will be called gold only when it is not tarnishable. If it is tarnishable, it is not gold anymore. In the same way human being has got ten dharmas which he has to be there as a human being. Otherwise he is a delinquent or he is a sick fellow or he is a he is a rakshasa.

That's the word. He is a devil. He is not a human being. The human being must have those ten simple things to be a human being. All these people have preached it. It's not that I am preaching it for the first time. For the first time, Mohammed Sahib, he taught not to drink. But in the Islamic, I don't know what's wrong with them, but if you go to these Islamic countries, they drink like fish. They have made poetry on drinking. There is Umar Khayyam singing about drinking.

You just cannot imagine. Christ has said that don't go near the spirits. Don't worry about the past, about the dead. Don't use spirits for showing off your chamatkara. Don't use spirits. But in the West, if you go you will be amazed. In London where I live, I have seen every third corner you find the negative man being implanted something and whatever were remaining we exported from here. You are very good at exporting the greatest crooks of the world. It's a shameful thing but we have done it. And I say [responsible/unclear].

They have cheated them, looted them and they say they know about God. They are going to give experiences. This is what it is. This is what Ghor Kali Yuga, where the rakshas are, have taken birth today and they are claiming and they are saying that we are the people in charge of religion. What religious thing they have done so far? How many people have got realization from them? Only you go and see their powers, they have to give you powers. You are to be empowered, your powers yourself must be manifested. That is what it is written in all the scriptures, Gita, Bible, Quran. There is nowhere written all these things that they will be doing.

Your own powers through the vibrations of Chaitanya is not described only by Shankaracharya. Everywhere if you really go and search it out this is being described. But people don't want reality perhaps. They don't want the truth. They want some spectacular things. Is it? Is it that you think that now in Kali Yuga you can have a guru somewhere posted there and in charge of all your sins and everything. He is looking after you there and you do whatever you please. It is a very common thing I am surprised. See I went to Singapore and there were some people who came to see me and they said, Mataji we are in a very great mess.

You must take us out of it. I said what happened? In Jakarta we lost all our money because we were smuggling things and all the money smuggled, whatever these textiles smuggled are taken away by the government there. I said now what can I do about your smuggling habits? I don't understand. But what about your guru? He said our guru never said anything to us. Whatever we did we had smuggling, we were having drinking, we were having 10 wives here, 10 wives there, 15 women there. He never said to us. Only thing he said is you give us the purse that's all.

You give us the [unclear]. You do whatever you please. You come and touch my feet. Thousands of people were away. They will all go. The guru will be sitting on 7 feet high and these will be going just to touch his feet or drugged falling and leaking that dust. Because what is the guru doing? He is allowing you to do whatever you like. He is not giving you realization. He is not interested in anything like that.

But he is only interested in your purse. Even if they were interested only in purse I said all right forget them. You see there are another cheats and smugglers that thank God now. Nowadays with emergency they are being fought. But this kind of people they are all right forget them. But it's not so. If it were only that much I would have been very much satisfied all right forget them. These fools are being befooled. It's all right. But it's not only that.

But they spoil your Kundalini. They have spoiled the Kundalini of thousands of people and the chances of your realization are very zero. I must say absolutely nil with so many people. Absolutely nil. The reason is this forehead of man, Mata, has been created in so many yoni's and so many lives it has passed through to create this human Mata. It's a very great thing that a human being has here. It is not to be put to a man who is even lesser than you as far as the humanity is concerned. He lives on your arms. Will you accept a single pie from me if I say all right I'll give you you please have your food. Will you take this beggars position?

Will you live on others' people's food? Will you live on others' people's money? You have bowed to falsehood. And this is what is not easily forgiven. I'm sorry but you just can't do it. It is like as if in the Kundalini there's a very big wound which is being created. Is a fact I'm telling you. I've seen thousands and thousands of people. It's the fact that this thing if it is has bowed to wrong type of people somehow God doesn't work. One has to work very hard but with some people the Kundalini rises just like this.

The other time we had a big program downstairs if you remember. We had Justice White speaking to you and he told you about his realization how he got it. He said that I was just sitting in front of Mataji and two balls of ice as if came on to my hand and they started melting into me. And the peace and the bliss started flowing into my being. And since that day I always have that flow into me and the vibrations are flowing. It happened. He never lost it. He was there. He's a beautiful personality. Because not he's a justice or anything.

Such a person can exist anywhere. God recognizes them and He grants them. To the small children it works just like this. They are innocent people. We have some physical problems we have. We have some mental problems. We have some emotional problems. Alright. The Kundalini rises. She first of all nourishes the beings within us.

For example She gives physical comfort and that's how we have been able to cure cancer. We have definitely cured cancer. This I claim today and always I'll claim that we have got somebody here who has been fully cured. [unclear] But we have cured. So we are not interested. Because first we have to make some doctors of Sahaja Yoga. Let us prepare some people to be the doctors of Sahaja Yoga. Because once you say I cure cancer they'll say go to the cancer hospital and cure. Why should I? God can always cure them by giving them second birth.

First of all let us have some doctors of Sahaja Yoga. So ask me for the real not for only physical. There are so many like that. At the time of Christ also same problem. All His disciples started bringing all the sick people and he got so fed up of them. That's just a byproduct. Emotionally perhaps you have come for the first time but people have seen many mad people we have cured emotionally. Tomorrow we are going to have a program for curatives also in the morning time. We have cured mentally upset people, disturbed people and very very sick people who were violent. But that's not our job.

It's a byproduct. We have just to say that if you are seeking the truth, if you are really genuinely want to become one with that universal power of God. Then please ask for that first of all. Get that. Become a Sakshi, become a witness which Krishna has preached. That becomes the witness. I am here as your mother. Very great difference it is. You see mother will scold you. She will be angry sometimes.

But you know in your heart of hearts that she loves you very much. And she has tremendous patience for you. And she thinks of only your Kalyana and of your Moksha. For Sahaja Yoga has to be at this time because Satya Yuga is already dawned. What is Satya Yuga? In the Satya Yuga people start feeling God's divine love. They enter into the kingdom of God. How do you say that they have entered into the kingdom of God? Because their awareness has changed into love awareness. In which they collectively can feel another personality.

When the Kundalini rises, when you become realized, for example this gentleman is sitting before me. I can feel what's wrong with him. Where is the problem. Even a child can feel. If he is a realized soul, now my grandchild, you won't believe. She is hardly, I would say, hardly born because she is not even one year old. But as soon as somebody comes to the problem, immediately she takes out the finger which is burning and people know that this is the thing and that is the thing. Supposing this finger is burning on the right hand side, if you ask that person, have you got stomach trouble, he will say yes I have. Everybody will say this is the finger and this finger denotes on the right hand side is the solar plexus, the trouble in the solar plexus. With little practice and you understand also where it is exact, then you know where it is on the liver.

Or which part? If this finger is catching then you know in a woman if it is, it's a uterus. Now what do you do in a Sahaja Yoga? Now see here the question of God comes in. Now you see this is catching, what do you do? You immediately know the uterus is something wrong, you ask the person is it wrong? Yes, you put your hand on the uterus. You give these vibrations. These vibrations are the synthesis of all the powers, the creative power, the existence power and evolutionary power. All these three powers combined together are in this.

So when they go to that part which is diseased, it gets cured and the burning from the hand passes out. Immediately you feel alright, there is nothing wrong with the person, the person is alright, he is cured. Then people say how can it be? It is. Now how do you know there is God? When you have vibrations, you put your hands and ask the question is there God? Immediately a flow of vibrations starts, answer comes. You put the question, just say what's wrong with this gentleman? Immediately your fingers denote, these fingers I am here to decode them. These fingers denote different centers in your body.

If you study them a little bit, you will know that this is the matter with this person. Now with little bit like this even you can cure that person. With the vibrations if you put around the aura of the person like a paraboli, you can give protection to that person. All absolute questions can be answered if you are a realized soul, otherwise you cannot answer. But the basic problem was so far that all such realized souls were born at that height and the whole world was at that height. When Kabita said, ida pingala nadi, he said sukhamana nadi, he said the śūnya śikhara pe anahata bole, people said what is this man? What is he talking? He is a mad man. This is some other language. But if you see all the Sahaja Yogis they talk like this now.

Inka āgya pakḍā hai, inka pālanā pakḍā hai, yeh huā hai, woh huā hai. You will say what are they talking? Why they are turning their hands like this? Because the vibrations are flowing and they are using maneuvering their power. So, Kabira when he said anything, Nanak said anything, nobody understood what he was talking about. Time has come for you to rise to a certain height to understand that beyond this there is awareness in which you start feeling Him. That is how you enter into the kingdom of God. Where complete integration of your being takes place, first thing, you get collectively conscious. You get collectively conscious. Now I don't know how to put it in words that you understand the meaning.

You become collectively conscious. You are not so far. For example you can say yes, yes, I know he is a nice man. How do you say? Oh yes, I know he is alright. How do you know? Supposing you go to a doctor, he said alright I'll have to do some pathological test, I'll have to do this test and then I'll find out I'll take a test. But a Sahaja yogi can immediately say that this is the chakra which is caught and this is [unclear]. Your own power of yourself which exists in your heart is first time. Now this is very important.

The cell which is manifesting its power without your consciousness comes into your consciousness. The vibrations are nothing but the manifestation of your self which is [unclear/God]. And self is the reflection of God. Now the whole complicated engineering I've tried to make it simpler though whatever you may try it doesn't become simpler. Because engineering of this day, fan which is given as comfort, oh God what a headache it is to explain. But to have the comfort is better. Better to have it. Then we'll talk about the engineering. Complete I'll teach you. Everything.

Gopta, gopta taram, gopta tamam. The last word on all the secrets I'm going to tell you. Nothing is going to be kept up. But first of all you get your realization. Be nice children. As I always say I've done the cooking for you. So if you are hungry just have it. But do not have academic interest. Academic interest will create all these books. Good for nothing.

Padhi, padhi, pandit murakh bhai. No, no, no, no. If you have read too much also it's a problem for Kundalini. You know you have conception of God also. You have conception of everything. Let it happen to you. Once it happens to you then you see for yourself if it is so or not. Now the time has come. The blossom time has come. Many are going to get it.

But many won't be coming to Sahaja Yoga I can tell you. No they won't. Because I am a grahastha. They want a babaji, a lady like a babaji sitting here. She says you starve yourself for ten days. Then you give all your money to me. Of course that is first. Second time you starve yourself. Give your money to me. I am a babaji I have given up my house but I am taking your money.

I have given up my husband. All humbug. You are not to give up anything or to take anything. It's all myth. You have to be yourself. This is what Krishna tried to explain to Arjuna but he didn't understand it. At least you people understand it. Wherever you are you have to become yourself that's all. You are not to give up anything or to take anything or to do anything absurd. I am just like you because otherwise you would not listen to me.

I am a housewife. You know I have a husband, I have children, I have grandchildren. So called because you are my children too. And this is the thing meant for ordinary normal married people or people who are householders. Not for these Tanyasi Babas. No. All this tomfoolery is not here needed. You are the greatest people. Because you have children, you have parents, you know how to balance life, you are very balanced people. And it is going to act only in you and not in these extremists.

In India they call Bhagoras who has run away from the societies. There are some big big things you see. They are claiming I am this, I am that about you. I say what about you? Why don't you come down? Sitting in the Himalayas, sitting somewhere in the south, pondentially from there there is the right to be. Mother we know you have come and another one sitting down there in Gaganbaura. He says same, there another one sitting there. All claiming about me telling everybody who goes to them. Why don't you come down?

They say oh we don't want to face them. They are not going to crucify you. They haven't got that kind of patience. Oh they will take a chimta and hit you hard. Char chimte deya tam. He tells me also, they tell me also. It's a mother's job. It's just a mother's job and that's why it has to be a mother. As Indians you are very lucky to have good mothers. And that's what a mother is.

That she has to help you to get your realization. It is like one light which is enlightened the deeper has to enlighten other deeper. And then the another one that is enlightened has to enlighten another deeper. Let such Diwali be celebrated. It is your own power. It is your own thing. It is your own bati. It is your own oil. Only thing is the my light touches your light, you are enlightened. And then you enlighten another.

And this light also corrects the physical, the emotional and the mental being within you. All the conflicts are resolved and you become that. A detached soul. Today has been an introductory lecture I should say. I hope you have understood it. It's an invitation. You don't have to do anything. You don't have to worry. There are some people who are writing articles after articles about all these horrid people. And they said we don't want to see Mataji because we are afraid of her.

You are afraid of your mother. For a mother nobody is a sinner. Is there any sin which is greater than my love? I don't think. So please don't condemn yourself also. Just with open mind come and it will work out. It has worked with many, it is going to work out with you. We'll have some meditation for a while. We'll see how much it works out. There is nothing to be frightened of.

It's a wonderful experience and but the only thing is after getting it you must understand the mechanism behind it. Supposing today you don't get it, don't get worried. Maybe some physical problem is there. Maybe some emotional problem is there. Maybe something. We'll work it out. So far except for one person. It has been coming to me for last six years I have not been able to give him realization. Though he is a very learned man. I'm sorry but it is the only man exceptional I can tell you that I have not been able to give him realization or he has not achieved it.

But he is the only exceptional case otherwise everybody gets it. Only thing is that you have to stabilize it. The stabilization takes a little time and that is what is important. It stabilizes if you little bit practice the way of Sahaja Yoga. Faith is not needed but also denial is not needed. So you just sit with an open mind. Just with an open mind and it will work out. Now you should not worry what the Sahaja Yogis are going to do about you. They might touch your head because here it breaks out you know that. They may touch some of your chakras, may touch, may not touch.

They might give bandhan to that. They will work it out. It's something like this those who do not know how to swim are getting drowned. So those who know how to swim help the person to swim out. But the people who do not know how to swim have to keep quiet because they don't know. But once they learn it they can teach others. It is like this. It is going to work out that way and I hope all of you will have some experience tonight because I find the rate of realization is very fast. In the beginning for two years I have worked very hard and only twelve people got realization and here I now find that just like this it happens. While coming from Delhi I met somebody from Madras and he just came and touched my feet and he said, Mataji I am so lucky I am on this plane.

I was going by another plane. Can you give me your blessings? I said alright come along sit with me. And he got his realization within five minutes. Five minutes. It can happen. If there are any questions you better ask me because later on I don't want your buddhi to trouble you. This is it. But don't ask foolish questions. You see this is the real thing.

If you are genuinely interested you have it. Don't waste the time of others because there can be some negative people also just trying to waste our time. So don't waste it. If there is a sensible question just ask me. Because later on I don't want you people to feel that oh I didn't ask this question I should have asked this question. There is no need to ask questions. The children don't ask any question. They get it. But you should want. If there is any problem please ask.

Any problem that you have.
