Puja by the Krishna’s river, Brahmapuri (India) 1986-12-27

[English Transcript]

This is a special month in India and it is nice that we are organizing this program during this month. It is called as the Margashirsha, means where Marga means the road and Shirsha is the head, which leads (sounds like) you to the, to the epitome. That is the month and in this month they worship Guru because of his birthday Dattatreya and also they worship Mahalakshmi. That means this is the month of Sushumna, where the people get out of the bondages of smaller hankerings and enter into a new path of seeking of spirituality that is Sushumna that is Mahalakshmi. Also on this, there are lots of, (eh) pujas they do for four Thursdays, the puja of Mahalakshmi because Mahalakshmi is worshipped on a Thursday as it is the essence of the Guru principle. The Gurus have to satisfy the Mahalakshmi principle, which is just pure seeking of God, or what do you call the pure desire (“Shuddha Ichcha”).

Today is a Saturday as I enquired and the puja was done in Poona (“Pune”) was also (Shri Mataji is enquiring with someone in Marathi – “it happened on Friday or day before on Thursday?”) on Thursday. Thursday puja was the thing of the Mahalakshmi's puja had started. The day we did puja in Mahalakshmi, there you saw all, how the water was giving away its exuberance by putting up miraculous fountains and they became the clouds I believe because I heard at the time of the puja, rain started in Rahuri and it rained and rained and rained. And now this country which is under drought, people don't even have water to drink will have rain. So the whole thing works out according to the calendar which is devised by God, not by human beings. So today is a another day of Saturday, where we are sitting on the bank of Krishna river. See how it works out? Krishna River represents the power of Shri Krishna. So the Mahalakshmi essence (“Tattwa”) has to go to the Krishna state, of the witness state and that's how we are here today on this special occasion in Brahmapuri. Also the word Brahmapuri means where you feel the Brahma, the consciousness (“Chaitanya”) which you can feel on this river.

So when we are touring we are actually also internally, moving. Also there is inner unison (“Antar Yoga”) which you are achieving. So you should not mind little, little things here and there but enjoy every bit of it. Yesterday also I was happy you all danced because yesterday was the day, the day of Shakti, it was the Friday. On the day of Shakti if you dance you will get that power within yourself. And that's why you are looking much better now. (everyone laughing in the background). In my name if you dance you get the power, no doubt about it. And that's why here you are to achieve your spiritual power, your spiritual peace and your spiritual love. All these things if you can achieve in India you have done full justice to me and to yourself. It’s not just a picnic or an outing, nothing of the kind, and working out internally all of you, now I am sure it will work out.

So have loving attitude towards all the other people who are here, who are feeling lots of love for you and they pay lot of attention, they don't want you to do any hard work, they want to look after you but you also try to make friends and try to know them, hardly you know their names, hardly, eh, you write to them. That's not proper. So at least those who have been here many a times, should try to know the names of the people, take their addresses and they may also write to you and you may also write to them. So that you maintain a proper correspondence. So this relationship, of friendship and love must be started as Shri Krishna has said that unless and until you love each other, I do not exist within you. So it’s not only one country, it’s not many countries, it's all the countries of the world have to love each other and to understand each other as yogis. You are all yogis and to be appreciated. They have been always, already singing the praises of you since long and now it is time to prove it.

The other day I described to them the procession that was described by one of the English poets in his vision he saw our procession and when I told them they are very happy that already an English poet like Lewis could see these points and written in such details the whole description. But that book has not arrived in India, Vision, is a beautiful book and I would request the Australians to, if possible to make some copies of that and hand it over, at least the typed copies, in Satara or in Sangli somehow if you have the book with you and give it to them. They will be very happy to know all about it. That will be a special present to the people of Ganapatipule. If you could give the exact, eh, book then somebody can do it in Satara and can do it in one day in India. These things can be done very easily in India. We don't book things as you have to book. We have started but not so much of booking is here. So I would request you to do that much, give the book to these people so they will bring it printed and everybody can have it.

[Marathi to English translation]

Shri Mataji speaking to someone “Get one thousand copies of the book, I will give the money for it.”

Now these guests have come here to us and they have told me repeatedly that, please thank them all profusely on our behalf and we are very grateful (“anugrahith”) to them and are thankful (“aabhari”) to them. In this regard I have told them many times that I convey this in Marathi, but you talk to them and express the same and they will feel very good. And also get to know them, become friends with them, know their names, so that they will also feel good about it that the peasant community (“khedo padhi”) are our brothers. We are all tied to one source (“sutra”). You may be from any country, wherever you are, even then you all are my children. So, you should not have any discrimination amongst yourselves, you all should be friends with each other. Also, each one of you should know each other, who is how and what they are. Now to say that today’s day is special, it is a Saturday on the banks of River Krishna, means Shri Krishna’s empire (“samrajya”) seems to have begun and in this empire of his you have kept this puja. Actually, there is nothing to say in a puja because the consciousness (“Chaitanya”) flows by itself and drenches you. Then only that consciousness you have to assimilate (take in) within yourself. The speciality of Sahaja Yoga is that you have to meditate (“dhyandharana”) in this. If you do not meditate then you will not be able to adjust in Sahaja Yoga. Hence, you have to take some time out to meditate and you will be able to know about your faults only in the meditation. You should not hang on to your faults, you should get rid of it and after you get rid of it, you will be able to reap the benefits, you will be surprised that so many miracles will happen in your life and you will be able to tell about the same to others as well. Today Brahmapuri is looking special and in that so many people have come from other countries, the name has spread across the world. So the thing that we felt was so small, one that Shri Ramadas Swamy was spoken about (“gajalele hote”) only in Maharashtra, now is spoken about in the whole world, Sant Tukaram’s songs (“abhanga”) are now being sung everywhere, they take the name (“namasmaran”) of Sant Namadeo, means from where we have reached where. Means the stature (“putal mahiti”) of Maharashtra has reached there, its glory (“mahima”) has reached all is worth noting and how appreciative (“kautuk”) they are about it is worth noting. Otherwise who recognises someone else in this country, no one recognises the other. If you ask someone from North of India, who Sant Ramadas was, then they don’t know anything, who was Shivaji Maharaj they don’t know, that is the state. In such a scenario, the name of Maharashtra has been noted (“nonda”) and from there people have come to visit you (“darshana la aaley”), you need to think that they have come to see the saints (“sadhu” and “sant”). Like we call (“pacharan”) the saints (“sadhu” and “sant”) and behave with them, in a similar way we have to behave with everyone with love. And they have brought lots of gifts for you and they are thinking of giving it to you in Ganapatipule. So everyone should come to Ganapatipule, whoever can should come, it is not that far off from here. If you feel like, come for three days or come for five days and you will be charged only for your food and stay and there are no other special expenses that needs to be paid. At least there are fifty or fifty one marriages that have been fixed, I don’t know if we will have more than that and if you do the calculations, you will be contributing a maximum of six annas (less than a rupee) as gift for these marriages, it doesn’t seem so significant. Even then you should come with sweet binding of joy and it is only once that you will have such a fun gathering (“parvani”). Suppose we have to go anywhere, if you have to go on a tour, we spend so much. So Shri Mataji has made beautiful arrangements, you all should come there, be happy in your mind (“mana sobat”) and you should enjoy yourselves. You should not start picking holes (“kinmisha”), you should come with love. This is my request to you all.
