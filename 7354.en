Public Program Day 2, Sydney (Australia), 17 April 1991.

Begins at 40:55

I bow to all the seekers of Truth. You have been already told about these centers within us. Their qualities and these three channels which constitute them. But one may ask why all this instrument plays within us? With what purpose? And why evolution has to go further? The reason is you have to now become the spirit. Go beyond your physical, emotional, mental being and become the spirit. Because spirit is the reflection of God Almighty and spirit is the universal being within you. When you become the spirit, you become a universal being. You become a universal being, doesn't mean that you take a certificate that you are a universal being. Not at all. But this state of being a universal being is manifested in you. It is manifested as a innate knowledge within you. As you have innate knowledge of colors now. You know this is this color, this is this color. You see it. In the same way, you become aware of you being a universal being. Means a microcosm becomes the microcosm. Again I say becomes. It's not just a feeling that you have become. Like a drop becomes the ocean. But again it's not just a mental understanding, but it is a happening. And this happening takes place and you become a personality which leaves your boundaries, limitations and you start seeing yourself as a very loving, affectionate, compassionate personality. When a child is born to a mother, she feels tremendous love for the child. From where does she get this love? Is innately built within her and her love becomes doubled. Whatever love she had for herself starts flowing towards her child. But when you become a universal being, then your compassion takes a very universal personality. Then you do not think that you are an Australian or you are a Englishman or an Indian. But you just think that we are part and parcel of one universal personality. Now this feeling sometimes can be confusing the word is, feeling means I feel very happy, I feel very unhappy. It's all a mental projection but it becomes part and parcel of your awareness. This is the point I want to make very clearly to you. That it becomes just an awareness of collective consciousness. Then you can't avoid it, you can't just get rid of it. As you feel for your family. Why do you feel? I mean some even don't feel that. But most of you feel for your family, for your children, for your wives, for your brothers, sisters, father, mother. So why do you feel for them? Because you have expanded your personality. So you just feel it. But when your personality is that expanded, then the whole world seems to be your family, your relations. Then you do not see a person superficially skin deep but you see a person as a part and parcel of your being. Not only that but as you can feel your own chakras on your fingertips, you can feel the chakras of another person on your fingertips. And then if you know how to correct, you can correct those centers and correct their problems. Today I'll just deal with one chakra. How when one chakra goes out of order, what happens to us? It's very interesting to find out how we suffer from so many diseases because of one Center. This Center is the second center of Swadishthana. Second center of the Swadishthana is attached to the nabhi the third Center and moves round the whole of that green area. It can go to the end to the periphery or it can be anywhere. And the duty of this Center is mainly to convert the fat cells for the use of the brain. That medical science doesn't know. The other functions are to look after the liver, to look after the pancreas, to look after the spleen, the kidneys and the intestines. So when we start thinking too much, when we become futuristic, we start planning everything, I mean. Sometimes people plans so much, that you don't know where you are left with that plan and that planning gives you a turbulent mental exertion and you need more energy for your cells in the brain. So this has to pass as you see here clearly, it has to pass into your brain, the energy. But when you think too much and plan too much and if you are successful, then you develop an institution called ego, which is a big yellow pile in your head. That's not only thing but as you start thinking too much, you neglect all these viscera’s, all these organs in the viscera. And thus you have very big problems of health to begin with. Of course when you neglect your liver, you know liver is they say, you will live till your liver will allow. Now this liver has to clean all the poison from your body. It comes out as heat and is delivered to the bloodstream. But when this is neglected, this poor liver doesn't know how to function without the energy and all the heat is accumulated in the liver. So a person suffers from liver trouble and the symptoms are he gets migraine. He cannot see the Sun, then also he gets very hot-tempered, irritable, angry because there is so much of heat. Then this heat passes, I was telling in Canberra, most of the bureaucrats have this problem. Because they plan too much. And what will you do with that planning, God alone knows. So then this heat passes upward and downward. So when it passes downward, it gives you a very bad problem of terrible constipation because the heat constricts your intestine, large intestines. It also coagulates your kidneys, by which you have kidney trouble, you cannot pass your urine. Then you go on the dialysis and you are certified as really dead because you cannot last longer. It’s a very expensive treatment but doctors do not tell you frankly that oh you are not going to live. Then this heat can pass upward, and when it goes upward, it goes say to your right heart as shown there. As a result of that you develop asthma. Of course astham is connected also with the left side. So when this triggering done by the left side, then you get this horrible disease called asthma. Then this heat can go upward and can ruin your throat. It can freeze your right arm. It can make your left eye red and also your left ear deaf but by chance if such a person is young and using too much physical energy and mental energy as well as drinking a lot, he can have a very fatal heart attack, a very massive one. And he may die very early in age. You must know that all such attacks at a young age always are fatal. But when you see to the other side is that there is a pancreas which is neglected. As a result of the neglect of the pancreas, you develop a disease called diabetes. Even the mothers who are extremely planning type and thinking type give that disease to their children and children are born with diabetes. Then you have the third problem with the spleen. This is the most dangerous one. Nowadays as the life is, we are all time bound. Very particular about time. As a result of that, we have become extremely hectic. Suppose you sleep very late in the night, then you have to get up early in the morning somehow. Somehow get into your clothes and run to the office. Don't even take your breakfast. Your wife will give you. So on the way in the car you are eating your breakfast. And then you read the newspaper, you get a shock of your life because so many horrible things are happening. Newspapers will never give something that is good or is doing well but something that has gone wrong to be a sensational feeling. It is sometimes horrible things. So early in the morning, if you read something horrible, being a human being, you are sometimes shocked. Then you find there is a jam on the way and you get so upset and all your peace is disturbed. Now this spleen is responsible for creating red blood corpuscles when you are in emergency. You must have seen when you eat your food and you run you get a pain here. That's because your spleen is trying to pump out new RBCs. Now to create that, poor this spleen has to work very hard but it cannot understand the crazy hectic personality. Every time it tries to cope with it, it goes crazy. So such a spleen becomes crazy and ultimately with some triggering on the left-hand side, you develop a horrible disease called as leukaemia or blood cancer. Then also your intestinal problems, the pain in the stomach and all that's indigestion, all go hand-in-hand only because of one center only on the right side. I have not even described the left side center. So if I describe all these, then the whole material medica will be described. It's like that. So all the permutations and combinations of these centers give you physical problems, then the left side gives you the mental problem. Now when the Kundalini rises, as I told you, She pierces through these centers, and like pearls, they-it passes through different pearls. The left hand side, right hand are brought together and are nourished and that's how you feel all right, your health is all right. So when the Kundalini rises and when She touches the spirit, the seat of the spirit here, the flow of the grace also on the sympathetic nervous system relaxes your center and nourishes them. Plus the rising of the Kundalini helps you such a lot but unless and until you get awakening of your Kundalini and the last breakthrough of the last Center, you cannot feel all right. And you have to work it out in a proper way, understanding the how to cure yourself or how to cure others. You have to also know how to protect yourself but you definitely become a personality who can cure people, who can cure themselves, I mean Sahaja Yogis, don't go to doctors at all. I've no question. As soon as they get into trouble, they know this burning started, now this is it, clear it out. They are the doctors, they get the diagnosis, they know the medicine – finished. So the first thing that happens to us that physically you feel perfect. After that you don't age also, your age comes down. You don't have wrinkles, you don't have worries because all your worries are due to your left side or right side which is causing you to institutions of ego or super-ego. But when they're open out and when the Kundalini is out, then like a, I should say like an opening of a chimney, the whole of this worrying and tension and all that passes out. And you have no tension, you are absolutely peaceful with yourself. You are peaceful with others. You're serene and you get all your centers integrated. Now this is a very big achievement because I feel these days it is not the problem of political differences thanks to Gorbachev – who is a realized soul himself but the main problem now is of fundamentalism. Because everybody thinks that they are on the right path. Thank God I was born in a Christian family – just imagine you are worshipping Christ. And how can it be that your eyes are going round and round and round like that because that Christ is deciding on your optic chiasma. That's why He said you'll be calling me Christ-Christ and I won't recognize you. He has also said those who are not against me, are with me. So who are those? We should not be fundamentalist and try to find out who are those, who are with Christ and who are not. I mean the horrible things we have done, of course let’s said the better about Him the religion also. Where it is said that in every human being, we have the spirit and every human being is the Temple of the Spirit. Still we have a horrible thing called caste system in India. When Shri Rama ate the fruits from a very old lady of an aboriginal land, who had eaten them and seen that they are not sour because He may not like sour food. And He really was so happy to eat them. He made it, I mean His life was written by a person called Valmiki, who was a dacoit then he got his transformation and he was born in a very low caste, if you want to think from modern angle as a fisherman. Same thing with Shri Krishna, his life was written, Gita was written by Vyasa, who was the illegitimate child of a fisherwoman. Illegitimate child. So you can see how these people have tried to show in their own life that is not important as to what work you do or what calling you have, is what is important is how pure you are. What level of spirituality you are. We have in India schedule (?) casting in so many of them. And we have all kinds of saints in our country. And one saint has said that what's the use of me becoming a Brahmin, calling myself a Brahmin when I don't know what is Brahma is. This himself is condemning himself. Then another one saying thank God I have become a Shidule (?) cast, because I do not oppress others. All the Saints have said the same thing because they were integrated within himself. They could see that all religions, all prophets, all great incarnations, all of them were born on one tree of spirituality and we stupidly take away those flowers, those dead flowers and say this is ours, this is ours, this is ours. So today's problem is fundamentalism and this fundamentalism is working in everyone. Muslims are actually I would say, are, they have no finesse, that's why it's obvious but Christians have greed finesse you see. They are also extremely fundamentalist and the way we are doing things, we should be shocked. I recently read a book called Vatican connections in which they showed the Vatican published two billion dollars of counterfeit securities and sold them through mafia. Can you imagine two billion dollars and in London, if you live, you will feel like running away from Church of England because people are saying Christ was homosexual. He had bad relations with his mother. All kinds of horrible things that one cannot bear, they are talking and Church of England is sleeping and now they are appointing the clergyman or I would say the people priests who are homosexuals. Then the other day, I read that they were women in America were warned that do not go for ordain-ordination because the clergymen will harass you. Are they clergymen or what? How can they teach about God if they are like that? But once you get your self-realization, the Hindu start seeing the bad points among themselves, Christians start seeing the bad points among themselves and also the Muslim starts. And you'll be surprised the Jews now worship Christ in Sahaja Yoga. We have many Jews in Sahaja Yoga and they all worship Christ and we have Sahaja Yoga Center even in Israel because they see that He was the truth. But when you are fundamentalist, you do not want to accept anything. You put the blinkers and mostly this business, any one of them is nothing but business. The false gurus are business, also these people who talk of religion also cannot think that they are dulling the spirituality of people. That everybody has this feeling to rise. This integration you get in the light of the Spirit. Because as soon as you put your hands to anyone, say Khalil Gibran, say Muhammad Sab himself. You ask a question, was Muhammad Sab the incarnation of the primordial master? Immediately you'll start feeling tremendous vibration that He was, whatever one may say about Him. But He was. They may say anything about Christ, nonsense but you ask any question, any one of you who are realized Souls, was Christ the incarnation of innocence? Was He the son of God? Immediately you start feeling vibrations but if there is a false guru, a false personality, a false man, you ask the question and immediately you will feel the heat. Sometimes even the burning from that person. This is how you know the absolute Truth about any person, about any situation, about any book or any kind of ideologies. Whether it is truth or not, only can be verified and judged through your vibrations because there is spirit flowing through. There are many people who are just mercenary, working for money, doing all kinds of nonsensical things but ultimately you develop that personality of self-respect within you and you think what am I doing? Is this the way? Even that thinking is not required. We just drop that all nonsense. I know people who have dropped their jobs which were mercenary, which were the wrong type of jobs, in the mafias and all that, they have come to Sahaja Yoga. And now they have proper, sensible dignified jobs. So the whatever we have lost, comes back to us because now we know ourselves in the light of our spirit. And we become really so powerful that now we can bear any amount of money given to us, we are not attracted. Any amount of power given to us, we are not attracted. Any amount of promises or anything, we are not bothered because we have risen above all these things and we can see very clearly that what is most important is our spirituality, our virtues and we start enjoying our virtues. People always talk about peace-peace formations. I've seen those people because of my husband who have been given Nobel Prizes and all that but they have no peace within themselves. I don't know how they get these prizes, just to have them outside going around, peace foundation. Peace is within yourself. Those who do not have this within themselves, how can they spread peace? How can they give peace to others? But once you get your realization, you become a peaceful personality but greatest above all, the spirit is the source of pure knowledge. Absolute knowledge, pure knowledge about anything. So immediately because it is in your awareness, you know what is the correct thing to do. What is the righteousness. How to be on the right path? Because you also get the strength to be on the right path. You have that strength. You become a powerful personality. You remember Christ standing before Mary Magdalene and He said that those who think have not committed a sin, can throw a stone at her and everybody stood back. But He said just throw the stone at me. He didn't say at her. He said throw the stone at me. What a courage? After all, what has got a saint to do with the prostitute? Nothing. But his courage because He-they are not afraid of anyone but for God. And they are not afraid, it's the respectful or for God that they have. So this is the state we have to achieve of such personality but your attention itself gets enlightened. This is the best part of it. A person who has really evolved to that state, even a glance of this person can cure someone, can bring peace to someone, can satisfy someone. Even a glance. So such a personality is quite potential in all of you. You all can achieve that potential because you are seekers of truth and the truth is nothing but the light of the Spirit and once you have that light, you can have that kind of a consciousness, that wherever you put your attention, that problem gets solved, that person is helped. International problems can be solved also if collectively you think of any problem like that. If a person is very troublesome to you, you can just put a protection on him and you'll be amazed, he will change. He'll be kind to you because your love acts, your compassion acts through your attention. The last, the most important thing that happens to you, that you drop into the ocean of joy. Joy has no duality, it is not happiness, unhappiness. That comes through ego. But joy is the state where you are enjoying everything. You do not react to anything. Just see everything and you are in the ocean of joy. So what is the question of getting sick or getting bored. You are never bored, when you are alone or where-whether you are with others. You enjoy because there's joy within you and the source of joy is the spirit. Thus you become the spirit. This is the status you achieve. It can be achieved very easily but for human beings to eat food like, is very difficult. He has to go round his head and eat it. So, whatever is simple, is real. Whatever is complicated, is unreal. It is so widely (?) today for you to get your realization, that it works in such a simple manner. So don't listen to anybody who tells you to go on chanting for hours together. As I’ve seen this poor Buddhist going on like that spoiling this throat, getting cancer. You must have first seen many people like that, chanting-chanting-chanting-chanting, mad. See! You are not connected with God. See what is this, the telephone is out of order but where are you telephoning? It's stupid to do that way but you'll find there’s a Hare Rama's now, there are so many who came to us are suffering from cancer of the throat you know. And then said chant-chant-chant-chant, you say, they start chanting any name, it takes you away. It's very dangerous because Shiva gets very angry you see. Now supposing you have to meet the Queen of England and you go and start shouting Elizabeth-Elizabeth-Elizabeth, the police will arrest you there. You must have some protocol. You should be able to enter into-the-into-the protocol and you have to be in the Kingdom of God. Then even once you think of God, you are blessed. Don't have to go on pestering Him like this as if He's in your pocket. Just take out your pocket telephone, go on like that. All this is nonsense and once they do all these chanting business, I have seen they put some sort of a spirit in you, they just mesmerize you, then you don't know what's happening. The other day, we had three, four people complaining they went to some lady where they had paid lot of money and now they have got pain in the stomach, they've got pain in the heart. I mean at least your health should be looked after. There should be some concern about it. So one has to understand this kind of madness must be (?). People I've seen, even Christians, pray sometimes, they break their heads, they shout at God, they say all kinds of things when the God is not listening to them. What’s the use of doing all this? Prayer is only possible after you have got connection. Otherwise there's no use praying to God because you are not connected and that's why Christ has said you are to be born again. Everybody has said, Muhamad Sab has said that you have to be, every-everyone has said that. Now if you just ask for it, you can get your realization tonight but after that you have to remember that this is not an individual thing, that you sit at home and say all right I am doing this meditation this way, it's not going to work out. You have to be collective, you have to meet each other wherever there is the program is or whatever it is. Like a nail which is cut out is-will never grow. So you have to be attached to the body of Sahaja Yogi's. Also you have to spread. You have to spread Sahaja Yoga. When you spread Sahaja Yoga, you will go deeper and deeper and deeper and then you discover you and Divinity and you will know how glorious you are. How great you are and why are you here? To do the work of God. To be an absolute beautiful instrument into His hand. May God bless you all.

(Audience applause)

Shri
Mataji continues: Yesterday we have had too many questions I
think and I think today we could have very few because yesterday's
questions I am very good at answering you know because I have been
answering for the last twenty years now so I’ve become quite an
expert and I know all the styles and types there are but this is a
mental feed only. This is only at mental activity. What I want that
you should not have any obstruction of your mind when you are
meditating, that's why I say just ask the question but if you just go
on like that, then it's just a mental level and it is no guarantee
that if I answer to your questions, that you definitely get your
realization. On the contrary, mental activity should be less. It's
better that you should leave mental activity for tomorrow and you
won't have much tomorrow. So ask questions which are relevant. I’ve
told you yesterday that I am not here to take anything from you. I am
here to give you the key of your own benevolence by which you will
have deeper faith in whatever you have been doing, like supposing you
are Christian, you will know what Christ is and also you will know
what other great incarnations were. Your knowledge will expand. Even
the children who come to Sahaja Yoga have become so intelligent that
most of the scholarships they bag. They pass their highest
examination in record time. It's something surprising that when the
Kundalini goes into the head how one becomes so alert, so active, at
the same time so compassionate. So I would request you to understand
the value of your being, your self-realization and don't waste your
energy into something frivolous but pay little attention to your
self-realization and then next year I'll be here to see great masters
of Sahaja Yoga sitting here. You all have to become your own masters,
that's what I want to see. So any question there? Those who have been
yesterday asking questions need not ask and those who are new, I must
say they were must at least listen to my yesterday's lecture. So they
shouldn't ask about yesterday but today's things if they think,
whatever it is, I mean I am willing to answer. 

MC:
Questions?

Lady
in audience: (inaudible)

MC:
What is your method of self-realisation?

Shri
Mataji: That you will see now. It's spontaneous. It's like a seed
being sprouted. It's a living process, of a living energy, which
spontaneously act. 

Man
in audience: (inaudible)

MC:
Once you have gained this new sense of consciousness, how do you stop
repeating the things that you have done in the past and would rather
not do again?

Shri
Mataji: I didn’t follow this.

MC:
Once you have got your realization, how does one stop doing things
that are against our better nature?

Shri
Mataji: You mean usual habits?

MC:
Yeah.

Shri
Mataji: I see. See once you get your realization, as I told you
yesterday, a simile, that you are holding a snake.

1:21:10

is this this works out best this simile works out best and it is all darkness and you are all blind can't see it till the snake bites you won't leave the snake because we say it's a rope whatever one may tell you so if you are not right and if there is little light you'll immediately throw it away that's what overnight you'll be surprised overnight people have given up drugs overnight many many people and alcoholism so many bad habits overnight and myself amazed how powerful they are I didn't say anything don't do this don't do that I've never said what they have done it because you are powerful within yourself what the thing is like this instrument has to be connected to the mains you have to be connected to the mains then it starts working what happens to ones comma after yourself realized yeah you see you see you have the ego the yellow one and the blue one the yellow one is the ego that that saves me I have done this work and that and we think this is our karma animals don't think that animals do whatever they have to do and they are bound by God's love and they never feel they have done bad Karma's of what Karma's they never count that we are the ones because we have got a consciousness by which we say this is bad karma this is good Karma's and all that in our ego it is said to them and the another one is the conditioning on the left-hand side so when the Kundalini passes through uruguaya through the optic chiasma then she sucks in these two she sucks in your Karma's and also your sons Cara's means York conditioning and it opens out your liberating so the Karma's are finished was for why does evil exist is it a contrast for good evil is created by human beings not by God because God has given us freedom to go to hell or to heaven this freedom had to be given at certain stage because ultimately they have enjoyed the complete freedom like in school you are taught 2+2 but then you are given little freedom in the college to find out for yourself so that you are ultimately free to teach that's why this freedom was given and many have sought for evil things what can you do about I cannot take away freedom God won't take away your freedom it is there in your freedom you have to seek the truth is it dangerous to raise the Kundalini without yogic training not at all Kundalini is your mother she is your individual mother she knows everything about you and she's like a deep recorder she knows your past she knows everything what you have been and what you have to be when you were born your mother took all the labor pains upon her Salou herself in the same way this loving mother takes all the pains upon herself there are books and books I know who have said that Kundalini awakening is very difficult it gives you this pain that pain and all that but I don't know how they write this under what authority maybe if you go and put your hands fingers in through the plug and then say this hall is horrible this hall gives you shocks because they have tried something which is very wrong that may be the reason this must have happened but Kundalini when she Rises she rises in her own majesty not only that but she Rises comforting you looking after she knows what's your problem is she knows her child very well so don't listen to these people they have written all these books because perhaps they don't want you to get realization that's the only way you can get realization how can that be lets's if God is the only power the only reality how can we have power and they liver get disease see God is not like Rock of Gibraltar right god is the power and he has even as powers if he had not given his powers he could not have talked even would not have stood up he gives power to us slowly and steadily till you become a human being and now the last power is the spiritual power he is the source of all we have so many lights here how do they get the power when there is only one power house let's just say so if we get this this realization tonight then what do we do with it that of course is very easy we have got beautiful ashrams and centers in your Sydney we have follow on where you have to go they'll tell you what is to be done and also you'll be told about everything that you want of course free of charge you don't have to pay at all there's nothing like intensive and all that in sahaja yoga and everything available to you everything this knowledge is all going to be available to you free of charge but you must give some time yes and in this light when you are realized Souls the subtle knowledge you know so fast I myself surprised how the people who have never even heard of word of Kundalini have become such experts in one one time I would say now we'll have can you see me there up there you can see me all of you so now we have the session for self-realization which will take 10 to 15 minutes so first thing I have to request you to please take out your shoes if you don't mind and you are not to leave for these 10-15 minutes if you want to go out for a while you can go and come back because it's 10-15 minutes you have to be there so you can just go I'll wait for five minutes you can go if you want to go and then come back one song with respect to this they have no Kundalini still not online they'll come back after five minutes sometimes for such a long time they've been sitting [Music] there are two persons it is time all right now please take out your shoes both your shoes and put your both the field at a distance from each other because as I as can you fix this up a little you see falls off now is better because the left and the right are two energies as you know the left is the energy of desire and the Kundalini is the energy of pure desire so you have to put your left hand towards me like this keeping on your lap now the right hand is the carrier of the energy of action so we have to use the right hand to nourish our centers one by one on the left hand side before we start we'll show you these centers which we have to nourish on the left-hand side with your right hand very simple so first of all you put your right hand on your heart and left hand towards me then you have to put your hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side heart is the award of your spirit while this is the center of your mastery which is created by great masters then you have to put your hand in the row portion of your abdomen on the left hand side this is the center of pure knowledge pure knowledge which manifests on your central nervous system which gives you the power to work it off the divine laws then you raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen again then on your heart and then in the corner of your neck and your shoulder this is the center we catch or squat when we feel guilty and is a very dangerous Center because it gives you diseases like angina also spondylitis and the troubles that arise from lethargic organs so please hold it tight here and then turn your head to our right now you have to take your right hand onto your forehead across put down your head only this is the center for forgiving everyone you have to now take your hand back side of your head push back your head fully upward without feeling guilty without counting your mistakes you have to ask forgiveness from the divine power now you have to stretch your hand stretch your palm and put the center of your palm on top of your fontanel bone area which was a soft bone in your childhood now push back your fingers by pushing back your fingers you put a good pressure on your scar now put down your head put down your head and push back your fingers and now move your scalp slowly seven times clockwise that's what we have to do but now there are two conditions which you have to fulfill otherwise the kundalini may not reach its destination the first one is that you have to forgive everyone you have to forgive everyone altogether in general you may say it is very difficult to forgive so many say like that I'm drawing there's nothing to try it's a myth whether you forgive or don't forgive you don't do anything but if you don't forgive then you play into wrong hands and those who are troubled you got tortured you you are torturing yourself instead they are having a good time so best thing is that you forgive each and every person without thinking about them individually but just say I forgive all of them all together now this is very very important very important because this Center which is the optic chiasma is like that absolutely closed unless you forget it won't open is the greatest weapon you have got is to forgive to get rid of all the headaches just you have to forget please remember you have to forgive yesterday I had to work on so many people because they had not forgiven that's why I'm saying the first condition normally I say is the second condition but I think the foremost condition is to forgive and with a surprisingly those who are Christians should forgive anyone they are the worst as far as Felipe's consulate I find you have to forgive please forgive everyone just say just say it's a myth just meet right it's a myth so please forgive everyone now the second condition is that you have to forget your past and you have to be in the present means you should know that you are not will chat all forget about your mistakes now don't feel guilty now say with full faith in yourself that you are not guilty at all because if you do not say that this horrible Center will stop your Kundalini and it is very much sketchy yesterday also today also you feel extremely guilty I don't know why there is no need to feel guilty if you think you have done mistakes just face it finished but not to feel guilty it's very important again I request you do not feel guilty at all always I said this was the first condition but I think forgiveness is the best first of all and second is that you know that you are not guilty at all because this divine power is the ocean of forgiveness it is so powerful that whatever mistakes you might become anything it forgives you completely dissolves all your mistakes it's very powerful so have faith in it because you shouldn't stop your realization because of that so I request you again and again that please forgive yourself and forgive others so that you do not feel guilty and that you do not think of all these horrible people who have troubled you just forgive them now I would like to assure that you are all capable of getting realization so do not have any diffidence about it do not think that you cannot get it do not doubt yourself by any chance have full confidence in yourself and it will work on because Kundalini is the power of theö desire and if you have that desire whether you are aware or not it will work so I am again requesting you that have full confidence in yourself you have to now close your eyes before that you can take out your spectacles because it can help your eyesight also now please put your left hand towards me like this those who are sitting on the ground can sit with normal way there's no need to put both the feet on the ground

freedom and I cannot force you to have pure knowledge you have to ask for it so please take your hand into the lower portion of your abdomen and press it hard on the left-hand side here the center has got six petals so you have to ask in your freedom for pure knowledge so please say six times mother please give me pure knowledge [Music] as soon as you ask for pure knowledge Kundalini starts rising
