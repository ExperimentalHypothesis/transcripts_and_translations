Birthday Felicitations, Kolkata (India), 19/03/1993

I’m very much thankful to Anandhata Kalsensap [unsure] President. Today, he told Me, in the play, about us, the shraddha we have, which is so much needed in our life. 
And I know it is in Bengal that people are going to give you something great about art.
 
0:53
Some or other, here, when people made this great scene, there has been such a big manifestation of artists and art of great heritage. 
Firstly, the models [unsure] are extremely devotional, lovable, loving people. They are not materialists; they care more for comedians and for the human feelings. 
As I’ve told you always, the greatest artist that I know was Shakti Nitamudhin [??] who was the one who just catch your heart and make you understand and kept this [??] he has got [??]  And his art of acting is so beautiful as if he understands human beings and their problems and how with love you can solve them. 
2:08
Sahaja, it is very closed absolutely there, with the art any of it, because it is the expression of the heart.  When the imagination of an artist reaches the reality, then that artist becomes sahaj, automatically. We have had many artists like that [??] who have through their imagination reached the reality, the depth of reality. And that has brought all the releases [unsure] by which they can cure many things which we cannot cure with analyses: social problem, politic problems. Any kind of problems of creativity or Indian gurdate [unsure] which look so formidable, have shown their delicate branch, or we can call it, their delicate writings. You can solve these problems and the solutions that have come through many artists, it’s something very remarkable. 
 
Of course, drama plays a very big part in our the cultural life. It’s coming from ancient times I mean, they say that the drama has started in India. 
 
3:45
When Arjuna was going for a war, his wife asked him to be a [??] means what you do is a – the control of an artist which acts, with the text sometimes or some other mechanism. So this is the first sign that there was, in this country, great artists who used to act like - sometimes like [??] or sometimes like [??] at the time of Arjuna. 
4:36
So this acting has started in our country long time back. The greatest thing about an artist for which I have always [??] their nature, apart from they will catch your heart, that they are bred Indian, culture Indian is, they cannot take to any other culture [??] Whether an artist [??] doesn’t matter, even the little girls are [??].
So it is seldom that it comes here, it’s really a great privilege [??] to get a look at an upper plan of our arts. Otherwise, we are getting a very cheap type of artist in the pictures in our country. 5:23
We have taken to something that ?? the art, some sort of a- we can call- an acrobatic show that we have on the stage by which we think that we are great [??] who act. 
 
5:40
All this kind of nonsense has come and is still coming in our main cities, also in our films, and this nonsense has to be outwitted by real art 
And I’m very happy that we have this [??] here which we definitely [??]  the real sense of expression of their manifestation of joy, of happiness, unhappiness, and all the things that they have been facing. 
6:19
It’s a kind of emotion, it is a thing, I would say, is [inaudible]
6:30
Rama, first of all, who was such a mighty person, but he went in the forest to save Sitaji. If you call it an epic or drama whatever it is, his way expresses a person who believes in truth, believes in honesty, believes in the respect of a women, who fights, such a man –??? will be lost because  he’s so mighty and gets hurts [unsure], but he fights and in that fight, he gets very badly injured. 
7:15
For example, that [Hinduni? inaudible] was there till Shri Rama and he lives with the moksha to show that all his sufferings are finished once you’ve got moksha.
In this world, you don’t have to worry. You’ll have to get the joy won’t have to fight. But in a way, there is a big fight within yourself. And that fight is that when we want to see ourselves as something really egoistical, and then we start fighting with our ego and [??] which is the feeling of righteousness. This righteousness get injured [??] no doubt.
 
Now Sahaja Yoga has come to show that you don’t have to fight, you have just to ask for your Realization. It is the time that has brought this for you. I know I should have [inaudible]  anybody could have done who [inaudible].
So it has happened and so you have already your moksha, so many Sahaja Yogis have achieved it and enjoy the drama much more than any thing else [unsure]. Because they will realize that they have that, they have to stay with themselves for their seeking. And ultimately they got their Realization. And this will definitely give you a greater hope that we can spread Sahaja Yoga all over.
 
Art is a part and parcel of a human being, it’s the potential of a human being. We have to develop art because Sahaja Yoga is nothing but to be enjoyed with [inaudible]. And if you do not have art, what will you enjoy? But it has to be pure art. 
The meaning [unsure] is important and as you will see today, art in India has [inaudible].
 
I hope in the country where you got born for the Spirit and that culture can be? It has come here all the way from Kolkata and you can become very good intermediate of a true artist of true arts.    
I’m sure you’ll enjoy. I’m thankful to all of them for organizing this beautiful drama for all of you to see and enjoy. As the mantra for tonight is that you all enjoy, that’s what it is.
May God bless you all
