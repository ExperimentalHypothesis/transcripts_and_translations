Birthday Felicitations, Kolkata (India), 19/03/1993

I’m very much thankful to Anandhata Kala sangam President. Today, he told Me, in the play, about us, that shraddha we have, which is so much needed in our life.
And I know it is in Bengal, people are going to really give you something great about art.

Somehow or other, here, where River Ganges makes this great scene, there has been such a big manifestation of artists and art of Indian heritage.
Firstly, the models are extremely devotional, lovable, loving. They are not materialists; they care more for human beings and for the human feelings.
As I’ve told you always, the greatest novelist that I've ever known was Shakti Nitamudhin [unsure] who was the one who would just catch your heart and make you understand in every subject he has dealt and his art of writing is so beautiful as if he understand human being and their problems and how with love you can solve them.

Sahaja, it is very close absolutely there, with the art, any of it, because it is the expression of the heart. When the imagination of an artist reaches the reality, then that artist becomes sahaj, automatically. We have had many artists like that, poets, who have through their imagination reached the reality, the depth of reality. And that has brought all the releases [unsure] by which they can cure many things which you cannot cure with analyses: social problems, politic problems, any kind of problems of creativity or Indian gurdate [unsure] which look so formidable, have shown their delicate brush, or we can call it, their delicate writings. You can solve these problems and the solutions that have come through various arts, it’s something very remarkable.

Of course, drama plays a very big part in our cultural life. It’s coming from ancient times I mean, they say that the drama and acting has started in India. When Arjuna was going for a war, his wife asked him to be a [??] means what you do is a – I don’t know in English how to say it but a- you can call [?] of an artist which acts, with the text sometimes or some other mechanism. So this is the first sign that there were, in this country, great artists who used to act sometimes like, sometimes like pantomimes or sometimes like a dramatist [?] at the time of Arjuna.

So this acting culture started in our country long time back. The greatest thing about an artist for which I have always praised about their nature, apart from they will catch your heart, that they are bred Indian, cultured Indians, they cannot take to any other culture ritualism- where the women are respected, it doesn’t matter, even the little girls are [??].
So it is seldom that it comes here, it’s really a great privilege [??] for the upliftment of our art. Otherwise, we are getting a very cheap type of artists in the pictures in our country.
We have taken to something that requires no art, some sort of a- we can call- an acrobatic show that we have on the stage by which we think that we are great [??] who act. All this kind of nonsense has come and is still coming in our main cities, also in our films, and this nonsense has to be outwitted by real art. And I’m very happy that we have this [??] here which will definitely invite this scholarship [??] a real sense of expression of their manifestation of joy, of happiness, unhappiness, and all the things that they have been facing.

It’s a kind of emotion, it is a thing, that, I would say, suggests a work is [inaudible] rightly,
Rama, first of all, who was such a mighty person. But he went in the forest to save Sitaji. If you call it an epic or drama whatever it is, his way expresses a person who believes in truth, believes in honesty, believes in the respect of the women, who fights, such a man – because he knew he would be lost because he’s so mighty he can destroy them, but he fights and in that fight, he gets very badly injured.

For example, that injury was there till Shri Rama came and he gives him the moksha to show that all his sufferings were finished once he got the moksha.
In this world, you won’t have to work, don't have to get injured, don’t have to fight. But in a way, there is a big fight within yourselves. And that fight is that when we try to see ourselves as something very great, very egoistical, and then we start fighting with our ego, what will help you is the feeling of righteousness. This righteousness gets injured many times no doubt.
Now Sahaja Yoga has come to show that you don’t have to fight, you have just to ask for your Realization. It is the time that has brought this for you.

I know I should have [inaudible] anybody could have done who [inaudible].
So it has happened and so you have already got the moksha, so many Sahaja Yogis have achieved it and enjoy the drama much more than any thing else. Because they will realize that they have that, they have struggled with themselves for their seeking. And ultimately they got their Realization. And this will definitely give you a greater hope that we can spread Sahaja Yoga all over.

Art is a part and parcel of a human being, it’s the potential of a human being. We have to develop art because Sahaja Yoga is nothing but to be enjoyed in the realm of God. And if you do not have art, what will you enjoy? But it has to be pure art. Purity is important and as you will see today, art in India has such purity and respect for [inaudible] even it will heal.

I hope in the country where you get born for the Spirit and that culture can be evolved. It has come here all the way from Kolkata and you can become very good [inaudible] of true artists of true types.
I’m sure you’ll enjoy. I’m thankful to both of them for organizing this beautiful drama for all of you to see and enjoy. As the mantra for tonight is that you all enjoy, that’s what it is.
May God bless you all
