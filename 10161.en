Talk to the English Sahaja Yogis, Day prior to Weddings, Bordi (India), Tuesday, February 14th, 1984

Shri Mataji - (Shuffling around, mother is talking to a yogini, settling in the room, discussing arrangements/unclear) Unless and until you are agriculturalists, technically we are not agriculturalists, so he asked the question to say how many agriculturalists are there. So we worked it out, we just put some of the names and we’ll do very fine, put some other names also … (Laughter)..

I said alright we have so many agriculturalists, I don’t have the names, just put some names here and there, it’s alright. No but then we got him the thing and all that, worked it out very hard and now he said we’ll give you 60 more, 60 more acres, so we can do very well and the scheme is working out very much now for the agriculturalists now by the way. 
Alan you have done some agriculture haven’t you?
 
Alan - yes mother

Shri Mataji - Now we have, have .. uh Nick here, Nick what did you do in agriculture?

Nick - I did a general degree mother, I was working with cows. Cattle. 

Shri Mataji - Alright, I think you and Alan and Dr (Unclear/Sal?) and Hamid. These four persons must form a collective and I have already given full ideas to Dr. (Sal?) as to what we want to do. How we want to bring this project of agriculture. At first you should know what are our extra modern ideas about agriculture, we have some ideas of ways now we’ll discuss all that and after that we are going to make it. You see it is more for the western life where you have these machines to pick up.. (unclear).. And all that. There’s no need, it’s too rigid, we don’t have all these problems.
So to Indianise, to Indianise this is the second process that you go on then to Indian life, for Indian atmosphere because we have all provided already you don’t have to worry about it and then thirdly put Sahaja Yoga. So the whole thing is outwards. Use Sahaja yoga in this way so the epitome of that is Sahaja Yoga how we work it out. And the fourth thing is you need to keep the data from this.. uh .. what do you call.. Uh interview, from this what do you call it project you can call it. 
You have a complete uh.. Data and also what you call it.. Statistics, mention the statistics. So that when we have interviews with other people, so that we have a data to offer them. This is the thing, this is the way. 
So you four you can.. (unclear).. Who else, who else, has done agriculture?....
Alright. So four are sufficient I think. A project of four things, of carbon, of four valencies… (unclear).
Now those who are going back raise your hands. Now what are your opinions..(unclear).. The end of the first (unclear/week?/trip?) …Alright. End of the (unclear/week?/trip?)...Now let’s have your opinion.

Yogini - Well uh I feel I got exactly what I needed, not exactly what I thought I would get, more what I needed. 

Shri Mataji - So these ideas of what you should get must be discarded, what you get, not what you think you should get, alway. You see this is one thing one should understand.
So this is practical, whatever you are going to get, you are going to get, but if you have preconceived ideas, then what you get are going to become frustrations. So we should not have preconceived ideas, just keep your minds open.
So now what is the second thing, how do you feel? … (Silence)...

Yogi - Well I can tell you something that she herself said to me after a couple of weeks when she was always the last one to be on the bus. And it was something like this, that she herself now feels need to be smart and on time and to be quick.

Shri Mataji - Imagine this being ..(unclear)... the English, who are known for their time keeping,.. (unclear).. The whole year. And such people like the English should say that because you understand there is inertia now setting in as a result of what you did, too much. There’s an inertia and that’s why you find English people have s struggle to cope with the smartness and the quickness of things and this inertia is going really, very fast I feel now. I mean people who go now to England can’t believe that these are the English who came here, used to get up at 5 and used to … (unclear) .. stand here and take in the hand and shout ATTENTION! ..(Laughter)..
And this kind of a thing. Where is their attention lost.
So it’s a good thing that you say you have to get up but not with the idea, you see they did it because they enjoyed their domination and their ego, but this is now only can do it with the help of Ganesha, see? It’s Ganesha’s style, because you have seen the Maharashtrians, what they have got done, how light they are .. (unclear).. Finish off everything, so fast. There’s a word in Marathi ..( Marthi phrase).. Means, means to finish off fast, you get ready fast, this one word can mean everything but means fast movement of your preparation which you just get ready, the achievement is getting ready, when you get ready you see some of the people get ready alright but then… (unclear).. There is a tail and the tail is bigger than the animal sort of thing and it trails behind and all this way and this is the mantra we must understand that in England there’s a big inertia and the worst part of it is that it is the heart and the one who has the heart with inertia gets Angina. With (Unclear/addition?) to the left Vishuddhi you and get a body which is Angina. 
So heart is so important. I mean imagine you get Angina on this body… (unclear)
So the English have a special, a very special uh.. Thing to be done, that they have to be smart. And this is one of the things where you don’t have to waste time thinking about other things and bothering about other things and analysing other things and sitting in the bathroom for hours together, so it is nice the bathrooms are not too much good. So we get used to quick bathing, quick everything and that quickness and if you get time in between and you start thinking you just go into a .. (unclear) so the best thing is to get equipped uh with.. (unclear)... 
English language has lots of good things because they did it before so this is what should happen to the young people getting up, and I’m sure that kind of thing, you’ll have no time to think, no time for drugs, see if somebody says why don’t you take drug you’ll say I have no time to take drug .. (Laughter).
Now I don’t take drinks, I have no time, I am a busy person. Like my grandchildren you see they are all the time somebody come, to our house to meet them and they are too busy cleaning the house, doing this, fixing them, putting on, so they just don’t want to talk to them, so we are just now busy. See they are busy people, my grandchildren are busy, say you better continue with your walks. See they are working that side to clear out so we have no time so … (unclear)... what ever you must see to work out.. (unclear)..
Because lethargy is a disease and then you’ll go to the left side and it’s very dangerous to be, just come out of it some how, with Sahaja Yoga, try to be more on the smartness living. Lethargy, taking drugs, sitting down, that is not the way. The first thing is this movement in the villages is going to give you an idea that comfort doesn’t give you the quality of life, you see now in England unless and until you have holidays the quality of life is not good. Unless and until you run out of your house the quality is not good. 
For example, me and my husband both have a very comfortable house you know that, but neither my husband nor me, we never have comforts and we have a house just there, how many times must have slept on my bed I don’t know because we both are busy people, no time for comforts, so we have to be busy and we have… (noisy) .. over come these comfort. Actually in England especially, I have seen we have very few bathrooms, like in Linda’s house I have seen ..(Laughter).. But in India they would like attached bathrooms when actually can just go and bath in the river, and in the morning if you get up you can go to the beach. Can get your bath there. Can do everything and you can be very fresh, really I think we should try take to the river there open under the sky and you can have a bath there nicely and comfortably no problem, not a tub but a big whole tub like that in which you can swim, do what you like… and the river flowing beautiful clean water. Alright, so under this understanding if you know, then half of the problems and I’m happy the group that came from England have behaved so well because Americans ran away… (unclear).. But English have quite a lot of ..(unclear).. Resistive power and sense in their behaviour and we have given them.. (unclear).. Are basically very wise people because English have to be because you are the heart, but this lethargy, you know are lethargic, you know that, but you must take out, for that you you can raise your right side and Saraswati’s (Unclear mantra?/Power?) is there and you can work it out because the spirit is so in England and this lethargy settling in and all of the vices that are taking you away from this thing so you have to work it out and I’m sure..(unclear),, and what ever (Surya?) is there, whatever energy is there becomes the ether, that’s the point so if you could remove that part of the ego you see it covers the heart and you become like a stone. You see you have no even energy to feel anything, nothing, you can’t feel anything…(noise).. So on the whole.. (unclear).. So on the whole.. The food attitude must change also, to not have worry about the food, see this time I think I must have starved at least half of the time. I starve myself in the dinner time, I will not take my meal in England. It needs this, so you need not fast in the name of God but sometimes you must fast yourself and you must have simple food because you know your lives are (horrible?) this is very bad combination see the lethargy and the liver you see. It’s such mutual understanding that so it goes on from that… (unclear)... 
So you have limited energy as far as Sahaja Yoga is concerned because of the ego, so first of all remove the ego part, say “not the thing, not the thing, not the thing”, don’t even think about it, don’t think, don’t think, don’t don’t don’t and it will work out alright….(unclear)..

Yogini - (talking quietly)...

Shri Mataji - That’s it you have to seek peace and peace comes by not accepting the norms of nonsensical things like how you are going to .. (unclear)... It doesn’t come, it comes from how you are going to enjoy yourself from within, see how you are within, see how is your spirit. And the whole atmosphere once you establish yourself it will be very peaceful. People are smart, they are not lethargic and the atmosphere is peaceful, very peaceful and those, busy with this, buy with that, so many attachments, they cannot rise high. So it’s very important she said that you have to be peaceful and then the joy. Unless and until you have peace, you cannot feel the joy. And the third thing is the collective. Actually the collectiveness when you have .. (unclear).. But three of them put together is simple like that, you must love your mother. If you doubt your mother it cannot work out, it works out better, much better, if you will be collective, if you love your mother you will be collective. If you love your mother you will all talk about me. See English people know everything about England. Darlington, you ask them, what is Darlington? Mother, is the favourite glassware. You ask them, where can you get this, they know each and everything, they know all about it. And they know what is to be done and how it works, it’s very interesting the way they know about it ..uhh because they love it, English love it. See England is their love and that’s why they love.
If you don’t know about your mother, talk to each other, what you know about her? What you know about her? That will tell you, that will give you the joy and the peace because if you know about your mother then you will know there’s nothing to worry, there’s nothing to be upset, there’s nothing to hold onto, just to be peaceful. Because when you are in the lap of you mother, you just enjoy. The child you see, the child is in the seventh heaven when he’s with the mother. In the same way, you will feel peaceful .. (unclear).. 

Yogi - I’ve learned a lot mother, I’ve learned a lot, many things that I’d like to go back to England and tell.

Shri Mataji - What I’m saying that you’ve learned something from the Indians also.

Yogi - yes many things, many things.

Shri mataji - they are very wise. See they are not stupid people, they are very wise people and they can’t understand people can enjoy these stupid things. Once they are told this is not to be done they are finished. You see for them to listen to their mother is the greatest wisdom. Like Ganesha. See they know Ganesha, so you can say this is all nonsensical, finished. They’ll not look at it again. I don’t have to go around “now don’t do it again, don’t do it, don’t do it”, once Mother has said don’t do it, so they are obedient, innate obedience, because traditionally they have been brought up they know what is the.. (unclear).. They know she, she is the Mother, she is the Primordial, to them .. (unclear).. We go to the villages, they have never seen me before, see how anxious they are to touch my feet. They don’t want to listen to my lectures! Accept it, what you say is correct .. (Laughter). 
They are so anxious to touch my feet. Not only them but even the big politicians, chief minister, anybody. What he’s anxious is to touch my feet, Surrender. That is what we find in England is lacking, is out of the question for anybody to come here and touch my feet. 

Yogi - too much ego, Mother.

Shri Mataji - Ego means ignorance about it. We have no traditions of political life, economical life, but of social life, spiritual life.. (unclear)..  That a saint is a saint, whether Hindu, Muslim, Christian, a saint is a saint and he is to be respected and a saint is to be worshipped. Now this fellow came in I said come along now behave yourself.. (unclear).. Is a saint.. (unclear).. Some officers came to stay here and they heard about my.. (unclear).. And they said “oh no, not if Mataji’s staying here, we’ll have nothing to do with it” … (Laughter)
So this is my point, Warren has seen the other people who stayed here have seen how quick they were to organise my program.

Yogi - they are very efficient, the Indians are very efficient.

Shri Mataji - Smooth, really smooth, because they never try to show off, to them it is a service to themselves that they can do something.

Yogi - They enjoy serving you, one of them asked me if I would like anything while I was having my meal and I said no and he said, don’t be so formal and that he wanted to bring me something, so asked him to bring me a glass of water and he was very happy just to bring me a glass of water.

Shri Mataji - No but that is it, they have servitude, but the English people, they can not, they have ego, they can never serve anybody. On top they have a balloon that won’t drop down, so they can never serve anyone. But these people, to serve another person, to serve another saint, you will never find him fighting, never any harshness, being harsh to him, very gentle, very smoothly they work it out. But I’ve seen the people from the west. Now, now is much better. When we came, used to shout at them, “this is not good, that is not good”. As if you are great.. (unclear).. Very common you start seeing this, and it’s not servitude, very ego-istical, just gross as if you have no manners. It’s a very horrible thing, do this way, do that way, after all what have you done? Why should you demand? You are not the ruler, now see you move, alright. That’s done, now what else. 

Sahaja Yogi - It was very nice to meet so many friendly people. 

Shri Mataji - They are happy to meet you, they told that (Yogi Name) has worked very hard, he did everything, will climb up these things, that .. (Laughter) .. and is a most hard working man and all. That they told me great things about you and that I am to give him something special and I don’t know what to give him special because in England you get everything that you can even think of but whatever you suggest I’ll give. Now what else, who else?

Yogini - much of it has already been said but I feel as though it’s given myself greater strength to go home and I haven’t been home since I got my realisation here .. (unclear).. In Australia so I can go home. 

Shri Mataji - Self confidence

Yogini - much more

Shri Mataji - good

Yogini - Also the same, confidence to go back to England with, but something else about the Indians, I don’t think once on the trip we ever saw them get flustered, they never get flustered. They’re always so calm, whatever’s happening, they’re always calm.

Shri Mataji - Because they don’t condemn themselves and they don’t condemn the whole world. If you just start working on yourself you start to condemn yourself, I am this, I am that, so you see they don’t condemn anybody and they don’t aggress anybody. They are so peaceful and they are working you see, they are doing every work without any difficulties, nothing. One shout at one person and the whole things gets settled down, so you see no problem. Even people who are not realised souls are so good to you and so nice, I mean the whole thing is different, it is not because you are English, but you are saints my children, so they think it’s right that you have come all the way you are .. (unclear).. Means honoured guests! 
Honoured guests you are. As guests they have to serve you and to serve the guests is something .. (unclear).. And the way they do it, money matters and everything, they are so smooth and no problem. I give account and I never check, I say spend as you like. Even if you want 40 or 50 I’ll give you. But he felt ashamed he said, no no no. So this is what it is to them to achieve spirituality, the highest, not money, not power. So that’s how they want to help because they think by that way they will achieve. Is a good idea, I’m happy and we should imbibe these ideas. But also they are not perfect people. They are not perfect, they lack how to fix their machines, the facilities .. (Laughter) always the pay phones are out of order, WC’s are out of order, anything you want is out of order, everything in India is out of order .. (unclear).. 
But they have their spirituality. This one is slightly alright.. (unclear)..  But they have no sense of aluminium or cement. And when I told them they want to have huts made out of Indian mud they all looked so shocked. They said Mother how can that be. They want to having cement and they are insisting, no no Mother we can get cheap cement.. (unclear)..  I had to tell them openly that we don’t want cement, we want just mud houses, but they can’t understand it. See that’s why they are quite stupid, they don’t understand value, aesthetic value of things, uh like if you see their paintings and things like that the frames they select.. (unclear).. This frame should be straight.. (unclear)..  Now whatever is lying there is lying there, what is lingering is lingering and person who has habit of collecting is collecting there, but we have to work out so let us all imbibe their qualities inside and then outside, because you know outside you have received quite a lot... (unclear)..  Bhoots now .. (unclear).. (Laughter) .. (unclear)..  Have experimented with all our exterior things and we have .. (unclear).. Too far, and they have now, whatever it is, have tried to copy you but they don’t understand the evils of what you have reached .. (unclear).. It’s an evil .. (unclear)..  Matter must be seen as matter. Now imagine a cement house standing in a village somewhere, how will it look? But to them cement is God. That is what it is.. (unclear)..  All their agnyas are being .. (unclear - obscured?) … by what is going on .. (unclear).. Country. And they are getting on this plastic, plastic is very important, all this is very important. 
Doesn’t matter, so that should .. (unclear)..  forget.. (unclear).. They have not work out with their mind, they are too simple, to them plastic is a very special thing.. (unclear)..  Nonsensical, you jeans you can pay here ten times the price of Kashmir, they have taken all your things from America to Delhi, i.e. .. (unclear)..  And all that (Laughter).
That’s a fact you won’t understand how these people have gone so far .. (unclear).. Aluminium.

Yogi - Nylon Saris 

(Laughter)

Shri Mataji - .. (unclear)..  You must understand this is the stupidity they have, they don;t understand our colour schemes are wrong, aesthetically and all that. So to give them ideas about the aesthetics of the matter you have to tell them what is that (motor noises).
Then if you are going for a big function say for a Puja then you must wear a suit.. (unclear).. Tie and all that.. (unclear).. Well dressed man. They don’t know that those that are extra-modern they are different. So it’s a very good idea that you respect their traditions and respect their .. (unclear).. I don’t ask that you wear this in England, but here respect, in England you wear what you like of course.. (unclear)..  The women should not wear five colours on the body, sixth colour on the head .. (Laughter) 
But it’s very common in London. I must say I went to Rome, Rome they had around the river they had .. (unclear).. Of different colours.. (unclear).. So we all went to see. They were all singing some horrible song and what they were selling and wearing was the multicolour stuff how do you call it?

Yogi - (Brand name/clothing name)

Shri Mataji - (Brand Name/Clothing name) they were selling. I said is there any sensible thing they are producing .. (unclear)..  Oh but we created (brand name/clothing name) Is it true it came out of English thing. 

Yogi - It came from France, Mother. 

Yogini - We say it comes from France, but they say it probably comes from England. 

Yogi - It was just after the flower people .. (unclear).. I think it originates from France. 

Shri Mataji - and prospered there.. (unclear).. 

Yogi - It was no the only thing.

Shri Mataji - That is another thing about the English, they think no end of French. They are the stupidest people ever, I mean you have all learned something. They have to learn something. So don’t go near them ever (Laughter).
They [English] don’t understand they are the Heart. They learn from Americans and learn from these French people. They are so stupid, even our telephone systems are done by the French, they have made it very delicate and never works. French, now they are breaking their heads, why did you give it to the French,  they make everything delicate, even the pier. See they made a pier in (Kohlapur?) the French. And they made it so delicate that it’s all finished. Everywhere the French have gone, they are alright for women and wine, but otherwise….
So this is what they try to do, better know they make everything delicate, if you want something delicate, it’s alright. So this is what it is.
I mean the language is very harsh.. (unclear).. Bathrooms alright.. (unclear).. So I would not say you take traditions from the French, on the contrary, those French they came here are a headache, very difficult to manage them. So best is to stick to English language is quite nice, much friendlier than French and not to learn all these bad things from the French, so that is what it is.

.. (unclear).. 

So we are doing to have the education of 21 crafts, Indian crafts, see these bangles how you make, silver snake and all that. So for that we are thinking of starting a school here of your age and I think when they come here they might see this life and they might see how the Indians there are and might be that might work out better. 
That’s it, moreover it’s very expensive in England to learn that if you come here it can be done very cheap.
See that hut there see now it is a .. (unclear).. It’s going to be a.. (unclear).. 
(Joking and Laughter)
That the thing full of horrible stuff, we take it out, full of bugs, lizards, parasites.. (Laughter)
But we’ll make it very comfortable inside. 

Yogi - Maybe buy that piece of land we’ve been looking at in .. (unclear name of location)..  Bay.

Shri Mataji - But this is a fishing village, this is the kind of a thing.. (unclear).. .. (unclear).. .. (Talking over design plans)

Now you have all talked all of you have been here.

Yogini -  (Starts talking about Indians hosts again) .. (unclear).. .. (unclear).. 

Shri Mataji -  Very innocent people, like a child, they are very collective. .. (unclear).. Alright who else?

Yogini - Simplicity, so simple .. (unclear).. They have the desire to be one with your spirit.

Shri Mataji -  That’s it, that’s it. By thinking we have really put people in imbalance, too much thinking, too much thinking, inside outside, imbalance... (unclear).. .. (unclear)..  (talking about attention) and goes to the people who haven’t get and works out, like the villagers are the poorest and if you show them something they will take to it and it will work out even (word in Hindi?) people, have tremendous respect for me, wherever I go they know I’m there.. (unclear)..  Because the basic thing is they understand is that it’s the spirituality, so they are very normal people, very normal.. (unclear).. Well .. (unclear).. 

Yogi - I’ve learned not to use my mind, because every time I’ve made my mind about something an event will happen that will turn it around (Laughter).
Shri Mataji - That’s one of the qualities of the Mother, that sankalpa (virkalpa para?), anything you try to build up will be toppled down.

Yogi - and then the collective works.

Shri Mataji - The collective?

Yogi - The collective works out everything, things have progressed so well in England because this (party?) has been such a good one. It’s only coming here that I’ve seen why things are working so well. 

Shri Mataji -  ya it will work in India and it will manifest there.

Yogi - It works out if you are (peaceful?) then everyone is benefitting.

Shri Mataji - It channelises. We should be good channels, if there are obstructions in the channels, how am I to channelise. Things are working out so well now for England and I’m sure you are the foundation of Sahaja Yoga. There you have to work it out. Of course you should be cleansed, you should be corrected, because the body has to be alright agreed, but you must also cooperate, you must also work it out, you work out on personal level and I must find out now for (name of Yogini) see (yogini) I want to marry and I thought she will divert some attention to her marriage, pick it up and work it but actually her attitude is still English and she cannot change it, she tries to correct that man, she doesn’t want to correct herself, even now as she is. I wouldn’t say she is anywhere near good you see, but she will try to correct him instead of try to correct [herself] all attention is on others, this is the English attitude, but the attitude should be that we should correct ourselves, instead of correcting others, it can never help!

Yogini - Mataji, there’s a good thing that says “when I am well, everybody else is well”.

Shri Mataji - That’s it, that is the thing to do is to see that you are well and you should not try to correct other, after all that’s what you are doing.

Yogini - .. (unclear).. Mother, since she’s been here she has never felt so much joy.

Shri Mataji - Mmm, the heart has come, alright

Yogini - It’s really true, Mother. Last week we all had so many stories, so many miracles, 10 a day, and so many seekers, everywhere, seekers and seekers and talking about you.

Shri Mataji - It’s channelising very fast, but also I’ve done something else which you don’t know about!
(lots of laughter)
Alright, so for the newcomers, I’ve told them what is to be expected now, what about your shirts and things, what have you done?

Yogi - Kurtha Pajamas are fixed for the men and we have yet to get (clothing name) provided (Indian Yogi name) says they might be able to get a (clothing name) man to come but it hasn’t happened so it will have to be in by (name) or (name) but they don’t have anything for their.. (unclear).. .. (unclear).. 

Shri Mataji - we will have a look

Yogi - And the second thing is we’ve just made an announcement that the ladies should buy only what they need not … (tape cuts out for a while).. 

Shri Mataji - I’m sorry they will need at least three Saris, three is the minimum number of Saris you should have. 

Yogi - He did say need meaning they may already have some.

Shri Mataji - You have some but if you have very old ones they may be torn. 

Yogini - My experience of living in India is that you need at least three Saris or five, more than three. 

Shri Mataji - It is true that is what it is.

Yogi - They should all buy three from here?

Shri Mataji - You see one thing is that I’ve seen when you come to India, should not come thinking of saving money, because when you told me, mm, Mother we had to buy .. (unclear).. They said they want Saris for 15 people .. (unclear)..  I gave it a bandhan, how much you pay for each Sari.

Yogi - 100 each.

Shri Mataji - And everything, that’s very good.

Yogi - So I don’t think there should be any objection of then buying three like that automatically they should buy three.

Shri Mataji - This is all of course on the Indians .. (unclear)..  You have given them measurements and three Saris I think you all should have. 

Yogi - Can you tell all the girls please. 

Shri Mataji - How many ladies are there?

Yogini - six ladies on the second tour 

Yogi - six extra.
Shri Mataji - Saris for 40 

Yogi - Something remarkable, these beautiful Saris. 

Shri Mataji - and the stitching must have cost you more than that.

Yogi - about 15 and the peticoat, it was a bargain. 

Shri Mataji - So that one needs to collect.

Yogi -  It’s been done, (name) is doing it.

Shri Mataji - Actually give it to me, she already has enough headaches.. (unclear)..  So how many are getting married?

.. (unclear).. .. (unclear).. 

Yogi - I don’t know what’s happened but since coming to India, there have been several occasions where I felt something I never felt in England, just of knowing I’m a realised soul and that everything else that happens is extra.

Shri Mataji - You are very confident about that is that. And that’s the point and secondly that is the blessful way, it blesses things, in this country you are a saint. The vibrations are such that nowhere else in the world have I found, if a saint comes to this country they get respect. .. (unclear)..  It’s a very blissful country .. (unclear).. Because I have told them don’t complain about your poverty, if you get your Yoga .. (unclear).. 
(Joking and Laughing)
Now what you have to do is don’t get impressed by the intellectuals of India, lectures, so they try and impress you very much, now don’t get involved, be careful that those that try to intellectualise and talk big and I’ll give you some higher, this .. (unclear).. So talk too much you should not begin with because intellectuals can be befooled by these intellectuals, alright. So now what about you?

Yogi - I think, uh.. I know now that the west is under this conception that you can judge yourself by the height of your financial index and that really the true wealth is that when a country looks at the sweetness of their children. Then you know that the country is rich and that is the true wealth and if the children ask things. 

Shri Mataji - They are very quiet. You know in England if the children are about you have to send them out, but here the child sits, you see the other day for hours together they are sitting. But an English child, or any western child cannot sit for five minutes, the child all the time is running and making noises and shouting and screaming, have you noticed it, especially when we are in a program in the town hall. All the persons of the town hall say why you have children from outside they don't listen to you running, shouting and screaming, running down, they cannot sit down, so surprising. And the mothers also are very agitated no doubt but especially the children I am surprised. 
It’s difficult to make them sit and be quiet, that’s the big problem for us, but I hope it will develop, they just can’t sit. Anybody, even realised souls are like that, they cannot sit in meditative position it’s too hard. 

Yogini - The nativity play was a wonderful example of how teachable these little three year olds are. Half of them were sitting down watching you and the other half were really acting. More or less doing what they were told. I mean English children they are either running off or they all get egos. 

Shri Mataji - Very difficult, very difficult but they will calm down. I’m sure they will calm down. This is the trouble is that there are all these bhoots around, you allow these bhoots to use your ego, you become, you become .. (unclear)..  Horrible. You are no more, like a bhoot you become, like a monster you start working for them, the whole thing is anti-god, it works out like that. If the ego starts working out the bhoots fly, all the time you see you are taken over. They are called as (Vishatkas??) Is the worst thing to become. So it is a serious thing, I’m sure all your negativity will drop out, all your spirits will drop out, and when you go back I’m sure you can do something great there because you are filled with vibrations and you’ll have to give this to others and try to improve the conditions there.
Now those of you who are left-sided have to be very careful than the right-sided because they can see their ego better but the left-sided people think you see all these ideas and this and that, sitting down they think they are meditating, but they are not meditating they give into the left and finishing off. 
Steady your eyes, to steady your eyes put them on the Mother Earth, and put rose water and the (nectar?) and that in the eyes and also light all the time, those who are left-sided should use as much as possible the lights and things like that. I know you all have got these things in the house and if need be you can get them from India .. (unclear).. 
Not so much the electrical light but the natural light. So candle is nice you can get them all very cheaply in England and put your eyes onto the photograph through that light. I’m sure it will get better, also the backside, even the Kundalini should be raised with light. Try to use the light of the lamp [oil lamp]. How many of you have? But you can buy, very easy to get. You can get it very easy but now they are going away, so those who don’t have if you can leave a list, the people from Bombay, they will get you it. I mean can get it in the market also, they are easy to find. 

Yogi - It’s much more effective than wax candle I’ve noticed. It’s not auspicious to use wax.. (unclear)..  Made of quite rubbish by-products actually.

Yogini - is it alright to use mustard oil or sunflower oil?

Shri Mataji - It’s alright, best is to use ghee, of course in India ghee is very cheap, but is very good for the eyes you see, soothes your eyes.. (unclear)..  So many people don’t have this system, see why you develop type 1 diabetes and bad eyes the reason is the fats are not consumed properly and they do not supply the cells of the optic lobe here and that’s why. 
As you know .. (unclear).. Different fats.. (unclear).. And the brain is made of fat cells and the fat that is for the brain is not supplied sufficiently. If that fat cell could be used for the eyes then there’s no problem .. (noises) .. good for the eyes .. (unclear).. .

Yogi - Anthony and (Dell?) are the ones who came to Australia and they have degenerative macular disease [age related condition resulting in blurred vision and vision loss] degeneration of the cells themselves, it’s improved slightly since realisation. 

Shri Mataji - They should use only ghee.

Yogi - Yes that’s what I was just saying..

Shri Mataji - Also little bit of .. (unclear).. .. (unclear).. Even the ghee applied to the Vishuddhi is a very good idea . I mean you come from the land of conditionings of .. (unclear).. 

Yogi - They come from Jersey originally mother. 

Shri Mataji - That is what I’m saying! 

(Laughter)

Shri Mataji - Is full of it .. (unclear)..  All the Jersey people dying of cancer and .. (unclear).. Are bad because of that. The custom in England is to bury every body. In India only the saints are buried. Otherwise the non- those who are not saints are just burnt off, it’s easy. So we have this everywhere. In England you go anywhere, full of graves, in the churches also. 

Yogi - Sally from Australia’s parents have a tomato farm growing on an old graveyard and they supply to Covent Garden in London. 

(gasps, laughter)

Shri Mataji - my fruit, I vibrate it, I go round the whole place [Covent Garden] I have worked very hard ..(motor noises)...
England I have worked very hard, India I have not worked so hard. Maybe next time I will come and show these people how much I have worked for them and show these people they have to hurry up now and know how much I have worked for them they have .. (unclear).. .. (unclear).. (Hindi?) and all the efforts I have put in because England is very important to the heart, the heart should not fail. It’s very important you have to sustain it, you have to humble down, you will always say you have to humble down in your heart, if the heart is not humble then .. (unclear).. And that is just opposite, all the ego you have generated from there. You have to understand you have a very great responsibility  .. (motor noise) .. 
All this time I have spent, and it’s most important and we should take it very seriously and we have to work it out. 
Unless and until you have the heart, for the heart I have worked so hard, I have done anything, ran up and down, I have done everything that’s possible and I don’t know next year how much time I can give you people again so far now I’m not helping any so much as I am here, so now it is important that we the English have to realise that the spiritual ascent of the whole Universe depends on us (train noises)..... You have to change ourselves, transform ourselves change our ideas, no more complaints, no more nonsense, try to believe yourself as the pioneers of the spirit. Take responsibility. Alright …. (some silence)..............

Yogi - We will have to do something about money, Mother.

Yogi- about 700 for Delhi and 300 for Bombay. As You said about 15 days, so it’s split 11 and 4 like that.

Shri Mataji -Alright, what else?.. (unclear).. For Ashram.. (unclear).. They need .. (unclear).. That is the first Indian ashram they have started so we have to .. (unclear)..  Alright anything else?
