GURU PUJA, July 1977

Today is the day of worshipping your Guru; that is your Mother.  And as I told you, it’s a very unique happening that Mother Herself has to become your Guru, and also you know that it is a very difficult task for a Mother to be a Guru... because Her love is so overflowing that it is difficult for Her to give any discipline to Her children.  She cannot discipline Her own Love, how can She discipline Her children?  Being that, the responsibility on the disciples is much more.
If the Guru is the person who can discipline you without feeling anything hurting to him, he is much more capable and he can do it.  But for a Mother, which is a very, very very difficult... How do you say? Very difficult job [to be a Guru?]. She does not know how to [balance?], and She is extremely [concerned?] because She is the Mother.  While the Guru from the very beginning does not [concern?].  But Mother, till the end She’ll go to the last [depths/strength?]  Even if the child has [UNCLEAR] even if he has beaten [Her up?], even if he is willing to kill Her, She will be saying that, “My child are you hurt?”
Then the responsibility of the disciple is much more [?] that they do not hurt Her.  And they do not take My Love for granted, for they must know that they have to prove themselves. And they have to improve their [UNCLEAR].
That is why this day it is a very unique combination of tremendous love overflowing you, and also the [thought?]  or you can say, the Divine inspiration that tells you that you have to be responsible.  You have to be disciplined Sahaj.  Not by [UNCLEAR], but has to be.  Because if the ship is not properly tied up, it is not still working, it cannot go very far.  If you want to enjoy the ride in the ocean of His grace and compassion, His bliss and [sun?], then you must build up yourself fully.
Now we have seen, we have [UNCLEAR] And we get [UNCLEAR] and we can awaken them by awakening [the spirit?] But it is not a mechanical process. Every deity has got a subtle point behind Him which is a very subtle being within you. You know them one by one, and you know why these chakras are catching because you lack that. There is nothing to feel bad about it.  As I told you, it is like your motor car outside. This is an instrument but the instrument has to be properly organised [and cleaned?].  Today I want certain promises by you to be reached.  And the foremost of all: as Christ has said, “Love thy neighbour as thyself”.  I would say, one step ahead of that: “Love thy neighbour, a Sahaja yogi, more than yourself”.  Let us start.  I don’t ask you to do for the whole [world, amass?].
First of all decide what have you done for [Her]?  Second promise you have to make, that will never say a harsh word to any other [Sahaja yogi/person?], even if he beats you [up?].  You can tell [Me then?].  That is the greatest sin you [UNCLEAR].  Don't try to correct others. If he asks you to check things then tell that [UNCLEAR].   But do not be harsh; use your tongue for saying something sweet.  I am telling you again and again and again.  Otherwise I will put some sort of a restriction on you.  Try to control your tongue.  Very essential to put sweetness - you have to.  You are Sahaja Yogis.  Very easy to put in sweetness.  It is [UNCLEAR] attractive.  Why do you say harsh things? For what? To create enemy?  You want to have enemies? You can have [UNCLEAR]. For that you need not [have Sahaj?]  Very easy to gather enemies, and difficult to get [UNCLEAR]. 
As Sahaja Yogis, You have one Mother, and that hurts Me the most.  Any...anything that tries to break through [UNCLEAR] take out My heart [UNCLEAR] very fast.  And this body, it can become divided into many parts. So don't do that to Me. This is the greatest suffering I can have from you.  I request you not to do that because I have taken you into My Being, and you are part and parcel of Me. You are one of the thousand petals of My Sahasrara, and I don’t want [UNCLEAR] to be broken by you and to be trampled by [it?].
You have your own dignity and respect the dignity [of others] And you are sahaja yogis – realised. Must know, you are not ordinary people.  As you respect yourself, you respect others. This is one thing I have to tell you: that among yourselves you should be very humble and very [UNCLEAR] and extremely [kind?] Also when you start going there gradually you will learn a method by which you will be very [Sahaj?].  It is better to be sweet than to be harsh.  It is better to be beaten up than to be beating others. It is better to be [UNCLEAR] and deceived than to be deceiving others. 
We are like the shield and the shield has to fight the sword; sword doesn’t fight the sword, the shield does. This is, you must understand, that for anything no harsh word needs to be said - keep quiet.  Just try to control your [tongue?]  That is one thing - that there should be no disunity because you are collectively conscious among yourselves. If there is disunity among you, you cannot be one and how can we think of the whole world? Just think of it.  And your responsibility is much greater because you are the first people who have got it in the whole of Europe and the whole of England.
Respect each other. Think of the good points that everyone has.  Try to love.  If I were like, “You know I am complete, I have no problem.  Why am I bothering?”  Because I love you.  If you love each other, you will see the good points of another and you will imbibe.  Try to love each other, but do not confuse this love with the carnal love.  It is Divine love.  Absolutely pure, elevating, helping you to ascend. Tonight, you promise Me that you will look at every Sahaja yogi as a person in bondage in love and not in hatred.  And if somebody you think is not doing right or doing bad, then you cure that person sitting in the house.  You know how to [do it?].
But don’t be harsh.  By talking, you are not going to do anything to him.  You use your methods which you know very well.  This is one point and that will give you the greatest gift, the greatest of all: when I will see all My children loving each other, being kind to each other, running to do for others, trying to help each other, and extremely humbled down.  Some of you are better off, some of you are more intelligent. Some of you have got more heart qualities.  Don’t try to show down somebody who lacks little bit in intelligence, or somebody who has little less of love - maybe that person just wants more love.  But try to give that [respect to others?].
Then, the second one: I want to, all of you, today to know that you are the people who have to build up Sahaja Yoga in this country, and also in other countries wherever you go.  So water it like seeds, and the seed which has to grow the whole thing. You have to bear all other trees -  so how important.
So today you have to resolve, that in your personal life you are going to be [UNCLEAR].  You are going to [watch?] yourself, you are going to introspect yourself, you are not going to tell lies and you are going to look after your chastity: look after your life as a very precious [thing?].  And you are not going to cheat yourself, and you are not going to deviate yourself, and you are not going to delegate yourself in your own eyes, but develop those eyes which criticise all these things and can see yourself.  Today you must promise Me that you will meditate, to introspect, then get into your [UNCLEAR].
Thirdly, you will not criticise Sahaja Yoga - that is [God’s movement?]- at any cost!  If you do not understand a part of Sahaja Yoga, you can come and ask Me, but don't criticise.  This is you must promise.  So far whatever has been happened, has happened; it is finished, it is [forgiven?], but don't criticise the way now anymore, because now you are put into a higher...you are put into a higher position today. No more criticism of Sahaja Yoga, at any cost, I think!  Because then you beat yourself hard. If you don't understand [UNCLEAR].  And now you know, you are the [gurus?] - God will send only those who really know that Sahaja Yoga is the... is the only way. Because believe Me, only very few people knew. And this is going to save the whole humanity and all the people. And God can be only understood through Sahaja Yoga.  Nobody is going to [decry?] Sahaja Yoga.  Nor anybody is going to say that, "I am the Sahaja Yoga".  Anybody who can say that has been, always so far we have seen in our practices in Sahaja Yoga for the last so many years.  That anyone who takes upon to himself that, "I am the Sahaja Yoga" has had the worst possible [UNCLEAR]. So don't do it. You are a part and parcel of that thing harmonising people [UNCLEAR]. So nobody should criticise Sahaja Yoga.  Nobody should take chances with Sahaja Yoga.
 And fourth: you have to be obedient to Me.  I have been... Can you do it?  [You are a different way?], in every way, that you should understand. Now, the point; today you have done this puja, I want to tell you that on your own, on your free will, with your own understanding, you have to be obedient to Me.  This is your own decision. I cannot force obedience on you.  But you must understand it is for you. Because every minute I can see your future, I can see your past, I can see your ascent; I can see everything.  If I say anything at that moment [UNCLEAR].  I am not asking too much; you have seen now much as other gurus [UNCLEAR]. You do not know other gurus what do they do?  They will hang the disciple in the well half way down.  He is just there, from his waist, you see, they will be hanging the rope up.  They take seven parikshas like this horrible ones. They will throw him into some place, seven like this, there are all together 108 parikshas.  And then they'll say, "Come along."  Then they will try, it [UNCLEAR].   I am not taking your test, but obedience is very necessary because I know everything; I can't help it. You cannot have another opinion about My [UNCLEAR] because that is [UNCLEAR].   And if I say something I would not say normally, I will not hurt you no doubt - I hate to hurt you.  After any hurt I cause you, I weep and cry.  But I have to because you are My dearest children, and you are My [will?] and you have to do the most important thing [UNCLEAR] to do for you.  
Whatever I have told you, for today, for this day as today's function [UNCLEAR]. These are the three [of My wishes?] I haven’t asked for much, but it was [UNCLEAR] very difficult.  So look after yourself; try to be good Sahaja Yogis.  Be sweet to each other, be kind to each other, don't befool yourself,  look after your vibrations and everything will [work out?].
