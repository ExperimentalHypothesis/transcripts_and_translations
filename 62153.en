Interview Before Public Program, Milan, Italy 1989-08-05

Interviewer: I mean, there is a chance about all the books.

Shri Mataji: No, no, no, You see, there is only one book which is Patanjali, and he has called it the Ashtanga Yoga long time back, [unclear]. With great, great aspects of yoga. Like he stars, with the possibility of getting up the centres, tensing up the centers, and then goes forward to be, and it says that you have to have the Kundalini awakening. You have to[unclear] collective consciousness, and thoughtless awareness and ultimately you have to be connecting with the All-Pervading Power. That's what he calls as Ritambhara Pragnya. And you have to become doubtlessly aware, Nirvikalpa. So these are the three-four stages. But the main thing is that these people are taking part [unclear]. For example, if you say Hatha Yoga is a very big part, one-twenty-fourth of one part. So it's not conceivable.

But you see this is also, must have full idea as to where is the blocking, for which one are you doing yoga. If you start doing yoga like this, then you are taking all the medicines you see indiscriminately. It's a big science of understanding. So all these yoga systems, whatever is there, we used to be understood when the Kundalini starts moving, and you go where is the blocking actually, then whatever is needed is to be done. For example this Raja Yoga, we call it. Now Raja Yoga is also the same thing, as the start starts [unclear] and it starts working in such a way that all the things that are inside the car start working according to the need of the car. The same way with the Kundalini rises, then it should not fall down. So in every chakra, there is a bandhan stoping for falling, and the tongue it's a little bit pushed in, but you won't feel it. I mean if somebody is a master, you won't feel anything, you just take a realization like that. But this was all described.

Now so the what they did even up to this much, they started a Kriya Yoga, means that suppose it's Sahaja Yoga. Sahaja is spontaneous, Kriya is action yoga. They started action yoga and in the action yoga, they even cut the tongue. You see in America you'll find some people, their tongues are cut from here, the thread, and it's hanging on the end and just to push it back. The bigger artificial thing like if you take out the wheels of a car, will the car move? It has to get ignited. Ignition must be done, the car must get the ignition. What you say to the ignitions? Ignition in a car. So without that, if you start moving any instrument or anything, how can the car move?

Artificial? So all these people you see had very little knowledge here and there, some of them went to some great saints, and the saints then turned them off, they thought we are no good, they taught them little asanas, and that's what they're teaching. It's very dangerous. Sahaja Yoga is for everybody? Yes, of course. And it's so gentle, it's beautiful, it's a living process, it's all your own, it's your own power, and you rise the Kundalini which rises and pierces through your fontanel bone area that integrates itself. That's what it is that you have to have an actualization of the bautism. It's not artificial, it's something to put the water on your head, you have become, that applies, no is actualization, when you really feel the cool things of the Holy Ghost. And all the things that are said by all the prophets comes to you. Like even Mohammad Sahab has said that your hands should speak, then it should be the time of resurrection [unclear].

That's what is Sahaja Yoga. It has to be the actualization, it has to work, it has to move on your central nervous system. It's not just artificial, it's standing on your head.

Interviewer: And the only way to learn that is to put the centre, your centre, the books.

Shri Mataji: No, no, no, no, no, no. It's a living process. Now, supposing it's so vital that we should read, in the same way it is vital. And for anything vital, say, for your breathing, if you have to read books, what will happen? It's so vital, it's so important, it's a living process.

Interviewer: And a question that I want to explain to....I would say, leave the Sahaja yoga of how many, how long in every day you have to dedicate today.

Shri Mataji: No, nothing, it's just that moment, it happens. That moment, it happens. But to master it, you need little time to understand the coding and all that, takes about a month or two months. You can become a master yourself and you start giving realization.

Interviewer: Just a month, that is for everybody.

Shri Mataji: At the most. We don't have much time, you know. And God also doesn't have much time. He wants everybody to enter into his kingdom as fast as possible.

Interviewer: And in the brief biography that I have found, it's written that you discovered this kind of a Yoga on the [unclear], but before you passed it through different, I don't know.

Shri Mataji: No, no, no, no. You see, what I did was to.... This yoga was used since long, but one or two persons used to get realization in those days. Very few. Like you can say in the Tree of Life, there are one or two flowers. But I wanted to have a mass method by which masses are converted. So I worked through my own subtleties to find out what's wrong with human beings. You see, why? What's the problem?

Then I worked out the permutations and combinations, and then I opened the last chakra. By opening that, now everybody is waiting in the masses. It's a mass happening.

Interviewer: And I have read in some books that it can be dangerous to the kundalini.

Shri Mataji: Those who have no authority should not do it. You see, authority comes from God, not from human beings. So those people who are leading a dirty life, who are not pure people, they can't give realization. They have to know everything about Kundalini, they have to [unclear] raise Kundalini and all that, is dangerous because it is not actually the Kundalini which is dangerous, but there are other forces which work on you, if you try to do some sort of a funny thing. Like you put your hand in the plug, you get a shock. So you don't know how to do it.

Simple as that. Now we have had so many people realize, in your Italy we have so many people realize, that giving realization. No, nothing happens at all.

Interviewer: And are you not afraid to, permitted to write down on your brochure that some person with very strong illness, like cancer,

Shri Mataji: No, no, because we have proved it. We have proved it, not only that, but there are pieces now written on this thing in India and doctors have got MD degrees out of it. So it's a well known fact. And for your information, we went to Russia and the Russian government has accepted now Sahaja Yoga as an independent identity for us, because they have seen the results. Why should I be afraid? It's a fact.

Interviewer: I don't know, because in India, there is a kind of court of...It forms a kind of court of miracles, in other words, in a court of how to say it. It becomes like a kind of legend.

Shri Mataji: Legends have to be proved.

Interviewer: The data, let's say, of this research, there are studies in India that are found in these papers. No, we haven't seen them either. We have seen all the statistics.

Shri Mataji: No, in your country, look, [unclear] what was she suffering from? [unclear]

Yogi: Myasthenia gravis

Yogi: Myasthenia gravis

Shri Mataji: She is completely cured. She [unclear] Okay.

Yogi: Now you see the experiment

Shri Mataji: It's an incurable disease.
