 Yuvadrishti September 2008 NIRMAL VANI : Stithpragnya Achieving the state of Witnessing As Yuvashaktis, our minds are continuously bombarded with new ideas & impulses through various external media and from the society that we live in. They disturb our peace and imbalance us. The trick is to stay in witness while going through our schools, colleges or work. In this Nirmalvani, the Amrutdhara of our Mother's words shall guide us to that State. The Beauty of Witnessing There's this Chinese story about a saint. So one king brought his cock to him and said, "You train my cock in such a way that he should win." He said, "All right." So he kept the cock of the king for one month and when the show started, different cocks came from different places and they all started fighting. This cock just stood up and was watching, just watching. And other cocks got such a fright, they couldn't understand how this fellow is not disturbed, he's just watching, he's standing, he's doing nothing. So all they disappeared from the arena and he was declared as the successful one. It is a very important thing about the power of Shri Krishna that gives you a witness state. This is very important also because, in these days of Kali Yuga and complete confusion of value system, all kinds of turmoil makes a very complex conditions to exist. The state of witnessing is only possible through meditation: you reach the state of thoughtless awareness. It's combined together. Now the witness state is such a state where you just donot react. Now if you really become a witness state, if you are in a witness state, ther what will happen? If you watch any such things that are happening, it will subside. If you are in a witness state and if that level, then no accident will take place in your sight. Even if there is an accident, then you can save the person, you can help person very actively. That's in a very small scale, but even in a very large scale you can do it, something wonderful. [Ref# 1] the How Witness state is Spoiled But witness state is not a mental state, it is a state of a spiritual ascent where you become a witness, I've seen people who are all the time criticizing others. They cannot criticize themselves, so they start criticizing others. They don't even see what wrong they have done to others, because they think they have a right to criticize others, and they enjoy this criticism very well. Now one may say, "Mother, how does this ego build up in people?"" Of course, mstly it is due to reactions, also it is due to the conditioning. If the child is told from the childhood that "You should hate these people, they are to be hated. They are wrong people, they are bad people," they just start doing that. When they grow up they start showing that hatred is now like cactus growing very big, and is killing others. Actually there's nothing to be criticized. You just watch and see for yourself. That's all is your right. You have no right to criticize anyone or anything. But some people think if you do not criticize, then it will go on like

 Yuvadrishti September 2008 this and it will never stop. It's not thatl Once you wvatch the thing yourself, only just watch. Your attention itself is enlightened now, with that enlightened attention you can just watch and stop the nonsense that is there. But we are always conscious that we are something great, and we have to do this and we have to do that. Under these circumstances what happens is that you become another problem. Because what can you do? You can't do anything. But what you can do is to watch. By watching and by just seeing things as they are, you really develop a very differentstate of being. Now you being Sahaja Yogis, your worth is great. You have come here to emancipate human beings from these silly ideas and foolish ways, the way people are behaving. One doesn't know why people react like that, and then why do we worry about what people react? All these things are not only on individual level, but also on a collective level. As a result, you see, new kinds of value system has been created. Now for a mother would think she is a great actress. They are so much engrossed or they are so much standing on the basis that they have to be extremely attractive. Same with the men. You see, if you have something within you, if there is any quality within you, is there anything that can qualify you as a great man, it will be showing. You don't have to advertise. [Ref# 1] In Sahaja Yoga also I have seen people want to show off a lot. [Ref# 2] Everybody seems to be very knowledgeable and start telling what is best and what is not the best, what is not good. And once they start saying something like that, mind becomes reflective. If the mind is not reflective, then you are in thoughtless awareness. While if you react onto everything, your memory becomes horrible. Now a mother's desire is always that children should have nothing but peace and joy, no sufferings, no starvation, no ordeals, nothing. They must just enjoy. Now those days are gone. But even to enjoy this, even to live in that complete peaceful state you have to benon-reflecting. [Ref# 3] The Joy of Witness State Firstly all such people who are just witnessing, what happens to them is very interesting, that their memory loss is much less, because whatever they see becomes like a picture to them. Like you can say, they can tell you even the colour, the folding, everything. Whatever they see is so much in their mind like a photo, and they can tell you exactly what they have seen, and your memory is not lost. While if you react onto everything, your memory becomes horrible. Once you do not react to outside you start reacting to inside, and introspection will start properly. When you see yourself you'll be amazed how admiring you are, how happy you are. Now if you go beyond thata little more, then you don't think of all these things. You just become thoughtless and you just stand up as a person who is respected, whose company is wanted, who is loved and who is cared for. So one should not worry as to what people react, what they say about you, what they think about you, You should justintrospect and see for yourself. After some time you don't need even introspection. will find yourself a very, very powerful person in the sense you'll have no ambitions, you'll have no desires, you'll have no special fondness or anything. But just you are witnessing the drama. [Ref# 2] There's no ripple of thought in your mind. Then you become extremely creative. You become extremely dynamic, you become extremely compassionate. You have no fear. [Ref# 3] you 2, জ

 Yuvadrishti September 2008 Getting the Witness State So your witness state has to be developed and sometimes I have seen people have to go through little difficulties to develop that witness state. [Ref# 3] This is very important that once the Kundalini starts supplying you from your Sahasrara downward, moving on your chakras and enriching your different chakras, on the Vishuddhi chakra, when it has to stay, it really tries to, little bit, take you through turmoil; and you start thinking that "See now, my life was so blissful, I had so many blessings, and now what has happened?" But this is the time when you should become tatastha, means you should become a witness, if you become a witness everything improves. You have become now walis, you have becomenow realised souls, you have become now atmajas. You have got Brahmachaitanya, you have seen on your heads there was light, you have seen the proof of it. SoI don't have to give you a second certificate. Only thing, you better understand and be aware of your own position, as Shri Krishna has said, "You have to be aware of your Self." First to get self-realisation and then to be aware of your position. Then you'll be surprised how you develop proper attention and proper understanding. Absolutely it is an easy thing to do as soon as you find that you have achieved that witness state. [Ref#2] This sets in, this reflection, sets in waves of thoughts in our mind. I have already, once, described it by drawing. How the energy that falls on the right side goes to the left side and the falls on the left goes to the right. Crosses over because of two types of cells we have. Then out of this energy that goes to the right, the energy that goes to the left it is sucked in partly into the sympathetic, Now whatever is left out is the one that reflects. That is the way it goes on reflecting. Now if you can suck in all that energy and put it on our sympathetic, then all our energies will be thousand fold much more. We'll not be tired, we'll notbe unhappy, we'll be able to stand lots of nonsense. But we'll not call it a nonsense, we'll not think it's a bad thing, so it has no effect on us. To be one with that state you have to be absolutely silent within yourself. For the Goddess, She is silent. There's a fight on, She's silent, because She's so confident. She knows about Her powers. She knows Mahishasura or any asura cannot trouble Her, cannot touch Her. She knows what are their powers are and She knows all Her powers. So She doesn't have to be disturbed by anything. She's not disturbed because She's really the personification of this peace state, where She's so powerful. She doesn'thave to know about Her powers. She doesn't have to ask the powers to exert, they just work, automatically [Ref# 3] Shri Krishna told Arjuna that "I will not fight. So in between Me and the army, My army, you have to select." So Kauravas said, "No, we'll take Your army, Your army. You give us Your army and we'll strengthen our army." But Arjuna said, "I don't want army, I want You. You don't want to fight, it's all right." Because though He will be there in a witness state only, He won't be fighting but His power will act. He doesn't have to fight, He doesn't have to do anything, but His own power which is outwardly is silent but will act, and that is how we will win the war. [Ref# 1] Like thesemountains how they are steadily watching everything and emittingjoy and beauty. I wish you all very great luck for your witness state.

 Yuvadrishti September 2008 हरियाणा में सहजयोग होरयाणा हरियाणा जैसे कि इसके नाम से विदित है एक हरित प्रदेश के नाम से जाना जाता है और इसके हरित होने के बारे में श्री माताजी भी बता चुकी है कि यहाँ पर शाकुम्भरा देवी की कृपा है। बताया कि वह कभी भी गर्भ धारण नहीं कर पायेगी। उस लड़की ने दो साल अपनी भाभी के लिये ध्यान किया और श्रीमाताजी एक रात उसके स्वपन में आए और उसे कहा, तेरे घर तुम्हारी भाभी को २१ मार्च को बेटा होगा।" फिर २१ मार्च को उनके घर बेटा हुआ! (हम सभी जानते है २१ मार्च को हमारी प्रेममयी माँ का सांसारिक जन्मदिन होता है।) इन सब बातों से ज्यादा उस लड़की ने एक महत्वपूर्ण बात बताई कि लोग उसका मज़ाक बनाते हैं, "बिना फोटो के किसका ध्यान करती हो?तुम किसी से बिना मिले, उसे बिना जाने कैसे उन्हें मान सकती हो ?" तब उसने बताया, "परमात्मा को कितने लोगों ने देखा है पर सारा संसार उनसे प्रेम करता है, मैं तो फिर भी उनकी शक्ति को चारों और महसूस कर सकती हूँ।' हरियाणा राज्य में सहजयोग के प्रचार प्रसार में बहुत प्रयत्न किये जा रहे हैं। २००७ तक हरियाणा के किसी भी गाँव में सहजयोग ध्यान केन्द्र नहीं था। गाँव में ध्यान केन्द्र खोलने के लिए सभी प्रयासरत थे। श्री माताजी की कृपा से २००७ में करनाल के पास इन्द्रों में एक बड़ा सार्वजनिक कार्यक्रम आयोजित किया गया और पिछले १८ महीनों से वहाँ पर ध्यान केन्द्र चलाया जा रहा है। इन्द्रों के अच्छे परिणाम देखते हुए पिछले एक साल में हरियाणा के बहुत से गाँवों में ध्यान केन्द्र खोले जा चुके हैं। जिनको प्रारम्भ करने में यमुनानगर सामूहिकया की मुख्य भूमिका रही है। मट् च ंप के टट श नि क डबकौली गाँव में आत्मसाक्षात्कार के दौरान विशुद्धि चक्र शुद्ध करने पर आकाश में बहुत मोटी नीली रेखा देखी गई जिसे सभी गाँव वालों ने भी देखा। हरियाणा में सभी कार्यक्रम से पहले प्रकृति ने भी अपना कार्य किया और भारी बारिश सभी कार्यक्रमों से पहले डबकोली, मुजाफल, बिलासपुर इत्यादि प्रमुख हैं। इन सभी हुई। कार्यक्रम शुरू होने से पहले बारिश रुक जाती थी। स्थानों पर कार्यक्रम करते हुए कुछ चमत्कार भी देखने व सुनने फरीदाबाद में भी सहजयोग के कार्य जोर शोर से किये जा रहे हरियाणा सहजयोग के ग्रामीण राज्य संयोजक श्री जी.के. दत्ता के प्रयासों द्वारा पिछले एक महीने में तीन गाँवों में कार्यक्रम किये जा चुके हैं और वहाँ पर ध्यान केन्द्र स्थापित किये गये हैं जिन्में बृदढियाँ गाँव, ते में आयें। हैं। फरीदाबाद सामूहिकता द्वारा गाँव में बहुत से कार्यक्रम किऐे बूढियाँ के कार्यक्रम के दौरान एक २० वर्षीय लड़की ने गये हैं और बहुत जगह नये ध्यान केन्द्र स्थापित किये गये है। बताया कि वह अपने भाई के कहने पर गाँव में ही दो सहज कार्यक्रमों में युवाशक्ति दवारा देखी गई कठिनाईयाँ साल से श्रीमाताजी का ध्यान कर रही है उसने सिर्फ माँ का फोटो देखा था और ध्यान के लिये श्रीमाताजी का गाँवां में अकसर यह देखा गया है कि लोग बहुत रूड़ीवादी होते कोई चित्र नहीं था। उस लड़की की भाभी का नवजात है जो प्रायः कुगुरूओं के प्रभाव में भी होते हैं। गाँव में लोगों के शिशु मर गया था तथा डाक्टर लोगों ने उसकी भाभी को पास समय बहुत कम होता है। वे कुण्डलिनी के बारे में जानते ২ 5

 मान Yuvadrishti September 2008 नहीं हैं गाँव के लोग प्रायः अपने जीवन से संतुष्ट होते हैं। वे परमात्मा के विषय में जानने के लिये भी ज्यादा जिज्ञासु नहीं होते। गाँव में लोग अंधविश्वास भी ज्यादा करते हैं और चमत्कार में विश्वास करते हैं। गाँव के लोग अपनी बीमारियाँ, फसलें ठीक करने के बारे में ज्यादा चित्त रखते हें। उन्हें मानव चैतन्य की अमृत वर्षा कर रही थी। माँ की चरण पादुकाएँ जैसे ही बस से उतारी जाती तो सहजयोगियों द्वारा स्वागत आगत स्वागतम् गाकर स्वागत किया जाता। उस समय सभी सहजयोगियों द्वारा अतयन्त शीतल चैतन्य लहरियाँ महसूस की जाती। चक्रों के बारे में जानने में रुचि नहीं होती। गाँव में लोग जमीन जहाँ पर भी यात्रा गई हर सहजयोगी उनको अपने सहस्त्रार पर रखने के लिए ललायित था। चरण पादुकाओं को सहस्त्रार पर से जुड़े होने के कारण सामान्य जीवन के साथ समझौता नहीं कर पाते। रखते ही सहस्त्रार बर्फ की तरह ठण्डा हो जाता। इसलिए गाँवों में प्रचार-प्रसार करते हुए निम्नलिखित बातों का ध्यान रखना चाहिए- हरियाणा सहजयोग चेतना यात्रा हरियाणा राज्य सहजयोग संयोजक (State Coordinator) श्री के डी महाजन द्वारा संगठित की गई। इस यात्रा के दो चरण बनाए गए। दोनों यात्राएँ दस दिनों के क्रार्यक्रम के लिए रवाना हुई और दोनों ही चरण एक साथ शुरू हुए। जहाँ-जहाँ यात्रा पहुँची वहाँ पर रथ यात्रा निकाली गई एवं सार्वजनिक क्रार्यक्रम के बाद वहाँ पर अनुवर्ती क्रार्यक्रम भी किए १. गाँवों में कार्यक्रम से पहले दो बार गाँवों में निरीक्षण होना चाहिये। पर्चे कार्यक्रम से पहले जरूर बॉटे जाने चाहिये। ्टट की २. पर्चे बाँटने के दौरान सहजयोग के बारे में जरूर बताना चाहिये कय्योंकि गाँव में लोग कम पढे-लिखे होते हैं। तिए का टट ्ट्ट्टी गए। ३. कार्यक्रम का समय उनकी यात्रा का पहला चरण कालका से शुरू होकर पिजौंर, कुरूक्षेत्र, नरवाणा, पेहवा, कैथल, पानीपत, करनाल, यमुनानगर, अम्बाला होते हुए पचंकुला में यमनिका पार्क में सार्वजनिक क्रार्यक्रम के साथ समाप्त हुआ। धन सुविधा अनुसार तय करना चाहिये। ४. गाँव में लोगों को टीवी का आकर्षण होता है। वे टीवी पर कही गई बात को ध्यान से सुनते हैं। अतः ना स्च मजे े ी गांव में projector का इन्तजाम करना चाहिये। TDT:O_BLURRY इसी प्रकार यात्रा का दूसरा चरण फरीदाबाद से शुरू होकर होडल, सोहना, रेवाड़ी, महेन्द्रगढ़, गुड़गाँव, रोहतक, हिसार, फतियाबाद, सिरसा, डबवाली में समाप्त हुआ। ५. हो सके तो आत्मसाक्षात्कार के लिए श्रीमाताजी की सीडी चलाई जानी चाहिये। का ६. अनुवर्ती कार्यक्रम (Follow up) जरूर रखा जाना चाहिये । यात्रा के लिए दो बसें निर्धारित की गई जिन्में ५५ लोग थे, जिसमें सभी सेन्टर के युवा-शक्ति, वयस्क पुरूष और महिलाएँ शामिल थे दोनों बसों में प्रोजेक्टर का प्रबंध किया गया। हर सार्वजनिक क्रार्यक्रम में आत्मसाक्षात्कार श्री माताजी की C.D. ७. गाँव में ही ध्यान केन्द्र स्थापित किया जाना चाहिये। हरियाणा चेतना यात्रा चेतना यात्रा श्री माताजी की कृपा से उन्हीं के चित्त में शुरु हुई। चैतना यात्रा में श्री माताजी की चरण पादकाएँ (जो शरी चलाकर दिया गया। म दोनों यात्राओं ने नवरात्री पूजा सामूहिक रूप में गुड़गाँव में माताज़ी द्वारा दुबई से मिज़वाई गई थीं और बाद में भारत आने पर श्री माताजी ने यात्रा की सराहाना की) के साथ रवाना हुई। परम वदनीय माँ की चरण पादुकाएँ विभिन्न स्थानों पर मनाई। चेतना यात्रा का समापन यमनिका पार्क (पंचकुला) में हुआ, उस दिन श्री सिंपल राजा और डा राजेश द्वारा भजन न ২ e 9 ১

Because when you are precariously placed, when there is immediate danger to your existence, at this time when the whole world is standing at a precarious position where it is going to be destroyed completely. It is very important that you cling on to things that is going to save you, with complete might and complete faith. Like you are getting drenched in ordinary water doesn't matter, but if you are sinking in the sea, as there is question of this moment of existence and that moment of destruction, that time if a hand comes forward to fetch you out, there is no time to think any more but cling on to it with all your might, with all your faith. 1982-0731:Dedication through Meditation, Cowley Manor Seminar, England ২০ ১-

 Yuvadrishti September 2008 RENDEZVOUS Discussions with Sahaj Yogi Brother When & how you got Realization amd when was Q-1 seeking manifested? And how were these overcome? Sahajayogi Brother: Basically, in Sahaja Yoga for a true seeker, difficulties and problems have lost their meaning. The Divine system is so spontaneous and self responding that such difficulties are mostly taken care of, if one is duly surrendered and is able to get into thoughtless meditation regularly. But in the beginning the following difficulties were generally experienced: Sahajayogi Brother: It was with the Grace of Her Holiness Shri Mataji that I was chosen to get inducted into Sahaja Yoga during May/ June 1988 in Kanpur. A French Sahaja Yogi & his wife raised my Kundalini. During those days Iwas passing through an extremely stressful phase of my life, since suddenly I had to face too many shocking and inevitable challenges in my personal life. Worst being the misery of losing my wife when the two children were only 9 & 14 years old and that too when I had not fully come out of the set back of my father's demise only a couple of months before. Ge Nothoughtlessness & No Vibrations 2 Lack of time for regular meditation or Sahaja work and even the know-how of correctly doing self clearance etc. There were no Sahaja Yogi or Sahaja Centre in & around Kanpur during those days for our follow up a Lack of confidence in talking about Sahaja Yoga guidance. Hence, my vertical growth was very slow. However, by the Grace of Her Holiness, within ca Financial constraints in running the weeks I could experience pleasant joy during evening meditations. Apparently, that might have been the subtle beginning of my seeking, which at that stage I had not been able to distinctly identify as there were no vibrations felt in my palms. a The pressure of fulfilling the assigned role of Gradually, by Her Grace, we started growing horizontally and in a couple of months we were about 10-12 members' collectivity trying to organise As we grew with the limited knowledge and weekly sessions while listening to Shri Mataji's experience, we could gradually appreciate the speech from some editions of 'Anand Lok' importance of humble, truthful and meaningful (Chaitanya Lahiri & speech cassettes were not surrendering and of honest prayers in meditation available). For further guidance we had been with innocence, sanctity and dedication. Eventually, visiting Delhi and attended Public programmes, to our surprise we found that our true desires were Seminars, Pujas etc. I could experience real growth getting automatically fulfilled, problems getting only after about 9-10 months, when I got the great solved and our doubts & queries were being opportunity of getting introduced to our Divine spontaneously answered.

 Yuvadrishti September 2008 meaningfully with full respects as though our Holy Mother is physically present in 'sakaar'. One should achieve thoughtless state every time. One must continuously update the knowledge and skill of practicing Sahaja Yoga by reading/ listening/ watching Shri Mataji's speeches. One can enhance spiritual knowledge also by reading scriptures and works of past incarnations, saints. Inspite of learning that Ego & Super-ego are the worst enemies in our ascent, we are not able to meaningfully practice & keep them out from our life. Consequently, when we do Sahaja activities we forget the fact that Shri Mataji is the only Doer, not we. Hence, all yuvashaktis should take initiative in carrying out Sahaja work with humility & responsibility, with the objective of pleasing Shri Mataji. Cleansing of badhas as indicated should be a routine Need to put attention on smaller centres for the practice. The principle should be to 'Nip in the bud' benefit of immature yuvashaktis.

Dedicated yuvashaktis should take initiative to ensure a decent Sahaja environment and a healthy mutual relationship among the collectivity. ii. Matured yuvashaktis should form a team for ensuring vertical growth of collectivity through well planned Structured Programs, Seminars, Workshops etc. Sahajayogi Brother: Our revered Holy Mother has repeatedly been pronouncing that She has blessed us with all the knowledge, experience and power required for spreading Sahaja Yoga across the globe. She expects the Yuva Shaktis in particular to carry the torch with responsibility and enlighten all the seekers who are awaiting. Therefore, one has to become a worthy instrument for such pious divine work.

Divine Kid Priya McCairns around the breakfast table we were discussing how we needed to call all the parents of the children, that would be coming today for meditation, and let them It is such a pleasure to see how Sahaja Yoga is working out here in the USA. About 3 months ago, at our kids' school, my wife know that it would be cancelled. When suddenly I Leela was asked by one of the teachers, if she would found myself saying, "Why cancel the class?

So, Leela agreed. him to Mother, She will cure him, so then again all children prayed for this child to help him cure faster. She told us this experience and we were so amazed...

 Yuvadrishti September 2008 Living Honestly III Truth is above everything. Highest is truthful living. Guru Nanak Dev was a successful shopkeeper in his village, Talwandi. Because of his honesty and integrity, he was appointed manager of the government stores at Sultanpur Lodhi, in Punjab, on the banks of the river Bayeen. This was a job of great responsibility as large stores and stocks were involved in government dealings. One could easily misappropriate lots of money or stores. Junior officials were usually not very sincere, On the contrary, they were quite often dishonest. All residents of the town were satisfied with the good dealings of Guru Nanak Dev.

If we are in balance she (Mother the main purpose of Yuva Shakti is the development Earth) herself can take care of Global Warming". of our own personality in order to make it much Eye-opening!! more complete, so that all of us prove to be great Then, there was a session of dumb charades for assets to Sahaja yoga and serve as shining ideals for which we used names on cassettes of Shri Mataji's other to emulate and derive inspiration.

 Yuvadrishti September 2008 Discipline I do not want to put too much restriction on children in the name of discipline, in the beginning, because children are themselves very disciplined. But discipline has to be there. If you follow the practice of getting up in the moning time, slowly you will find children cannot sleep after that time. All these good habits can be done. To sleep earlier, to get up early, not to talk too much, not become also absolutely deaf and dumb sort, not to talk rubbish, not to be frivolous, not to be sarcastic. All these things can be watched very carefully. Children must know how to behave themselves, they must know how to answer, how much they must talk. Do not spoil them with presents. Give them presents at the right time and tell them how they should behave. This is your duty to discipline them. No child should be allowed to answer back. Teach them to be respectful. If you do not teach them, they will be disrespectful to other people. Sit down with them one hour and talk to them, not in the presence of others. If they break the toys and all that, tell them that "if you are breaking toys you are not going to get them." Keep them properly, arrange them, let them organise. This is how you train. Another habit children must form is to get up early in the morning and wash. The parents must get up in the morning. Give them bath, get them ready. Do not give tea to children, but milk. Tea is not a good habit. You have to tell your children, until they are sixteen years of age, everything that is good, righteous, how to behave and how to live. Otherwise, they become vagabonds. "Oh, we can do whatever we want, what is wrong?" You teach them what is wrong. Do not give them money, Let them do the work. You should never pay for your children's work. Do not run after the children all the time, because once they know they are dominating you, they will sit on your heads. They should know where they stand with you. Gradually they will learn and behave. Either you make them human beings or you make them devils. Itis in your hands. Children should know that you love them. Do little things that show that you care. Express your love. The only fear they have is that they will lose that love. Love must be expressed. This is the main thing that they have to be given all the time. Address them like someone higher. Respect and love, that is the point, rather than beating them. To give a lot of love is the first priority, then the discipline. Children should not be allowed to form habits. They should not get used to too much comfort. They should attend to others, bring things for others and always be busy with someone. We should not make the children work too hard. In India, the whole society trains the attention of the child by continually pointing the attention to the correct things. It is not wise to make the child agitated all the time and enter into a sort of competition. Let the child grow normally. Source-Education Enlightened, HH Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi

NIRMAL VANI : Stithpragnya
Achieving the state of Witnessing
As Yuvashaktis, our minds are continuously
bombarded with new ideas & impulses through
various external media and from the society that
we live in. They disturb our peace and
imbalance us. The trick is to stay in witness
while going through our schools, colleges or
work. In this Nirmalvani, the Amrutdhara of
our Mother's words shall guide us to that State.
The Beauty of Witnessing
There's this Chinese story about a saint. So
one king brought his cock to him and said,
"You train my cock in such a way that he should win." He said, "All right." So he kept the cock of the king for
one month and when the show started, different cocks came from different places and they all started
fighting. This cock just stood up and was watching, just watching. And other cocks got such a fright, they
couldn't understand how this fellow is not disturbed, he's just watching, he's standing, he's doing nothing.
So all they disappeared from the arena and he was declared as the successful one.
It is a very important thing about the power of Shri Krishna that gives you a witness state. This is very
important also because, in these days of Kali Yuga and complete confusion of value system, all kinds of
turmoil makes a very complex conditions to exist. The state of witnessing is only possible through
meditation: you reach the state of thoughtless awareness. It's combined together. Now the witness state is
such a state where you just donot react.
Now if you really become a witness state, if you are in a witness state, ther what will happen? If you watch
any such things that are happening, it will subside. If you are in a witness state and if that level, then no
accident will take place in your sight. Even if there is an accident, then you can save the person, you can help
person very actively. That's in a very small scale, but even in a very large scale you can do it, something
wonderful. [Ref# 1]
the
How Witness state is Spoiled
But witness state is not a mental state, it is a state of a spiritual ascent where you become a witness, I've seen
people who are all the time criticizing others. They cannot criticize themselves, so they start criticizing
others. They don't even see what wrong they have done to others, because they think they have a right to
criticize others, and they enjoy this criticism very well. Now one may say, "Mother, how does this ego build
up in people?"" Of course, mstly it is due to reactions, also it is due to the conditioning. If the child is told
from the childhood that "You should hate these people, they are to be hated. They are wrong people, they are
bad people," they just start doing that. When they grow up they start showing that hatred is now like
cactus growing very big, and is killing others.
Actually there's nothing to be criticized. You just watch and see for yourself. That's all is your right. You have
no right to criticize anyone or anything. But some people think if you do not criticize, then it will go on like
 2008_Yuvadrishti_Mx_(Scan)_III.pdf-page-5.txt 
 Yuvadrishti September 2008
this and it will never stop. It's not thatl Once you wvatch the
thing yourself, only just watch. Your attention itself is
enlightened now, with that enlightened attention you can just
watch and stop the nonsense that is there. But we are always
conscious that we are something great, and we have to do this
and we have to do that. Under these circumstances what
happens is that you become another problem. Because what
can you do? You can't do anything. But what you can do is to
watch. By watching and by just seeing things as they are, you
really develop a very differentstate of being.
Now you being Sahaja Yogis, your worth is great. You have
come here to emancipate human beings from these silly ideas
and foolish ways, the way people are behaving. One doesn't
know why people react like that, and then why do we worry
about what people react? All these things are not only on
individual level, but also on a collective level. As a result, you
see, new kinds of value system has been created. Now for a mother would think she is a great actress. They
are so much engrossed or they are so much standing on the basis that they have to be extremely attractive.
Same with the men. You see, if you have something within you, if there is any quality within you, is there
anything that can qualify you as a great man, it will be showing. You don't have to advertise. [Ref# 1]
In Sahaja Yoga also I have seen people want to show off a lot. [Ref# 2] Everybody seems to be very
knowledgeable and start telling what is best and what is not the best, what is not good. And once they start
saying something like that, mind becomes reflective. If the mind is not reflective, then you are in thoughtless
awareness. While if you react onto everything, your memory becomes horrible. Now a mother's desire is
always that children should have nothing but peace and joy, no sufferings, no starvation, no ordeals,
nothing. They must just enjoy. Now those days are gone. But even to enjoy this, even to live in that complete
peaceful state you have to benon-reflecting. [Ref# 3]
The Joy of Witness State
Firstly all such people who are just witnessing, what happens to them is very interesting, that their memory
loss is much less, because whatever they see becomes like a picture to them. Like you can say, they can tell
you even the colour, the folding, everything. Whatever they see is so much in their mind like a photo, and
they can tell you exactly what they have seen, and your memory is not lost. While if you react onto
everything, your memory becomes horrible.
Once you do not react to outside you start reacting to inside, and introspection will start properly. When you
see yourself you'll be amazed how admiring you are, how happy you are. Now if you go beyond thata little
more, then you don't think of all these things. You just become thoughtless and you just stand up as a person
who is respected, whose company is wanted, who is loved and who is cared for. So one should not worry as
to what people react, what they say about you, what they think about you, You should justintrospect and see
for yourself. After some time you don't need even introspection.
will find yourself a very, very powerful person in the sense you'll have no ambitions, you'll have no
desires, you'll have no special fondness or anything. But just you are witnessing the drama. [Ref# 2] There's
no ripple of thought in your mind. Then you become extremely creative. You become extremely dynamic,
you become extremely compassionate. You have no fear. [Ref# 3]

Getting the Witness State
So your witness state has to be developed and sometimes I have seen people have to go through little
difficulties to develop that witness state. [Ref# 3] This is very important that once the Kundalini starts
supplying you from your Sahasrara downward, moving on your chakras and enriching your different
chakras, on the Vishuddhi chakra, when it has to stay, it really tries to, little bit, take you through turmoil;
and you start thinking that "See now, my life was so blissful, I had so many blessings, and now what has
happened?" But this is the time when you should become tatastha, means you should become a witness, if
you become a witness everything improves.
You have become now walis, you have becomenow realised souls, you have become now atmajas. You have
got Brahmachaitanya, you have seen on your heads there was light, you have seen the proof of it. SoI don't
have to give you a second certificate. Only thing, you better understand and be aware of your own position,
as Shri Krishna has said, "You have to be aware of your Self." First to get self-realisation and then to be aware
of your position. Then you'll be surprised how you develop proper attention and proper understanding.
Absolutely it is an easy thing to do as soon as you find that you have achieved that witness state. [Ref#2]
This sets in, this reflection, sets in waves of thoughts in our mind. I have already, once, described it by
drawing. How the energy that falls on the right side goes to the left side and the falls on the left goes to the
right. Crosses over because of two types of cells we have. Then out of this energy that goes to the right, the
energy that goes to the left it is sucked in partly into the sympathetic, Now whatever is left out is the one that
reflects. That is the way it goes on reflecting. Now if you can suck in all that energy and put it on our
sympathetic, then all our energies will be thousand fold much more. We'll not be tired, we'll notbe unhappy,
we'll be able to stand lots of nonsense. But we'll not call it a nonsense, we'll not think it's a bad thing, so it has
no effect on us.
To be one with that state you have to be absolutely silent within yourself. For the Goddess, She is silent.
There's a fight on, She's silent, because She's so confident. She knows about Her powers. She knows
Mahishasura or any asura cannot trouble Her, cannot touch Her. She knows what are their powers are and
She knows all Her powers. So She doesn't have to be disturbed by anything. She's not disturbed because
She's really the personification of this peace state, where She's so powerful. She doesn'thave to know about
Her powers. She doesn't have to ask the powers to exert, they just work, automatically [Ref# 3]
Shri Krishna told Arjuna that "I will not fight. So in between Me and the army, My army, you have to select."
So Kauravas said, "No, we'll take Your army, Your army. You give us Your army and we'll strengthen our
army." But Arjuna said, "I don't want army, I want You. You don't want to fight, it's all right." Because
though He will be there in a witness state only, He won't be fighting but His power will act. He doesn't have
to fight, He doesn't have to do anything, but His own power which is outwardly is silent but will act, and
that is how we will win the war. [Ref# 1]
Like thesemountains how they are steadily watching everything and emittingjoy and beauty.
I wish you all very great luck for your witness state. [Ref# 2]

माताजी सुन्दरलगरहे थे। मंच पर श्री माताजी के लिए
बैठने के लिए कोई खास सिंहासन का प्रबन्ध नहीं था
पर श्री माताजी ने तखत पर बैठना पसन्द किया। उस
समय श्री माताजी तख्त पर जैसे बैठे थे, वो बिल्कुल श्री
विष्णु अगवान का रूप दिखा रहे थे। हरियाणा की
स्वास्थ्य मंत्री श्रीमती कमला वर्मा भी इस कार्यक्रम में
पहुँची थीं। फिर श्री माताजी ने अपना प्रवचन दिया और
जब प्रवचन खत्म किया तो सभी लोग उठकर जाने
लगे। श्री माताजी ने सभी से कहा, 'बस, आप लोग
केवल प्रवचन सुनने ही आए थे? जो में तम्हे देने आई े
उसे तो लकेर जाओ।'यहसुनकर सब लागे बैठेऔर श्री
माताजीब्ारा आत्मसाक्षात्कारका कार्यक्रम हुआ।
औ्रीकृष्ण पुजा
यह पूजा यमुना नही के किनारे हथनी कुंड जगह पर
हुई। २०0 के करीब विदेशी सहजयोगी पूजा लेने के
लिए यहाँ पहुँचे पूजा से पहले श्री माताजी की रथयात्रा
अग्वाल धर्मशाला से शुरु होकर पेपर मिल ग्राउंड पर
समाप्त हुई। जिसमें करीब 900 लोगों ने भाग लिया
श्रीकृष्ण पूजा साकार में ढोपहरको समाप्त हुई। जिसमें
१०८ बच्चों ने श्री माताजी के श्रीचरण धोये और श्री
माताजी द्वारा ५६ ओग चैतन्टयित किया गया। उस
समयरात में भयंकर सी में खूले में लकडियाँ जलाई

गई और उसके चारों ओर सहजयोगियों ने नृत्य
किया। श्री माताजी पूरे समय वाहाँ रहे। कार्यक्रम देर
रात के र बजे तक चला। श्री माताजी अपने बच्चों के
साथकाफी प्रसन्न लगरहे थे। वह सारा समय स्मरणीय
रहा। श्री माताजी ने नीले रंग की सजावट पहनी हुई
थी और सजावट भी नीले रंग का ही था। प्रेममयी माँ
टाह सार्वजनिक कार्यक्रम यमुनानगर के गीता भवन
मंदिर में हुआ था। इसके अलावा श्री माताजी की कृपा
से यहाँ ढो और सार्वजनिक कार्यक्रम पेपर मिल ग्राउंड

हरियाणा में सहजयोग
होरयाणा
हरियाणा जैसे कि इसके नाम से विदित है एक हरित प्रदेश के
नाम से जाना जाता है और इसके हरित होने के बारे में श्री
माताजी भी बता चुकी है कि यहाँ पर शाकुम्भरा देवी की कृपा
है।
बताया कि वह कभी भी गर्भ धारण नहीं कर पायेगी। उस
लड़की ने दो साल अपनी भाभी के लिये ध्यान किया और
श्रीमाताजी एक रात उसके स्वपन में आए और उसे कहा,
तेरे घर तुम्हारी भाभी को २१ मार्च को बेटा होगा।"
फिर २१ मार्च को उनके घर बेटा हुआ! (हम सभी जानते
है २१ मार्च को हमारी प्रेममयी माँ का सांसारिक जन्मदिन
होता है।) इन सब बातों से ज्यादा
उस लड़की ने एक महत्वपूर्ण बात
बताई कि लोग उसका मज़ाक बनाते
हैं, "बिना फोटो के किसका ध्यान
करती हो?तुम किसी से बिना मिले,
उसे बिना जाने कैसे उन्हें मान
सकती हो ?" तब उसने बताया,
"परमात्मा को कितने लोगों ने देखा
है पर सारा संसार उनसे प्रेम करता
है, मैं तो फिर भी उनकी शक्ति को
चारों और महसूस कर सकती हूँ।'
हरियाणा राज्य में सहजयोग के प्रचार प्रसार में बहुत प्रयत्न
किये जा रहे हैं। २००७ तक हरियाणा के किसी भी गाँव में
सहजयोग ध्यान केन्द्र नहीं था। गाँव में
ध्यान केन्द्र खोलने के लिए सभी
प्रयासरत थे। श्री माताजी की कृपा से
२००७ में करनाल के पास इन्द्रों में
एक बड़ा सार्वजनिक कार्यक्रम
आयोजित किया गया और पिछले १८
महीनों से वहाँ पर ध्यान केन्द्र चलाया
जा रहा है। इन्द्रों के अच्छे परिणाम
देखते हुए पिछले एक साल में
हरियाणा के बहुत से गाँवों में ध्यान
केन्द्र खोले जा चुके हैं। जिनको प्रारम्भ
करने में यमुनानगर सामूहिकया की
मुख्य भूमिका रही है।

बताया कि वह अपने भाई के कहने पर गाँव में ही दो सहज कार्यक्रमों में युवाशक्ति दवारा देखी गई कठिनाईयाँ
साल से श्रीमाताजी का ध्यान कर रही है उसने सिर्फ माँ
का फोटो देखा था और ध्यान के लिये श्रीमाताजी का गाँवां में अकसर यह देखा गया है कि लोग बहुत रूड़ीवादी होते
कोई चित्र नहीं था। उस लड़की की भाभी का नवजात है जो प्रायः कुगुरूओं के प्रभाव में भी होते हैं। गाँव में लोगों के
शिशु मर गया था तथा डाक्टर लोगों ने उसकी भाभी को पास समय बहुत कम होता है। वे कुण्डलिनी के बारे में जानते

नहीं हैं गाँव के लोग प्रायः अपने जीवन से संतुष्ट होते हैं। वे
परमात्मा के विषय में जानने के लिये भी ज्यादा जिज्ञासु नहीं
होते। गाँव में लोग अंधविश्वास भी ज्यादा करते हैं और
चमत्कार में विश्वास करते हैं। गाँव के लोग अपनी बीमारियाँ,
फसलें ठीक करने के बारे में ज्यादा चित्त रखते हें। उन्हें मानव
चैतन्य की अमृत वर्षा कर रही थी। माँ की चरण पादुकाएँ जैसे
ही बस से उतारी जाती तो सहजयोगियों द्वारा स्वागत आगत
स्वागतम् गाकर स्वागत किया जाता। उस समय सभी
सहजयोगियों द्वारा अतयन्त शीतल चैतन्य लहरियाँ महसूस की
जाती।
चक्रों के बारे में जानने में रुचि नहीं होती। गाँव में लोग जमीन
जहाँ पर भी यात्रा गई हर सहजयोगी उनको अपने सहस्त्रार पर
रखने के लिए ललायित था। चरण पादुकाओं को सहस्त्रार पर
से जुड़े होने के कारण सामान्य जीवन के साथ समझौता नहीं
कर पाते।
रखते ही सहस्त्रार बर्फ की तरह ठण्डा हो जाता।
इसलिए गाँवों में प्रचार-प्रसार करते हुए निम्नलिखित बातों का
ध्यान रखना चाहिए-
हरियाणा सहजयोग चेतना यात्रा हरियाणा राज्य सहजयोग

हरियाणा चेतना यात्रा
चेतना यात्रा श्री माताजी की कृपा से उन्हीं के चित्त में शुरु हुई।
चैतना यात्रा में श्री माताजी की चरण पादकाएँ (जो शरी चलाकर दिया गया।

हुई। परम वदनीय माँ की चरण पादुकाएँ विभिन्न स्थानों पर
मनाई। चेतना यात्रा का समापन यमनिका पार्क (पंचकुला) में
हुआ, उस दिन श्री सिंपल राजा और डा राजेश द्वारा भजन

प्रस्तुत किए गए। श्री सिंपल जी द्वारा गाए गए भजन "किवें हरियाणा में सहजयोग जुड़ा। हर जगह यात्रा की अच्छी
मुखड़े तो नजारा हटावाँ" गाने पर सारा माहौल चैतन्य की प्रतिक्रिया देखी गई। लोगों नें सहजयोगियों के सभ्य ढंग की
वर्षा महसूस कर रहा था। सभी सहजयोगी श्रीमाताजी के प्रशंसा की। सभी समाचार पत्रों व केबल टी.वी. ने इस यात्रा

हर स्थान पर सहजयोग के बारे में यात्रा के साथ साथ ही
यात्रा का हरियाणा में प्रभाव
हजारी की तादाद में पचे बॉटे गए। इन सब कार्यों से
सहजयोगियों का हृदय बहुत प्रसन्न था। चेतना यात्रा ने सभी
जिनमें गुड़गाँव, फरीदाबाद, पंचकुला, अम्बाला, यमुनानगर, को सहजयोग का कार्य करने की प्रेरणा दी। चेतना यात्रा में
करनाल प्रमुख थे। चेतना यात्रा का प्रथम उद्देश्य लोगों की सहजयोगियों को कार्य करने के लिए नये मंच प्रदान किए।

अनुभव -
जब श्री माताजी हथनी कुण्ड (यमुनानगर) मरकहुए
हाथ की बनी हुई दो रोटी खाई। उसके बाद श्री मलिक
की धर्मपत्नी अपनी सास को घर ले जारही थी, तो श्री
खोपड़ी पिलपिली हो गई थी। सिर में कोई हडीनही
क्योंकि उनका सारा कैल्शियम खत्म हो गया था। वे
देख भी नहीं सकती थी और डॉक्टर ने उन्हे केवल ढो
माह का समय दिया था। उनकी इच्छा श्री माताजी को
लाहोरीरोटी खिलाने की हुई। उनका बेटा उन्हे वहाँ ले
ठाया, पर श्री माताजी उस समय नाश्ता कर चुके थे।
जब यह इच्छा श्री माताजी के सामने रखी गयी तो श्री
माताजी ने स्वीकृती दे दी और श्री माताजी ने उनके
उपस्थित सहजयोगियों ने बताया कि श्री माताजी यह
वही औरत है जिसने आपको रोटी खिलाने की हच्छा
रखी थी। (अथार्त् श्री माताजी के चित्त में वह औरत
आई)। एक सप्ताह के बाद उनका सिर कठोर हो गया।
जब उन्होंने डॉव्टर को दिखाया तो डॉक्टर की समझ
में कुछ नहीं आया। वह केवल इंतना ही कह पाया कि ये
विज्ञान से परे की बात है और वह औरत आज ८६ साल
की होगई है और निरंतरध्यान धारणाकरती है।
The dedication is very important part of the ascent, why? Because when you are
precariously placed, when there is immediate danger to your existence, at this time
when the whole world is standing at a precarious position where it is going to be
destroyed completely. It is very important that you cling on to things that is going to
save you, with complete might and complete faith. Like you are getting drenched in
ordinary water doesn't matter, but if you are sinking in the sea, as there is question of
this moment of existence and that moment of destruction, that time if a hand comes
forward to fetch you out, there is no time to think any more but cling on to it with all
your might, with all your faith.

RENDEZVOUS
Discussions with Sahaj Yogi Brother
When & how you got Realization amd when was
Q-1
seeking manifested?
And how were these overcome?
Sahajayogi Brother: Basically, in Sahaja Yoga for a true
seeker, difficulties and problems have lost their
meaning. The Divine system is so spontaneous and
self responding that such difficulties are mostly
taken care of, if one is duly surrendered and is able to
get into thoughtless meditation regularly. But in the
beginning the following difficulties were generally
experienced:
Sahajayogi Brother: It was with the Grace of Her
Holiness Shri Mataji that I was chosen to get
inducted into Sahaja Yoga during May/ June 1988 in
Kanpur. A French Sahaja Yogi & his wife raised my
Kundalini. During those days Iwas passing through
an extremely stressful phase of my life, since
suddenly I had to face too many shocking and
inevitable challenges in my personal life. Worst
being the misery of losing my wife when the two
children were only 9 & 14 years old and that too
when I had not fully come out of the set back of my
father's demise only a couple of months before.

Discipline
I do not want to put too much restriction on children in the name of discipline, in
the beginning, because children are themselves very disciplined. But discipline has
to be there. If you follow the practice of getting up in the moning time, slowly you
will find children cannot sleep after that time. All these good habits can be done. To
sleep earlier, to get up early, not to talk too much, not become also absolutely deaf
and dumb sort, not to talk rubbish, not to be frivolous, not to be sarcastic. All these
things can be watched very carefully.
Children must know how to behave themselves, they must know how to answer,
how much they must talk. Do not spoil them with presents. Give them presents at
the right time and tell them how they should behave. This is your duty to discipline
them. No child should be allowed to answer back.
Teach them to be respectful. If you do not teach them, they will be disrespectful to
other people. Sit down with them one hour and talk to them, not in the presence of
others.
If they break the toys and all that, tell them that "if you are breaking toys you are not
going to get them." Keep them properly, arrange them, let them organise. This is
how you train.
Another habit children must form is to get up early in the morning and wash. The
parents must get up in the morning. Give them bath, get them ready. Do not give tea
to children, but milk. Tea is not a good habit.
You have to tell your children, until they are sixteen years of age, everything that is good, righteous, how to
behave and how to live. Otherwise, they become vagabonds. "Oh, we can do whatever we want, what is
wrong?" You teach them what is wrong. Do not give them money, Let them do the work. You should never
pay for your children's work.
Do not run after the children all the time, because once they know they are dominating you, they will sit on
your heads. They should know where they stand with you. Gradually they will learn and behave. Either you
make them human beings or you make them devils. Itis in your hands.
Children should know that you love them. Do little things that show that you care. Express your love. The
only fear they have is that they will lose that love. Love must be expressed. This is the main thing that they
have to be given all the time. Address them like someone higher. Respect and love, that is the point, rather
than beating them. To give a lot of love is the first priority, then the discipline.
Children should not be allowed to form habits. They should not get used to too much comfort. They should
attend to others, bring things for others and always be busy with someone. We should not make the children
work too hard.
In India, the whole society trains the attention of the child by continually pointing the attention to the correct
things.
It is not wise to make the child agitated all the time and enter into a sort of competition. Let the child grow
normally.
