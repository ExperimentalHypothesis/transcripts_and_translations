[Above the head] on 4 inches see if there is a cool breeze or not.
[To the man who holds the mike] I get up.
Just watch Me, open your eyes and watch Me without thinking. Just you can see.
Here. Move it a little bit.

Now, please put your right hand towards Me and left hand, as you were doing it. But now, put your left hand towards Me, and with the right hand, you see.

Right hand. Let’s see here. If you are getting little higher- some people get it very high also.
Good.
It’s there. Yes.

Now, this right hand towards Me again. And see with the left hand, please.

Now don’t think. Just watch Me without thinking. You can do it now.

Some people will get hot coming out. Doesn’t matter. Let the heat go out.
Now, just raise both hands and ask a question: "Is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost? " Three times.
Now, see. There is nothing to be known nature is absolutely quiet, watching you, witnessing you. And you are feeling the cool breeze in the hands, from where? The whole thing is watching you silently.
May God bless you all.

[Applause]
