Brenda and Rupert, you were married when you first met.

Brenda: Yeah, but that experience is completely different. It was intertwined, but different. Let Rupert tell you the beginning.

Rupert: It was pure accident because I was trying to improve my martial arts. I was involved in the martial arts, and you're trying to achieve this state of moksha, the Japanese style. We weren't getting anywhere. A friend of mine had been to Mother's meetings, but he didn't tell me about it. He couldn't make Shri Mataji out, so he gave me this tape. He said, “See what you think of that,” so I’ve got your opinion.

So, I sat in the garden one August afternoon and put this tape on. It was so pure to me. I called Brenda out. I said, “Come and listen to this lady's voice. 100% pure.” I don't know why I was saying it, because what she was saying didn't make any sense to me. But I just knew that this lady had something. I felt something here, but nowhere else. I couldn't make any sense of it.

To cut a long story short, I went and phoned my friend up and said, “Where did you get this tape from?” He said, “Well, I've been going to Caxton Hall, and she goes there, but she's coming to my home. She’s going to do a meeting in the East End of London, and she's coming to my house before the meeting. So if you want to come over, you can meet her there.”

So me and Brenda, we go over to this place. He lived at 1 Cranbrook Road in Barking. As we turned into the street, there were all these strange people outside his house. It was a hot summer day, and they've all got scarves on. I thought, “This is a bit strange.” He had this big wooden Buddha, and they're taking it out and putting it in his garden. I said, “What are they doing to your Buddha, John?” He says, “It's got bhoots. So he's got to go into the garden.” I said, “What do you mean, it's got bhoots?” He said, “Well, they'll tell you.” So I said to this young fellow, “Are you cold, mate?” He said, “No, I’m protecting my Vishuddhi.” Well, I didn't know what he was talking about.

We had a general chat, and then we were in the garden talking to these people. One of my students was with me, who I used to teach, because we thought we were going to get this moksha to improve our martial art. Then someone called out, “Jai, Shri Mataji!” and Mother came into the room. Brenda had an experience before that, but as far as I was concerned, Mother came into the room, and we all followed her in as well.

She sat down like this, and this young Sahaja Yogini came along and went to her feet. As this girl, Cathy, went to her feet, we saw the Kundalini go up her back. Mother said, “Ah, do you see the Kundalini? Do you see the Kundalini?” It was a distinct, transparent snake. That's just what it looked like. We were all dumbfounded. I looked at Mother, and she said, “Yeah.”

In them days, there were skinheads, and they didn't like foreigners, if you like. They weren't going to have any coming into the house. But when we looked around, they'd both arrived. They'd come out of the garden, their boots were off, and no one told them to do this. But what we saw... no one could dispute what we'd seen.

My friend’s wife had just left him, and he had five children. Mother said to Brenda, to my wife, “Are these your children?” And she said, “No, no, they're not my children, Mother.” So she said, “Well, where are your children?” Brenda said, “They're at home.” Shri Mataji said, “Bring them to the meeting tonight.” So we shot home, got the kids, and went back that evening and sat in front of Mother.

All my lads were there as well. Mother was saying to each of them, “You're very right-sided.” By the time she got to me, I felt really guilty. I thought, well, these blokes, it's all my fault. When she sort of worked on me, it just felt like an ice cream cone above me. Then someone said, “Can you say the Lord's Prayer?” And I said, “Well, I don't know it.” So they said it for me. They said, “Can you feel the cool breeze?” And I could feel this happening. I thought, “It's a window open somewhere.” Mother said, “Can you feel the cool?” I said, “Yeah.” But it didn't make any sense to me. It felt very good, but it was all completely alien to me.

She went along to my oldest son. I'd just lost my brother, who had just died, and he was very fond of my oldest son. My son was still worried about him. And she said to my oldest son, “Ah, there's someone here protecting you. You lost someone recently.” He said, “It's my uncle, and I love him.” She said, “Well, you tell him you're okay now. You'll be fine. You let him go.” He said, “I'm not going to let him go.” But he did eventually. Then some yogis were going to work on the younger two children, and Mother said, “No, no, no, no, no. They're realized. Leave them, leave them.”

Brenda: But my experience was when Rupert was in the garden with his men. I was in the kitchen, leaning, sort of half listening inside and half listening outside. I didn't hear the house clear out of yogis, but the next voice I heard was, “Hello.” I turned around, and... well, I don't know how I restrained myself from dashing over and hugging her and kissing her. It was as if my heart did recognize, but the brain doesn't. And I thought, “What are you doing? Control yourself.” I walked up, and I took her hand, and I said, “I'm so glad you could come.” And she just hugged me. It was such a wonderful experience. You can only relate it to your earthly mother if you've not seen her for years, and suddenly you see her and you think, “Oh, Mum,” and you really want to go and run and hug and kiss them. Well, that's exactly how I felt. But, of course, your brain doesn't understand your heart, does it? Everything else that Rupert said is extremely accurate. It was fantastic.

Rupert: Yeah, it was absolutely. For years I couldn't comprehend what was going on. I didn't believe for about two years that these vibrations were coming from me. I kept saying, “There's a door open somewhere.” I couldn't comprehend that this was this cool breeze. And even when I did, it didn't make a lot of sense to me because I was brought up in a different culture. People would say, “This is Kundalini.” But I thought, “Well, okay, so what?” That was the attitude.

Were you meditating for these two years, though?

Rupert: Oh, yes. In fact, we had a fantastic experience. This was another thing. This was after I met Mother.
