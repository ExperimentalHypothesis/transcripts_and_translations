 Public Program. Perth (Australia), 3 March 1983.

Woman : … which is the point of evolution for all of us and it gives great pleasure to Sahaja Yogis to see so many other people coming along to get their Realisation. Because the experience, once you achieve it makes you collectively conscious and puts you in touch in a very real way with the vibrations of other people and with your own vibrations of course so that you are able to feel the exact condition of your subtle body, and your Spirit, and your chakras, which are these colored circles here (that) represent the subtle transformers of energy that are placed within us along our sympathetic nervous system. And in the center there, between the yellow and blue lines, the area in which the Kundalini energy rises when it's awaken by the presence of another being who already has that awakened within him. And [UNCLEAR] meeting the vibrations that are the same as the universal Kundalini energy.

Kundalini in Christian terms is called the Holy Spirit, and it’s the same energy that is described in the New Testament as a “cool wind”. In Indians Scriptures it is described as the “Chaitanya”, as “cool vibrations”, and in Muslim’s scripture it is called the “Ruh”, and also described as cool vibrations. And these cool vibrations that you feel once you receive the awakening, the vibrations of absolute Truth, once you develop this awareness, you are able to ask any absolute question. And by holding your hands out you can ask ; if you’re () you can ask the existence of God. And rather you get a cool or warm vibration you can tell whether what you are asking about is true or not true. You do need to rely of your intellect anymore to try to work out things, because that’s a limited sphere of activity. But actually, when you get your realisation, you go beyond mere thinking, into the unlimited, into the divine area.

I think it’s a relief to be with people who are seeking their Spirit, who do have the desire to know the Divine, and to understand those things that, in this society, have almost become [to boo/taboo] subjects. There is so much emphasis around this, upbringing on material success and competition, doing better than everybody else and achieving things, that the subtles things that are much more important get pushed completely into the background. And sometimes we feel, as if we quite at a step with everything because we know there’s an uneasy feeling that there is something wrong with the world at the moment, but we can’t put it right ourselves. And it’s quite distressing.

In my experience once I actually received my realisation from Mother two years ago, in Melbourne, at a program like this, I couldn't believe it. That it did actually … That I had found what I was looking for without even quite knowing what it was that I was looking for. And it’s because at first you try to understand with your intellect and it doesn’t seems to even make sense. A lot of people, their self esteem have been so damaged by their seeking that it’s hard to believe that you, yourself, can have this quality within you that is just waiting to be awaken.

So perhaps before Mataji arrives, it can be good if we can all sit quietly, and don’t try to do anything, if you’ve been in the habit of doing particular types of meditation or techniques, just try to put it aside and try to have a completely opened mind about this experience because it is different, although the terms may seems familiar to you from readings and teachings that you’ve had. It’s best to sort of try to approach it like a child with complete openness and freshness. There’s nothing frightening about the experience, because it is in fact a gift of God to us, and God is compassion and love. And the vibrations that you feel when the Kundalini is awakened are those vibrations that come from that Being. And there is nothing to be afraid of although some books do say that Kundalini awakening can be dangerous and so on, the people who have written that have experienced something quite different. But the actual experience should give you peace and joy which is absolute.

So if you can just try, just be at peace now and quite and then (633) the frame of mind and enjoy the experience when Mother comes. Thank you.

A man (to Shri mataji)

Shri Mataji (to the man)

The man (to the audience) : Again ladies and gentlemen, it gives me a great pleasure especially to the [The man stops as Shri Mataji receive a bouquet]

Shri Mataji : Thank you very much.

The man : Especially for the people who come for the first time, there are many who couldn’t come either last evening or today to the workshop, to all of you, welcome. Shri Mataji is here, for the first time in Perth to grant Self Realisation, not just on a one-to-one basis but to as many people as desired from their heart. Many got it last night, some came to the workshop today and experienced something more. All of you have to get it because this is the time where the grace of God is overflowing and all of the true seekers of ages have to get Self Realisation. It’s the reward of their seeking, it’s the blessing of their past births and all the seeking of God over the ages.

We’ve all probably been a christian, we’ve all been a jew, we’ve all been a muslim. We’ve been worshippers of God the Father and God the Mother, at many, many, times in history. And so now the times has come where we can get that final step in our evolution which is just to be triggered by an enlightened being. And once you get it you can develop to that point when you become totally one with God.

This is the real yoga. Yoga as you know means “union”, “oneness with God”. It’s not exercises it’s not discipline, it’s the actualisation of Self Realisation. And so, without further introduction by me, it gives me again a great pleasure, ladies and gentlemen, to introduce to you Her Holiness Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi.

Shri Mataji : To all the seekers of Truth and Joy I bow. It was really nice this morning to meet some earnest seekers come down to the place where I live and to get their ultimate : what they are seeking. We have to know that God has created us with a purpose. He has worked for so many years, He hamade us human beings with such care and love, there has to be a purpose behind it. We also know that we have not yet found our purpose and that’s why we are seeking. If we understand that, then one must know that something has to happen. God has to save His creation, and His greatest creation is a human being. So this what he has done with all the creation that He tried to evolve, and that’s how human beings are created.
The only thing was a human being was given freedom to choose between the right and the wrong for life. It so happened that human being in their error, naiveness, I should say, and ignorance, did lots of mistakes. Doesn’t matter, even if they have done, they have come to right conclusion. And that right conclusion as I told you yesterday sums up like this : that ‘whatever is going to happen to us, further than this, it has to be spontaneous. It’s a living process that made us human being nothing dead--- living process that has to work it out, that it has to be spontaneous, we can not work it out. Secondly, that you can not pay for it, or you can not maneuver it. And thirdly that you can not put in any effort, it has to be effortless. If it is has to be the most [UNCLEAR 1210], is has to be effortless.

So that’s how we reach certain conclusions, that Self-Realisation, if it is epitome of our evolution, it has to be absolutely freely given, and has to happen in a very spontaneous way.

Yesterday I explained to you in short all the various type of ideas people have about Self-Realisation, and what we have to expect about Self-Realisation. We had another enquiry this morning about Kundalini, that gentleman asked me a question saying that he read a book saying that Kundalini business is very difficult,it comes upto a point and also not beyond a point and all sorts of stories.

I have to tell you that that’s not true. Kundalini is your own Mother. You have your individual Mother. And She is waiting all the time all these years just to give you your second birth. She never harms you, She never troubles you, She doesn’t do anything of that kind …. I don’t know the people who do not know how to do the thing or who have no authority, must be doing all these kind of tricks, and must be suffering from Kundalini awakening.

I know of one gentleman, who in Kashmir said that he’s got Kundalini awakening and he had tremendous eat and he had tremendous burning and all sort of things. And that it’s a very dangerous thing. He has written a book on that, sort of a ... I’m forgetting the name of the book. Now this gentleman himself is leading a very horrible life ; of that, I’ve been able to find out. He had all sort of relation, he is leading a sort of ridiculous life, not suitable for any saint. If such a man has to have Kundalini awakening, I can’t understand how can Kundalini come to him but, must be some sort of God’s anger on him that he has felt some kind of feeling within Him maybe. Or maybe he has been to somebody who is a wrong type of a person who has awakened the Kundalini without any authority and maybe that time the first Deity as I told you … (To Sahaja Yogis) Is it there ? The chart is not there. Ha here. (To the audience) The first Deity as I told you, did not like it and got angry and the whole sympathetic nervous system on the left hand side and on the right hand side got angry. And when that happen the person may develop lots of heat and lots of blisters, I have seen a person getting a blisters all over all around his neck.

At the very outset I must tell you that heat is the sign of violent action. Say for example if you heat the helium gas, the molecules of the helium gas start going all round, they are very volatile. They start moving in a way that you feel that two armies are fighting, then you find that en armies are fighting then you find that all of them are fighting with each other. But if you cool it down, their action is very collective, they move in a smooth manner in a very collective manner.
So one can see that when we are heated up also, you see a man is very hot tempered. (Which) Means he is a very angry person, and he can not carry on with others, he has no patience. But when a person is cool, he is collected, we say ‘he is a nice person’.

In the same way if you feel heat from your Kundalini, then be sure that something is wrong that is resisting you. Even while giving Realisation in the beginning you do feel little heat because the heat of the body has to go out. But today I’m going to tell you particularly more about the chakras and not about the general things that I told you last time. In any case you can get the book, and come to our centers and clarify it more and more. But as much as possible today I will try to tell you about the chakras : how we spoil them, and what are the effect of these subtle chakras which look after our gross plexuses within our body.

17:30 Please be sitted.

Now the first chakra as I told you is called as the Mooladhara chakra. [Microphone arrangement 17:45] Now this i the first center which is a subtle center within us. And this plexus is manifesting about in as your called the pelvic plexus. The pelvic plexus is responsible for all our excretions. Whether you like it or not it is there, it is present within us and it looks after our excretory functions. It is important to see that this chakra is placed under the Kundalini. So when the kundalini rises ; the Kundalini is the power within you, the pure power of desire : the desire that you want to become one with the Divine.

It lies below. This chakra lies below, it’s a very important point, that this chakra does not play any part in the ascent of the Kundalini because Kundalini doesn’t pierce through it. On the contrary if this chakra is pure, the information about somebody that wants to raise your Kundalini can be easily communicated through this this chakra but it does not play any part in our evolution. That means sex does not play play part in our evolution. Animal know what sex is, human beings know what sex is. Sex is a part very natural within us and for our ascent, the sex does not play any part. At the time when the Kundalini rises ; the Kundalini who is the Mother of the deity in this center, this Kundalini is the Virgin. So He is looking after the protocol of the Virgin. And this Kundalini when She has to rises, if you have by any chance () with this chakra, then it takes time for Kundalini to rises because this center has to give permission, or you say the sanction that it’s alright then the Kundalini can rises. This is the sustaining force, or it’s the center of the Kundalini itself.

Now the word Mooladhara means ‘the one who is the support of … ’ (to Herself) ‘Moola’ is … ‘Moola’ is … (to the audience) ‘… of the root’. The root is the Kundalini and it resides is that area which is called as Mooladhara while the center is down. And the center is called as ‘Mooladhara Chakra’. that’s how you have these two things separated. Now it is important, because it is the sustenance, it looks after the protocol of your Kundalini. So anybody who says that you can ascend through sex, please be sure you are mislead by that. I do not want to mislead you, I want you to have your Self Realisation because you are people who are seekers, not today, you’ve been seekers of ages. And no use running after something because it appeals you on weaknesses or because it supports some sort of a thing which you heard before like Freud.

What Freud has said is absolutely wrong. Because what he has achieved today, you can see clearly that all the societies in the west are finished. This is thank to the unholy trinity, and one of them is mister Freud. When I said this in Austria people were very happy because they were feeling guilty for this Freu whom they supported always and what he has done : he’s played a mess with everybody’s live, he just knew one side of life. Which start from the sex and goes up. That’s only the desire. That’s only the desire power but he didn't know the other side. When he talked that you should not be conditioned at all, he did not know that if you did not conditioned yourself, then there is another side which is much more dangerous, and that is the side of ego.

This is what exactly Hitler did. He used his ego, and with this ego like so many such people who are taking ‘there is nothing like conditioning,what’s wrong, what’s wrong ?’ and what they achieved is nothing but a very bumptious,, useless ego which can not see the Truth. Anybody who (2254) that ego, they run after it. They say this is your name - big name they give you - or just do this, you look like this, you wear this ; you get quite satisfied with this. You have to be honest, if you are not honest to it, how will you get your Realisation. You have to be honest to get your Realisation, you have to be a human being first and last. if you are not a human being you are just trying to do something which is so outside. If you are doing something outside, you can not get it inside, you has to happen inside.

I feel concerned because you people are realised person if you take to reality but if you don’t take to it, what's going to happen to you ? Because you are seekers, you are not like mundane ordinary people, who are not seeking, who are just seeking money or possession or thing. You are special people, you are people of God who have to become prophets, and you must have powers to make others prophets as William Blake has said about hundreds years back. You are that type of people, and you should not waste your energy believe in things which is not true. Because you see the Kundalini is placed above that point which we call as sex.

We are not sex points to reduce ourselves to sex points is the minimum ; I mean the more degrading things that can happen to human beings. We are the highest type of creation God. Sex, everybody has, even earthworms have, any sort of nonsense ahs sex. What so Great about sex ? There is so much we talk about sex as if we are impotent people. There is nothing is sex that can give you your Realisation. Of course, you have to lead a sanity ... (Shri Mataji correct Herself) You have to understand a life of sanity and lead a life of understanding about sex.

Sahaja Yoga is never against sex, we believe in sensible marriages, bringing up children who are really realised souls to be born on this Earth, that is the thing that we have to achieve. So many great people who want to be born. But the people who are going to give them birth are
lost into nonsensical things,they are just lost. They have no idea as to the whole, what () what role they have to play into it, Just they get lost into their individual understanding of a thing. It is not that, you have. You have to understand it’s a very cosmic thing that’s happening, and thousands and thousands and thousands of people have to get their Realisation, that’s the main thing. If you don’t get your Realisation, I must say all the [] of desire of yours is lost forever. So don’t fix your mind into something that somebody has screwed into your head because thousands are running after it. Maybe that reality can not have thousands, maybe… Millions we can’t have, I know that. Reality is not easy to accept. Never people accepted reality so far.

When Christ came in, how they behaved, when Buddha came in, how they behaved ? Nobody does that way. You see, it’s like a horde that’s walking towards it, it’s not a shoal of fishes walking towards it, it’s not a big mob walking towards it, it’s every person that has to receive the Realisation. And you have to pay full attention to it. You have to respect yourself and know that you are a seeker and as a seeker you all must get your Realisation otherwise you have no meaning no purpose nothing. And if you join any purpose let pursue I would say : I’ve told with all earnestness and with all my love. But if you don’t want to understand it, nobody can force you Realisation. So please understand that first thing is to get your Realisation. If you can’t get your Realisation, then you have lost the biggest chance of your life.

You all have to become your Spirit, your Self, and this (Shri Mataji shows the subtle system chart) is the great instrument God have placed within you. And it is the greatest knowledge of the roots. Of the roots within us. And this knowledge, you have to understand first of all, you need not accepted it, but you should not deny. With opened mind, listen to me as what happens and how these chakras are within us and how they react and how we falter. 2730

So one of the first things I have to tell you that sex plays no part in Kundalini ascent as far as its piercing is concerned, it means it doesn’t have to pass through that. Whatever is the Truth I have to tell you. You may not like it but I have to tell you. I am not here to seek votes or to have elections or to collect money out of you, I don’t want to buy Rolls Royces, nothing of the kind. I just here to give you what you have, what is your own. I am just here to give you that : what is your own, what your own property. So it does not matter also if you don’t like it for the time being, but ultimately you’ll like because you will know Mother has told us the Truth.

Now the Swadisthana chakra, the second chakra within us, is also very important. This Swadisthana chakra plays a very very important part in our lives (when) in the modern times specially. Because this is the center we use for planning, thinking, for all our futuristic life. As well as doing all sort of physical work. This center is the one that crete balances as well as imbalances. If you use this center in the wrong way you create an imbalance within you, of a very very serious nature. This center for example, Swadhisthana looks after your aortic plexus in the gross. Aortic plexus doctors know what it is, but this center is placed in the … longeta, inside the spinal cord.

Now with this center we think about the future, or we can think about the past, we put in physical work also with this center. So it move to the right as well as to the left, it is dangling in the air, it’s the only center which moves on both the sides in such a big periphery, all round and it can also retract and can go further within. Now when we have an imbalance in this, we really do not realise that we are leading an imbalanced life ‘til we get into a serious trouble.

This center has got to look after your liver, your kidney, your spleen, your pancreas, and your uterus. Plus it has a very important work that, when you think too much, the brain’s cells are used up, to replace the brain’s cells from the fat cells from the stomach, it transforms the fat cells for the use of the brain. And this is a very important work it has to do. - (to a yogi on stage) Can you put on this one please ? - Now when this chakra works more for thinking or planning this, that, it neglects its other work which is also equally important like liver, and your pancreas, and your kidneys, your spleen. And thus we develop diseases of liver, of all these organs.

All of this liver troubles come to us because of its overactivity, also it can come to us because of inactivity of the liver. It can come to us from both the types of liver. Now if you have an active liver, a very active liver, you develop a funny diseases called biliousness : your attention is always unhappy and you feel like vomiting all the time you are irritable and you have a temperament that you don’t feel the peace within yourself. This is that, that means your attention is absolutely disturbed because the liver it the one that really sustain your attention. So when your liver is out, your attention is funny you don’t know what to do with your attention and all the time it’s terrible and you feel very nervous and agitated and anxious. And then, doctors do not know at this stage I think, it’s liver which is bad. So what they do is to use something to find out about liver, what’s wrong with the liver but when they try to do that, it’s not so easy to find out, till you find the patient is lying just at the deathbed with a sirose and then they certify “Now you are going to die”. But in Sahaja Yoga, if you have a liver (problem), at the very outset, you can make it out, that you have liver (problem) because as you know on the fingers, it can be felt where the liver is, and if you see that if this center of Swadhisthana chakra is catching (Shri Mataji shows the right hand thumb) with this center of Nabhi chakra (She shows her middle finger) then it means you have bad liver. And this liver is a very serious thing because it makes a personality absolutely useless for any communication after sometimes.

Another thing is the neglect of other center , let say your spleen. This a very serious thing because if you are very hectic by temperament, and if you are all the time thinking of future ”I have to go, “I have to attend the office”, “I have to do this, I have to do that” (at) that time, this center, as we call it the ‘left Nabhi center’, gets excited. And it hasn’t got, we should say, it has got that ‘attention’ that it requires, so it becomes very hectic itself. It goes into an emergency. All the time attending to an emergency, it is producing more and more red blood corpses and you become absolutely hectic. For example first thing in the morning people read the newspaper. First shock comes to them from the newspapers : “Somebody died”, “Something happened”, “Some horrible things happened” ; naturally the poor spleen goes into action and it starts producing red blood corpses. (At) That you start having your breakfast for example, so also additional emergency, then you are suddenly rushing out. On the way you see lots of this traffic and you have to catch up with the time and all that. All this modern life makes you that hectic, nervous, hasty we can say and a speedy person.

This spleen ; actually the speedometer is your spleen, so poor spleen goes into a bizarre state. It can not control your speed, and it tries to keep the speed with you, your hectic nature and it becomes hectic itself. And then a disease which we call as leukemia, blood cancer can develop. Blood cancer is the result of this kind of temperament and nature.

There are many children who get blood cancer. I’ve seen many children suffering from blood cancer. And these children get it from those parents who are like this, ‘hectic ways’, who are anxious “we must go to the office”, “we must do this”, “We must get that” ; so many things at the same time. Such people get this trouble called leukemia and (which) is absolutely curable through Sahaja Yoga. It is absolutely curable through Sahaja Yoga. It’s not difficult to cure leukemia, but you have to continue with the practice of Sahaja Yoga so that you absolutely get cured, and that you can cure the leukemia of other people.

Another thing that can happen to you is the kidney trouble. You see the kidney becomes overactive. The activity in the kidney too much create a problem within us which we call as hypertension. By which we get high blood pressures and things like that. People always say “I suffer from high blood pressure.” Doctor Warren himself when he came to Me, was a patient of high blood pressure and many other problems. But after Sahaja Yoga you settle down, you find you strike the balance.

You strike the balance because you don’t think so much. The thinking that goes on like mad stops. If you want to think you can think. If you don’t want to think, you don’t think, you can stop it and sleep, but if you want to think, you can think. When I met a doctor, in Geneva he said : “Cut my throat, do want you like, but stop this thinking”. You see it’s so disgusting for some people, because even if I don’t what to think this brain goes on “chuk chuk chuk chuk” like that troubling me so much. But it is because of this center which has got out of its balance, and it doesn’t know how to control, and that’s why these things happen. Then also women who think too much can become (...) They may not produce any children. It’s possible that they can become barren women because there is no nourishment to that uterus and maybe they can develop troubles of the uterus. All this troubles come from this over thinking, futuristic attitude, speediness in life. One of them is diabetes

Now diabetes will not occur to any ordinary farmer who doesn’t think so much. But it will always happen to a man who is thinking about a big plan, of how to project himself, his business plan or his other plans, all such people get diabetes. The reason is he think so much that there is no attention left to that poor pancreas, the pancreas gets seek, and that’s how we get this disease of diabetes which supposed to be incurable, not by Sahaja Yoga. In sahaja Yoga, diabetes is absolutely curable. Jaundice and all these diseases of the liver are also absolutely curable in Sahaja Yoga.

By giving the balance to the people you can achieve a lot, because this is what all the prophets told us : that we should lead a life of moderation, not to go to extremes. If you go to extremes, then you are not dharmic, (which) means you are not sustaining yourself properly. These are ten valences within us, in the human beings. In the carbon, there are four valences as you know. In every element there are eight valances, and these valences become ten valences in the human beings. Now these are the ten dharmas as they call it, or the ten kind of sustenance or ten kind of behaviour we have got to look after. If you do not keep that balance of these ten things, then we go off the balance. Like Buddha has told you that “you have to keep to the central path of ascent” that what exactly it is, that we have to keep to the central path of ascent if we can not keep to the central path of ascent then we suffer from, first of all, the physical problems.
First of all we suffer from the physical problems then we suffer also from mental problem because we go into an imbalance. Now when this chakra moves to the left side, we get into mental problems. Because when it goes to the left side what happens is that we start using things [like] for our emotional behaviour and emotional expressions and to much of it. As a result of that, what happens to us (is) that we become possessed by another force that resides beyond this center. And beyond this center resides the collective subconscious.

This collective subconscious is a very dangerous area where people should not enter. Any person who says “I’m very devoted, I’m very dedicated, I must do this” without getting connection with the God, if you do all these things, your whole attention can be ruined. For example supposing there is a telephone and you are not connected and you are using the telephone very fast then what will happen is that the telephone will go out of order, and you will have no connection. In the same way who earnestly try to do something without having connection with God, move to the left side which is called as the collective subconscious area. And this is a very dangerous area within us. From there many things, which the doctors call as ‘protein 58’, but we call them as dead souls, are attacking. Doctors call it as protein 58 because they don’t know what they are. They this protein comes from areas which are unknown but existed within us since the day of creation. That means it is collective subconscious. And these protein, 52 --- 58 they have tried to even photograph it and they that when they attack us, then only cancer is triggered. But the … of the cancer is created by our extreme behaviour.

How cancer is created, we should try to understand. For example the left side and the right side, as I told you there are two powers left and right side powers which we work out. For example the emotional on the left, and on the right hand side, we have a power which we call as ‘the power of action’ where your physical and your mental efforts are expressed. Now when we go to the extreme of these, then what happens the connection between the left and right breaks, just breaks. And when it breaks you start getting the power on its own, because it breaks the connection with the whole. So it is very arbitrary, it is not coordinated, it doesn’t cooperate with the whole body, it just starts growing by itself. And then one cell becomes big or a cell in the nose start becoming big and starts covering the whole face. There’s no relationship between the different organs and different parts of the face, it just starts growing, overpowering other cells, and that’s how we call it a malignant growth or a malignant cell. Now when you go on like that what happens : it breaks ; and the Deity, the One which controls it, the One which is inside it, just slips off. At that time, the best thing would bo to awaken that Deity. If you awaken the Deity, the whole thing comes back and that’s how we can cure the cancer of people. It’s true Sahaja Yoga can cure cancer ; I’ve been telling this for the last, I don’t know, the last twelve years or so : “It’s only through Sahaja Yoga, cancer will be cured”. Now we have many doctors that are doing cancer research and all that. We have one Dr. [Shrivardhar CHECK SPELLING - 42:30], who is doing a research now on cancer, and he has accepted this, it is only Sahaja Yoga (that) will cure cancer, otherwise nothing can cure it. Because when human beings go to the extreme to the right or to the left, they do this to themselves and they are vulnerable to be triggered by some sort of a protein, which enters into your being and triggers this cancer. That’s why doctors they can remove your ear, they can remove your nose, they can remove this, they can remove that but they can’t remove the base of cancer and the base of cancer is the center, the subtle center., And to attack that subtle center, one has to become a subtle person. Doctors have to become self realised so that they can attack

In Sahaja Yoga we have many Doctors. Some are russians, some are english, some are indians and they are all working it out together. Maybe that we may be able to publish a book on ‘How to cure cancer with Sahaja Yoga’ or ‘How we have cured cancer with Sahaja Yoga’. But the main thing is that we are not here to cure people, not to give cure to everyone every dicomentaria [SPELLING UNSURE 43:50] as we call it, but we are here to give you realisation. God’s interest is in people who are seeking God, who are God’s people, He’s not interested in devils. Supposing tomorrow, Hitler gets cancer, God won’t be interested in curing him. So God’s interest is in people who are seeking Him and those who get enlightenment, and after their enlightenment they can give light to others. God doesn’t bother about people who are just wasteful, who are good for nothing. He has to look after the people who really will take up the cause of God and do His work after getting cured.

Now we had a patient, today, this morning, who came to us, who went to some horrible guru, and paid a lot of money to get epilepsy and then a brain cancer. Now with Sahaja Yoga he is very much cure. He is walking about ; of course doctors had given up hope, that ‘prepare for his death’ in your Perth, we have got a case here. He’s now completely cured, he talks well, he walks well and everything is going on well with him, but for this, he had to come to Sahaja Yoga. God is not going to fall at your feet : ‘O, please listen to Me, you are very sick and you must get well, and this should happen’, God is not interested, you have to have to be interested in Him that is one thing, ‘You have to be interested’. (Lets) Say your prime minister, if you want to meet him, he’s not going to come and say ‘Alright, come and see me, I want to meet you, please come’. You have to [want him /UNSURE], he’s just a prime minister. But this (the One) I’m talking about is the prime minister of all the prime ministers, the highest of all. So you have to be interested about God, you have to get to Him, you have to ask for it otherwise, He’s not going to fall at your feet, that’s important to understand.

Now this center, which I’ve told you about (was) ”Swadhisthana”. Now the next center is the center of Nabhi. They have already explain to you what is Nabhi Chakra, but you should what diseases are called by a bad Nabhi Chakra. First it is on the left hand side and right and side. There are two types of people : left Nabhi and right Nabhi. The people who suffer from right Nabhi are the people who have got all the problems of the liver. There was a gentleman who was writing as thesis on alcohol. ‘What is the chemical reaction on liver when we take alcohol ?’. And through Sahaja Yoga only he realised what happened actually to this (liver). That water as you know is ‘H2O’, H ion are on both the sides and ‘O’ is here is bound by that (Shri Mataji joins Her hands before Her like a roof showing O at the top H on both sides) “H2O” : there are two ‘H’ and one ‘O’. Now when you start taking water, it (the molecule) keeps normal like that (Shri Mataji has Her hands joined in one line, the middle fingers touch each others) when the blood and the water comes in contact with the liver. The liver has the function to take away all the poison in the body as heat, it absorbs the heat and then transfers it as biles and it goes out of your system. But if you take (let’s) say alcohol and all these things in a very strong way, not in moderation and it’s too much, its ‘H’ (of the water molecule) goes down like this (Shri Mataji now shows Her hands like a high roof, the hand are close to one and other but only the fingertips are in contact) and when it goes near the liver, (the) liver can not suck in the heat, it can not suck in the heat. That’s how, the heat is accumulated, the liver goes on malfunctioning, and you’ll always have the trouble of the liver. Now supposing you in Sahaja Yoga, then the H starts moving like that (Shri Mataji turns Her hands in the opposite direction, all Her fingertips are pointed towards Herself) and all that is heat within you is passed into the liver.

You’ll be amazed when you will be doing Sahaja Yoga just now, we’ll be raising the Kundalini, in the beginning, lot of heat will be coming out of your head before you start feeling the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost. First, the heat from the liver will be pouring out, and you’ll feel very relieved when it’s poured out. And then you will start feeling the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost in your hands which is the all pervading power of God as I told you and first time after realisation, you can feel that cool breeze within you.

Now this chakra gets spoiled on the subtle when you are very money oriented. If you are very money oriented person, and you are always thinking about money, how to get money like mad, it’s a rat race for money then this center goes out. And when this center goes out, the person suffer from many troubles, not from money troubles maybe, but other troubles like he’s emotionally dried out, he becomes an unemotional person. He becomes a person who has no feeling for anyone. You must have heard about the Great [decoids UNSURE] in India, there is a lady, who was a [decoid / UNSURE], a small little lady of four feet height, and she was a person (who) was devoid of any emotions, she could kill anybody, she could do anything as long as she got the money. I mean the whole emotional side is completely blocked of such a person, who thinks too much of money all the time, and gradually he becomes very materialistic. And a person who is materialistic neglects his heart all the time, he neglects his emotions, his worried more about the carpets, more about this more about that than the emotions of the people than the feelings of the people. This kind of imbalance can come when your Nabhi chakra goes out of order and you start putting all your attention to money.

Now it’s more surprising the countries which are affluent have more money orientation than the people who are not. It’s very surprising. (Let’s) Say for example in an indian village, a person may not have so many things as you people have, but if you go to him, he’ll be very happy, whatever he has, he would like to serve you, his food, anything that he has. We would not like to see that you have not taken your food or your milk or something [UNCLEAR] He’ll feel so obliged that ‘you go and to serve you him’ with that joy and that love that he has. He would like to express his love. Now people misunderstand. I’ve seen people which are affluent misunderstand, they think it’s a slavishness, it is not. It is that they find joy in emotional life, in expressing their joy. To them it doesn’t matter, if he has to starve for the day, doesn’t matter. If he has given you food, He feel that’s his satisfaction ‘O God, he’s eating at my place, so sweet of him’. There is no slavishness, but it’s a kind of expression of that love. But in the west I found that people say that if you do that to somebody then people misunderstand, they think you are a weak person “That's a sign of your weakness”. I mean I was amazed, how can it be ?

I live in an area that is supposed to be [poor .../...] very very rich people live there, very rich people. Once it was snowing, snowing very heavily in that area. We were shifting that very same day so I went round, there is a square where we leave, so I went around the square, and I deposited some things. I saw a lady standing outside with a little baby in a pram, and (then) another lady had opened her door a little bit and talking to her there and the little baby was in the pram, and it was snowing. Can you imagine, and this lady was talking. I came back after half an hour and this lady was still talking like this she wouldn’t open the door. And they are extremely rich people. I can’t understand, how can a person with a little baby is in the pram. They hate children there. I’ve seen in that area, the people just hate their children, they beat them so badly. I’m amazed, they give them to the servants and the servants look after the children. In England you’ll be amazed that two children are killed by their parents every week. First I used to think it is England, but it is not so it only in London this is happening. Can you believe a thing like that ? I mean in India I can’t think of one woman doing that. So emotionally they are very strong people, but they lack (of) other things which you have which is to be combine with east and west has to be brought to a balance. It should be about “emotional life”, that you want to have more children and more children. That’s why more children are born in that country (India) : they like to have more children apart from that, they are the only people that look after their children so well, so all children want to be born there also. They would not like be born in those places where the mothers are very ‘hotty’ and angry for only a carpet being spoilt or something if the children [UNCLEAR]. Naturally they would like to be born with parents which natural, which are sweet to them, and that must be one of the reasons, why we are suffering from overpopulation. While in Germany it is minus, in London it is minus, you go to Norway, it is minus, (if) it is Sweden it is minus. On top of that people are committing suicides, they are competing among themselves : “Who is [UNCLEAR] ?”. For example if you go to … First I heard that it is Sweden where people were committing suicide more but now Switzerland has taken over and they have doubled to number of people that are committing suicides, I can’t understand. I heard about three girls from Cambridge, which came from Switzerland and they came to me and their vibration were like [of] dead people, absolutely numb. I was shocked, these young girls between let’s say sixteen or twenty, something like that : why should they not have that feeling of exuberance, that joy within them bubbling with life, such young girls. And I ask them ‘You come and see me in the house’, I mean I was really surprised. When they came to see me I asked them ‘What are you doing ?’ they say ‘Mother to tell you the truth we are just planning how to commit suicide’. Can you believe it ? It’s such a tragic thing ! Young girls just planning how to commit suicide but I said ‘WHY ? What is so much ?’ (they said) ‘Nobody gives us love, nobody loves us’ there is no love. ‘We’ve got money, we’ve got everything, we are daughters of rich families, but there is no love, and that’s how we want to commit suicide.’ Just imagine. This is what is happening when one goes too much into materialism. Matter can never give us joy, take it from Me. It is also an economic science that the material things can not give you satisfaction in general. They can give you a particular thing then you buy now you buy this, alright then you want to buy that, then you want to buy something else. But in general they are not satiable, that means “matter can not give joy”. … I do not say that you can not use the matter. You can use the matter for your purpose also when you know how to give it to others. That the joy of matter is in giving. Perhaps we have missed the point, but after Sahaja Yoga you will know that the joy of matter is only felt when you see the beauty of matter and when you see what it is to give to others. To give to others. It’s not for yourself that you can’t ever enjoy but only by giving (to) others, you enjoy the matter.

Alright, that’s going to a very subtle point, but that is what happens to you. That you become extremely generous, and as a result of that you enjoy the bliss and happiness and your own generosity within yourself. I’m supposed to be extremely generous and sometimes Sahaja Yogis are quite worried about Me that by the time I return I’ll be finishing with all my saris and nothing will be left out of that, they are telling Me all the time ‘Mother be careful, You are extremely generous’. But I enjoy My generosity, I do not enjoy these possessions so called (more) than My generosity because if have a possession it’s a headache, you have to go to the insurance, you have to worry that if you should be kept alright. It’s better to give it to somebody else and seen on other people than to have your own. If you own it, it’s a headache to you but if you give it to others it’s nice. You enjoy it alright, you enjoy this hall very well without owning it, if you have to own it, it would have been a headache for you to go up there (Shri Mataji looks at the roof of the hall) and look after everything, isn’t ? It’s better not to own it, let others have the headache, and let’s have the enjoyment. That’s what is the policy in Sahaja Yoga (which) you try adopt.

So now we have another center which is very important, it’s the center of ‘heart’, “center heart” we called it. It’s the center of the Mother of the Universe. In sanskrit she is called as “Jagadamba”. She is the One who stays there and gives you the sense of security. She looks after the saints who are trying to go out of this green thing (Shri Mataji speaks about the Void around the Nabhi) we call it as the ‘ocean of illusions’. She protects them, She gives them all the help, all the guidance and tries to pull them out of the illusion, and this is the way She kills all the devils and the demons who are like fake gurus who try to put down the seekers into the illusion more. She the One who is the remover of illusions and this incarnates again and again on this earth to help the seekers to get out of the ‘ocean of illusion’. But when this center as in childhood, it starts pulsating first. The sternum bone creates lots of antibodies and these are actually the soldiers of the Mother, and they go and get distributed in the whole body. When you see something coming up on you, you get a fear, and you get a palpitation in here (at the chest level). The rhythm of these palpitations informs the antibodies to be alert, to fight the person who is trying to attack. And that’s why it is important to understand that this center builds up your sense of security. If this center is disturbed, your sense of security can be disturbed.

Now the disease of this center is mainly breast cancer. When a woman is insecure in her life, feels insecure, then she develops this trouble. When she is insecure as a mother, she gets this trouble of breast cancer. Now doctors won’t believe it, but I have cured many breast cancers and that can easily be cured by awakening this special power of the motherhood within you, you just become self confident, and the diseases, completely cured, eradicated, without going into any operation or anything like that.

There are two other centers you see (at the center heart level), the one on the right right is of your own Father, on the right is of your own Mother ; or we can say it of fatherhood and of motherhood. If you are having a bad father or if your father has been not nice to you, this center suffers. If this center suffers then you get the disease called asthma. Asthma can only be cured if you tell the person who is a Sahaja Yogi, about ‘your father, where the problem is, if the father has died, he suddenly died, if you are missing him, or if there is a problem with your own child’ anything like that : the quality of fatherhood is [UNCLEAR 59:17] by that. The left side is is the mother’s thing, if the mother is not being very kind to the child, the child can be erated and could be very volcanic and temperamental. Very temperamental he becomes. If he [had] not see his mother, or the mother has been a very unkind person then such a person can be absolutely insecure all the time and could be all the time demanding attention from others and would be very very aggressive on that point. So this is what it is, one has to understand, that these two centers within us are important.

After Sahaja Yoga, you start understanding your parents even if they have been very nasty to you, you try to forgive them and they also come round very well and good relations are established with parents. Because you are seekers, sometimes the parents don’t understand you : because they have no seeking, that’s the [age/H 1:00:14] which may not understand your seeking. But when they see this transformation coming into you, then you completely change, you are completely changed. I’ll give you an example of a swiss Sahaja Yogi who came to Me, he has written a very big book on Sahaja Yoga called ‘Advent’. This boy had a father who was leading a life away from the family, give a the mother, he used to have some sort of a relationship and he never had any good relations with his children. But when this boy came to Sahaja Yoga and his younger brother and his sister, he was amazed how they were transformed, their ideas were transformed, they were leading such a nice life, very sain life, and that they were looking after him also, and they were doing whatever is possible just to make him happy. And this amazed him, not like the other children who just like to all the time say sharp things to the father and all that. Now one of the Sahaja Yoginis met him in a hotel somewhere. And another person started speaking about Sahaja Yoga and he said “I wish I was born at a time where Sahaja Yoga had started because I would not have wasted my life like that”. So the parents start seeing that ’How my children are changing’ and then they take to it, your style of life, betterment of everything.

Now the last chakra, I can not tell you perhaps today, is the Vishuddhi Chakra, which you read in the book, because already there is (Shri Mataji probably means “it has been”) a lot of time, we have to have realisation. But this is very important chakra because this gives you collectivity. It’s the center by which we know the whole, “Akbar”. They say “Allah uh Akbar”. It’s the great primordial Being, and we are part and parcels of that, so you feel the collectivity within you through this center. Those who spoil this center ; you spoil it by mantras, you can spoil it by talking too much, you may spoil it by not talking at all and sorts of things, and this reflects in sixteen sub plexuses, aorthical sub plexuses which has got to look after you nose, eyes, throat, neck, the muscles of the eyes, and your forehead also. It’s a very important center within us which gives us collectivity.

The sixth center which here (Shri Mataji shows the middle of Her forehead) is the center of agnya chakra. Agnya Chakra is very important because at this center, Lord Jesus Christ came in. He is the embodiment of that innocence ‘Shri Ganesha’, He came on this earth incarnated and He came with a special purpose. He came with the purpose to cross through that point which was very much join together because when we have the desire too strong and to act on it too strong, these two forces combine together, in such a way that there is no gap in between. So He came to go through that gap, to go through that cross that’s why His crucifixion has a big message. He came through our awareness to go through that position which is very subtles because He was Himself the subtlest of subtle. He was the One who was the Omkara he was the One the was the “logos”, as you call it, the “vibrations” as you see, He was that. And because His body was also made of that, He could get he resurrection. So the christianity has the message of resurrection, and this is the time of resurrection. Because he is at the gate there (in the middle of the forehead), we have to pass through that gate. But when you pass through that gate what happens is that the Kundalini awakens Jesus Christ. When Jesus Christ is awakened both these institutions of ego and superego are sucked in. When they are sucked in, you find that this place in your head becomes opened out. When this place becomes opened out, you find that this Kundalini also starts pulsating, and afterwards you find Her coming out of your head and giving you a cool breeze, and that’s how you achieve your Self Realisation. So that’s how it happens.

And the seventh chakra I think, when you come to the program of these centers (hall to meditate) and all that, they’ll explain to you is (the) seventh chakra and how it is integrated of whole the six chakras, And the seventh one which the heart here (on top of the head), which is the Spirit. In the heart reside the Spirit and the nature of the Spirit, yesterday I tried to tell you in short. That’s what you have to be ‘Sat’, ‘Chit’, ‘Ananda’ : ‘Truth, Attention and Joy’. Your Attention gets enlighten, you get the absolute Truth and you become the Joy. This should happen to all of you. I hope in this short time I’ve been able to explain to you the subtle side of these chakras as well as of the gross. But the subject is so great, that you will be amazed that least from London they have done at least thousand tapes here, which you can listen to them on various aspects and dimensions of life and enjoy your realisation like the bird after coming out of the egg, enjoy all the dimensions of beauty and the glory. May God bless you.

If you have any questions please ask.

There is one more thing somebody who was curing, you see. Someone through so called spiritual hand, He’s not God’s hands. As I told you this is coming from the left or the right side, it’s not God’s help. Because if God’s power starts working in you, It transforms you also. If it does not transform you, you are just like a radio, the music … but if it is transforming you completely, then it is God’s work otherwise it is the work of those spirits who are just trying to play some tricks. They are busy bodies so they just try to help you but don’t go near them, they are horrid. They’ll remove one disease and you will have another one.

The Yogi on the scene : Any questions ?

Shri Mataji (to him) : You can stand there.

The Yogi : Any questions ?

A man from the audience :

Shri Mataji : He’s a realised soul, so I can hear him clearly. (To the man) It’s true. What you say is true also ; that the centers we have, as you see are seven centers, then we have moon and sun : nine centers, and they are three above us. They are called … I don’t know if I should confuse you, but they are called as Ardha Bindhu, Bindhu and Valaya. These are three centers above realisation. These you have to achieve in your Realisation later on. Now we have twelve of these, and these twelve things make for the gross body of a human being through astrology. But we have in India a method which is called as Krishna Murti Partathi where we can talk above the spiritual side of these centers. We have a very nice thing developed in India, very nice.

Now when these fake gurus came in, their birth days were taken into account, and immediately this astrology cast their horoscope and say that ‘they are all fake, they are rakshasas, they are this they are that’, and they change all of them, their birthdates and everything. It’s really remarkable how they change their birthdate first, and then they say “we don’t remember, this, that” and all sorts of things. But you should see, they have published a very authentic magazine which is dealing from () astrology, horoscope and all that. It’s amazing how they have predicted all the things perhaps and Perth, they’ve been saying that I’ll be touching Australia, australians would be the great Sahaja Yogis, surprising.

The Yogi : He also asked ‘Are there chakras on this Earth, and does Australia has a chakra ?’

Shri Mataji : It is ! Australia is the Mooladhara itself, it’s the biggest chakra that you could think of. (It) Is the Mooladhara itself, it’s the first chakra. If you see, Perth is all red everywhere, if you see it’s a … &gt; You have got in the center of Australia, Shri Ganesha sitting down. (To the yogi) What do you call that ?

The Yogi : Ayers Rock

Shri Mataji : Yes, And you can see his trunk also, red like that. It’s the Mooladhara itself, it’s one of the biggest centers in Sahaja Yoga.

The Yogi : And interestingly enough, it is exactly, the same longitude… sorry,latitude of the birthplace of Shri Mataji&gt; Precisely the same latitude of the birthplace as Shri Mataji in India. As it is one the tropic of Cancer, so it in the tropic of Capricorn.

Shri Mataji : Yes, Australia is very important from Sahaja Yoga point of view. Very important. You see your basic quality is Innocence imagine ! According to Sahaja Yoga, Australia stands for Innocence. (A woman wanted to ask a question) Just a minute, let Me finish. And this Innocence is your basic quality. According to Sahaja Yoga, Europe is the liver, and Lodon is the Heart. India is the Kundalini.

The woman from the audience , the yogi repeat the question to Shri Mataji : Can you give the translation of the Nabhi ?

Shri Mataji : Nabhi means ‘navel’, alright ? It’s ‘navel’. I went to Athens and they told me ‘This is the navel of the Universe’. I was telling them that Europe was the Navel. And there I went, they said in Delphi, they said ‘this mont represents the navel of the Earth’. So I tried to feel the vibrations, it was. But I turned down and say ‘Why these vibrations are coming ?’ and there it was Shri ganesha sitting there, like an elephant, a little elephant. So I asked the translator I said ‘What is this ?’, she said ‘a little elephant sitting down there’ can you imagine ? The Mother Earth has created it. This is all created through Mother Earth which is said in the Bible that ‘Thou shalt not produce or reproduce something that is created by the Mother Earth’. And what is that ? That we call as Swayambhu ‘the one which is created by Mother Earth’. And this is one of them, you have Shri Ganesha created in the center of Australia.

The woman from the audience , the yogi repeat the question to Shri Mataji : When you do Your Yoga concentration, as she calls it, do you concentrate on the Void as well as the Nabhi.

Shri Mataji : No, no not at all. Not to concentrate on your Nabhi or anywhere. Concentration part doesn’t take much part in Sahaja Yoga. First you allow your attention to be absolutely free, alright ? Then the Kundalini rises. She rises and comes out of your ‘Brahmarandra’ as we call it. In case your attention is very rumbly, we say that ‘pay attention here a little bit’ but there is no need at all, the Kundalini comes up and She’ll breaks through. You have to leave your attention a little loose, not to bother about it. But later on what happens supposing, you have a Nabhi problem as you were saying, in the Solar Plexus you have a problem. The Kundalini will go back and hit there, and your attention will be drawn automatically.

You don’t have to pay attention it, you’ll be drawn. Then by your attention you can raise the Kundalini. So you don't have to concentrate anywhere just like that. Like if you are driving, then you just have to concentrate on driving it self. But if you concentrate on any point you are finished. So you must know where you are and where you have to move. Before Realisation there is no question s of concentration, it just spoils you completely.

Another woman : Shri Mataji, is Realisation synonymous with ‘enlightenment’ ?

Shri Mataji : Yes of course.

The same woman : So ….

Shri Mataji : You see, it means you have to be enlightened. It also means ‘Atma Sakshatkar’, it also means to be the ‘Piir’ (twice born). In Lao Tse, he says ‘Tao’, you have to become “that”. That’s so many things. Everybody had says, it’s “that”. (To a man in the audience) Yes ?

The man : one occasion several years ago.

The yogi : He went up on the night of a full moon, he was absolutely frightened and shaking

(Shri Mataji asked) on Ganesha ? (The Yogi confims)

The man : It’s like being confronted by Eternity (the Yogi repeats to Shri Mataji)

Shri Mataji : My child you have been to all horrible gurus, you see. So naturally, Ganesh was trying to frighten you there. He frightens, not only that, He is the One who gives you these horrible experiences of heat, these blisters and He is the One who gets angry because He doesn’t like the way people are. You see, He is the One who gets upset. Kundalini is ther He looks after Her protocol but He can not understand why people are doing wrong things … because He is Wisdom, He is the embodiment of Wisdom and if you have done something unwise, He gets angry with you. (Shri Mataji laughs) that must be the reason. You have seen people come to Me (they) also shake on the beginning a little, but it doesn’t matter.

The Yogi : Any other questions ?

Shri Mataji (pointing at someone in the audience) : Are you alright now ? Good. Good now. (The person answers) It doesn’t matter it’s so good.

The Yogi (repeats the question of a woman from the audience to Shri Mataji) : Can she be healed, she had a stroke some years ago ?

Shri Mataji : Yes, of course.

The yogi to the woman : Have you got paralysis ? (the woman answers, then then Yogi to Shri Mataji) Partial paralysis.

Shri Mataji (to the woman) : That’s nothing, that can be healed no doubt.

The Yogi (repeats the question of another woman from the audience to Shri Mataji) : She can understand about the enlightenment, but she can not understand about the emanations probably she means Your powers.

Shri Mataji : You will understand that, alright ? Gradually. Everything you can’t understand in one days can you ? You will understand everything. You don’t worry about it, You just worry about yourself. I didn’t say anything about Myself, have I said ? I’ve never said anything. I’ve been very humble. I’ve never said anything, I dare not. Because it is not wise, I’ve learnt it. [UNCLEAR 1:18:04] who said it had a bad time. If you say something about yourself, suddenly the ego will just punch at you. It’s very bad. I’ve never said a word about Myself. So you don’t try to understand Me just now, first try to understand yourself alright ? Then you understand Me.

The Yogi : Any other questions otherwise we will have the experience of Self Realisation ? This is what Mother’s come for. Really, a lecture is not the important part, the experience of Self Realisation is it. We’ll swift the fans off and you’ll feel it for yourself. Any other questions ?

The Yogi (repeating a question to Shri Mataji) : If they are your devotees, do you look after them ?

Shri Mataji (laughing) : If I look after them ? Ask them, you’d better ask them, if I’ve looked after them or not ?

The Yogi : I think it’s obvious. Insofar, as all of us have been physically well, our nervous, mental, psychological problems have been healed. If we are endangered by an accident, if there is any particular problem which we want to solve within our own lives or within our relationship, we put that at the attention or our Almighty God, and by doing so, we find that it gets solved. We’ve got all sort of little methods by which work things out, we showed you some of them today. In working out how the chakra are cleared, you can learn all of these things at the center, there are certain aspect which you won’t fully understand unless you actually achieve the awakening of the Kundalini, but as you grow in it, you’ll understand how eventually the blessings of God actually descend upon you in a tremendous way. Your well being is cared for, your health is cared for, your psychological problems are solved. You become a complete and whole person and this is the very beautiful part. When this lady asked is enlightenment is synonymous with Self Realisation, the answer is “yes”, but it’s a growth process : you touch it, or maybe you go more than that it the beginning. And from that touching of self realisation, you grow from that point to a complete Realised Being. But you are an enlightened Being because you start this final journey in your spiritual evolution. We’ve had a human evolution this far, now we’ve reached our spiritual evolution. And the road is very very rapid now because in this lifetime, we can achieve the state of full Realisation. Just by these techniques. Very simple techniques that will be shown to you by the devotees of Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji : But I must confess one thing to you people. Your guru was very allergic to flowers and things. I’m very allergic to these dress, absolutely, because this is not your style. These are to be worn by people who lead an absolute celibate life, and it meant for people who are not householders. And another if you read … Valmiki in the Ramayana, I don;t know if people read that or not where Shri Sita said that a sanyasi has nothing to do with householders at all, if he’s a real sanyasi, he should stay out of the city, out of the village only for …and he used to be given one day [] and finished because you know what happened with Her, Ravana came with this dress, and that’s how I’m very allergic to this dress because it’s not true. It’s not true. Have you renounced to whole world ? You have not.

So not go into thing kind of a thing, you have to be normal people, you have to be living normally, accepting what you are. And not announcing something which you are not. You see, this is what the gurus do, they give you a dress and . So if you want to have Sahaja Yoga ; of course today I hope I’ll give Realisation ; but afterwards you give up all this nonsense, you become normal people. You have to be absolutely normal. Nothing abnormal about it, recluses, funny type, no. We have to get the whole world out of there to [] We can’t just do it for ourselves, individual some sort of a nonsense, no. We have to be responsible for the whole world. We have to be absolutely normal people, behaving in a normal way, not to get an abnormal way. Alright, so I am very allergic to these dress, I just tell you. I hope I give you Realisation, because you are seekers, I can see that. All of you you are seekers, you should get your realisation. But I’m absolutely allergic to this, because their gurus is allergic to flowers. Imagine, God is so fond of flowers, I can’t do without flowers. I can not understand how can any saintly man be allergic to flowers.

H.H. Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi
