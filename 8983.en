But you have to keep your mind open like a scientist to understand we have not yet found out the absolute truth. We live in a relative world and that's why we have problems. So many problems we face today, ecological problems are there, drug problems, sickness, this, that. And as if we feel there is a kind of a destructive force that is working and we are really bothered, some are frightened who understand the devastation that is possible.
The reason for all these problems is very simple and if we can just go into the scriptures of all the religions, there is one common point about them. The common thing, all of them have said in essence one thing, and they have said that you have to seek the eternal. Seek the eternal! Not take it for granted that you have got it. Seek the eternal and the transitory is to be used in its own limitations and understanding. Here we have gone wrong because we have worried too much about transitory things and nothing about the eternal. The transitory things are transitory because it has got the build in quality of getting destroyed. That's why they are transitory otherwise they would have been eternal. This build in quality in the transitory things brings in all kinds of problems. When we look at these problems we have to look back and see that by seeking eternal, how the solution can come. It's said in all religions that you have to be born again. That means they have indicated that we have to have a more - greater dimension, a more awakened state or a greater dimension of awareness. Not that to certify yourself as "we are born again". If you just want to certify yourself and want to live in ignorance and a blind following another blind, is not going to work out.
One has to accept that so far we have not found the absolute and that to find that absolute we have to actualize the second birth. Is not some sort of an artificial baptism that is going to work out: Our fathers were baptised and their fathers were baptised and we have been baptised and baptised and baptised. In every religion they have some sort of an artificial method of baptism, whether it's Hindu, Christian, Muslims, everybody has. But nobody has actualized and that actualization has to take place, for which the Creator must have created something great within us.
When we see the civilisation outside and then we realize that there is something wrong in it, we have to know that this outside growths is like a tree growing outward. But the roots must be nourished, we must know the roots. And this is the knowledge of the roots. Now you have to take it as a hypotheses whatever I am saying to you. Not to take it for granted. It's a hypotheses. If it works then in all your honesty you have to accept it.
It is being said by Jung, has said it clearly that you have to get your Self-realization by which you will have collective consciousness, a new dimension to your awareness. Or we say, we are all brothers, alright, every country is one country, God has created one world, they talk of United Nations and all that, but they are not. Let something happen and you will find all of them are hither and thither. Why? Why it happens this way that we cannot see that unity in people who talk about it? We cannot feel that peace about which they talk? They have got peace foundations and they have got all kinds of organisations, talking of big, big things, but we don't find that those who are running them have any peace within themselves. So with unreal things we cannot create reality.
Thus we have to realise that the time has come for us to take our second birth. If we want to have any meaning to our life, to our human life, we have to have our second birth. If we cannot have our second birth our life is a waste, it has no meaning. Now the second birth is - I would say that in India, in Sanskrit language we call a person who is twice born as "vijaha", is the born twice. And the one who is born again also is called "vijaha", Self-realized. A person who is born again is "vijaha". And also a bird is called as "vijaha", means the bird which is an egg first and it has a second birth and by that second birth he becomes the real bird. First the egg and then the bird. This kind of second birth has to actualize within us. You try anything else - lecturing, sermoning, doing all kinds of things that people do- is not going to work out. Because it's a living process of living energy of God. The living process works spontaneously, as like a seed, you have to just put it in the Mother Earth and it sprouts by itself. It sprouts - you can't say how, because the Mother Earth has got the potential and the seed has got the build in power. In the same way we all are build in to be that. Now Sahaja Yoga – “saha” means with,” ja” means with you is born - is the right to be united with the Divine Power which is all pervading.
Now when I talk of all pervading power of divine love people might say, Mother is talking something which we don't believe in. You believe in it or not - it is so. Now see these flowers, it's a miracle. We can't create even one! Who does this work? And the choice - the roses will have roses, jasmin will have jasmin, chrysanthemums will have chrysanthemums. Who does this choice? Done by this divine power which is very subtle and all pervading. Only after realization you can feel that power as cool breeze of the Holy Ghost because that power is the Holy Spirit. That power is the one which we call it in Sanskrit language as Brahmachaitanya. That power acts and works out all these wonderful things.
Now in our evolutionary process we have reached the human stage. We have to go little further to achieve it. It's a very easy thing to do, it can be easily done, takes hardly any time. And I have to say that no amount of arguments can bring forth this happening, it has to work out within yourself. As a result of that you yourself in that enlightenment know so many things and that in that enlightenment you know what is the Absolute and what is not. In a way we can say, you become a saint. A saint, who doesn't give up his family, his houses, anything. He lives as he has to live with his own status, with his own family life, with whatever it is. Supposing Christ was born in a rich family, He would have lived like a king, in complete detachment. And if He was born in a poor family, as He was born, He lived like a carpenter’s son. Because such a person has no attachment to things and is not bothered as to what is important to other people. What is the most important thing for such a person is the benevolence of others. He looks after the benevolence. And the benevolence is done not by money, by talking sweetly but actually through the power that He has of vibratory awareness. Such a person has such innocent eyes that even a glance of that eye can do wonders.
Now through your Kundalini awakening people have been cured definitely of cancer and of so many diseases. And in Delhi University for your information there are three doctors who have done their MD with the theses on three subjects: one with the physical abilities in Sahaja Yoga, second epilepsy cured by Kundalini awakening and third for psychosomatic diseases. Psychosomatic diseases means so many diseases which are supposed to be incurable like Parkinson, cancer, aids. And they have got their MDs. Now in America as you know there is a law that nobody can cure without the permission of your associations. But you don't do anything. Actually your Kundalini itself rises, it's your own power that rises! And you get just cured. And how you get cured that I'll be telling you tomorrow, how it works physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually, and how you become a different personality, a special personality, who is endowed with collective consciousness that you can feel the centres of another person and your own centres and that you can raise the Kundalini of another person. All these things can happen to you and you can become that powerful person as been described in the scriptures.
So today for the time being let us think of getting your realization. And tomorrow again I'll tell you how these diseases can be cured if we can get these centres enriched and nourished by Kundalini awakening. Talking about Sahaja Yoga and Kundalini is very easy and anybody can talk about it. But the main thing is to get your Self-realization. I must have spoken in various places and thousands of lectures I must have given. But that is of no avail because by lecturing you cannot get your realization. There is no end to this knowledge but as for opening these lights you have to just switch on one light, one switch, in the same way it's all build in within you, only thing - you have to get it and you have to feel this all pervading power. So now I think let's have the experience, will be the best idea. And if you have any questions you may write them and give it to us. Tomorrow I hope to answer all your questions.
So I hope you like to have your realization first. Is it all right? I think those people who are very much far away could come forward, would be better idea, this side. Today is a very good day with Father's Day and is also the day of our Creator. Anyone can come here just to show? All right. You'll have to show where to put hands and things like that. Is a very simple thing is that first you have to take out your shoes because Mother Earth helps us a lot to take out our problems. Now, it's a very simple method, you don't have to do much. But on the very outset there is one condition that you have not to feel guilty about anything whatsoever. Forget the past and please don't feel guilty. Please don't feel guilty. Forget the past. You have to be very pleasantly placed towards yourself because we have to enter into the Kingdom of God. And we should not condemn ourselves. After all we are human beings, we are not God. And if we have done any mistakes the Divine Love has power to dissolve everything. So please be pleasantly placed towards yourself. Not to feel guilty is very important. And it's a fashion also these days just to feel guilty for nothing at all. After all, if you have done something really serious we would be in jail, we would not have been here. So please do not judge yourself. Please do not judge yourself and have that respect for yourself.
Another request is that as we have to forget the past, we have to forgive everyone. That's something difficult I think. In the west I found, wherever I had programs, every time I had to attend to them to see that they forgive. But logically, what do we do? Wether we forgive or we don't forgive, we really don't do anything, do we? So why to go on pondering about something which bothers you? If you don't forgive then you play into wrong hands. So please try to forgive every one. Just forgive, just a lip-service call it. Just say, I forgive everyone. In your heart you have to say it. Please forgive. And don't remember whom you have to forgive. Just take out that from your mind completely. Let no such memory which makes you unhappy be there lingering. All right. These are the only two things we have to do as far as your own attitude is concerned. Now we have to know that it is all build in within us, it's all your own and it will work out on its own. So we don't have to put in much effort, only thing, I would like to tell you how we can raise our own Kundalini and how we have to release our own centres, which is a very simple method, even a child can do it.
So first of all we have to put the left hand towards Me like this, because left hand is symbolically suggesting that we desire to have our Self-realization. So just put your left hand towards Me - all of you please do it. Just put your left hand towards Me. And put both the feet on the ground separately because these are two powers, left and right power, which I will tell you tomorrow exactly what it is. Now, put your left hand just like this. And the right hand represents the action. So with the right hand we have to touch our different centres, just to release any blockade if there is. First thing will be to put your right hand on your heart. This I am showing you just now and then we'll have to close our eyes and do the same thing. So first is to put your hand on your heart. This is the centre where resides the Spirit. The Spirit - Atma. Now you have to put down your right hand in the upper portion of your stomach on the left hand side. We are working on the left hand side. So put it on the left hand side, your right hand. This is the centre of your mastery, mastery which is created by many prophets, by which you master the art of divine love, by which you become your own master. Then you have to take this hand in the lower part of the abdomen on the left hand side. And here is the centre of pure knowledge, pure knowledge that manifests through your central nervous system. It becomes your own knowledge as you can feel cold, hot you can feel the good and bad. Then again you have to take back your hand onto the upper portion of the abdomen, and then again to your heart. Then you have to take your right hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder and place it as much as possible towards the spinal cord. And turn your head to your right. This centre catches when we feel guilty. And which is a very dangerous thing because by this centre blocked we get horrible diseases like angina, spondylitis and all kinds of negative thoughts come into our mind. So please put your right hand on the corner of your neck and your shoulder and turn your head to your right. Now put your right hand on top of your forehead across and bend your head and press it on both the sides. This is the centre of forgiveness. Now, take your right hand and put it back on the backside of your head. And put your head on it to rest, take it upward. This is the centre where you have to ask for forgiveness without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes. Then you have to stretch your hand fully. Now stretch your hand please. The centre of your palm you have to put it on top of the soft bone which you had in your childhood, called as the fontanel bone area. Press it hard, push back your fingers, put down your head and move your scalp seven times clockwise, very slowly. That's all. Very slowly you have to move it. Seven times. That's all we have to do. Now please close your eyes. You can take out your spectacles. Be comfortable and don't open your eyes please 'till I tell you because your attention has to be sucked in. So please don't open your eyes. There will be no problem, there will be no funny happening as some people fear, is absolutely the smooth moving of the Kundalini 'till you will start feeling the cool breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area. And also you will start feeling this all pervading power of cool breeze. This is the beginning but later on we'll have to make this connection all right.
So please put your left hand towards Me and close your eyes and put the right hand on your heart. Here you have to say within your heart, or you have to ask Me a very fundamental question, you may call Me Shri Mataji or Mother, whatever suits you. Please ask the question three times, Mother, am I the Spirit? Please ask this question three times. Now if you are the Spirit, also you are your master, you are your guide.
So please take down your hand onto the upper portion of your abdomen and press it hard. Here again ask Me a question three times, Mother, am I my own master? Ask this question three times.
Now take down your hand in the lower portion of your abdomen, on the left hand side. Here is the centre of pure knowledge. But I cannot force on you. I respect your freedom. In your freedom and glory you have to ask for it. So please say, Mother, please give me pure knowledge. I want pure knowledge. You have to ask for it. Say it six times because this centre has got six petals. Now, when you say that, your Kundalini starts moving upwards and so we have to now open the higher centres.
So raise your hand, right hand, and put it in the upper part of the abdomen and press it hard. Now here we have to help to open this centre. So with full confidence you say ten times, with full confidence you have to say ten times, Mother, I am my own master. Please say it. Mother, I am my own master. Now raise your hand on your heart which is the most important centre because the Spirit resides in it. You are not this body, you are not this mind, you are not this intellect, you are not the conditioning, you are not your ego, but you are pure Spirit. So here you ask, twelve times you have to say it here, with full confidence twelve times, The greatest truth about yourself, Mother, I am the Spirit. Mother, I am the Spirit.
We have to know that the Divine is the ocean of love and compassion. It is the ocean of bliss and joy. But above all it is the ocean of forgiveness. So we cannot commit any mistakes which cannot be dissolved by this great ocean of forgiveness. So please raise your right hand in the corner of your shoulder and your neck and press it hard. Turn your head to the right. Here with full confidence please say sixteen times, sixteen times, Mother, I am not guilty. Please have confidence in yourself and say it, Mother I'm not guilty. All these ideas that you are a sinner, you are this, please forget it! That's all nonsense! You are a human being and you have to become a Self-realized personality. That's what it is. So please say sixteen times, Mother, I' not guilty at all.
As I have told you that whether we forgive or don't forgive, we do not do anything. It's just a myth. So we should forgive because if we don't forgive we play into wrong hands because of this myth. We think that we have not forgiven, how can we forgive, it is rather difficult. But there is nothing difficult about it. Now please raise your right hand onto your forehead across, place it across and bend it down and press it on both the sides. Here is the centre where you have to forgive. So please from your heart, please from your heart forgive everyone. Please from your heart, otherwise it doesn't work out, Realization doesn't work out, the Kundalini stops at this centre which is very important. Please, please forgive! Forgive everyone, I request you again and again, please forgive everyone, very important! That's the biggest blockade I think, I faced.
Now, take back your hand and put it on the backside of your head and push your head on it. Here now you have to say, O Divine if I have done any mistakes, please forgive! But you are not to feel guilty, you are not to count your mistakes. It's for your satisfaction. Just say, if I have done any mistakes, please forgive! From your heart, how many times is not the point.
Now stretch your hand please, put left hand towards Me. Stretch your hand and the centre of your palm please carefully put it on the fontanel bone area or the soft bone which you had in your childhood. The centre of your palm. Push back your fingers as much as you can. And now you have to move your scalp very slowly, very slowly clockwise, very slowly clockwise seven times. Here again I cannot force Self-realization. I cannot force that on you. So you have to say, Mother please give me my Self-realization. I cannot disrespect your freedom. So please say it seven times, moving your hand very slowly, pressing your scalp, moving your scalp, pressing back your fingers. Please do it carefully! (Shri Mataji blows into the micro).
Now please take down your hands and open your eyes. Just watch Me without thinking - you can do it! Just watch Me without thinking. Now put the right hand like this and bend your head and see for yourself if there is a cool breeze coming out of your head. Some people might feel a little heat coming out, it's all right because heat has to come out first. Now put your left hand towards Me, bend your head and see for yourself if there is a cool breeze coming out. It's already very much cooled down, but don't doubt it, just feel. Sometimes it comes quite ahead but try to put it next to your head but not on top, above it and then move further to see if there is a cool breeze coming out. Now put back your right hand please. And see for yourself again if there is a cool breeze coming out of. Don't get upset if it is not there, it will work out. Don't get upset, just watch!
Now push back, push back your hands like this towards the sky, push back your head. And here you ask a question three times, anyone of these questions: Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost? Mother, is this the all pervading power of Divine Love? Mother, is this the Brahmachaitanya? Ask this question three times. Anyone of them, just ask it three times. Now take down your hands please. Now see, there is no breeze around. The trees are silent, they are just watching us. But you'll feel the breeze in your hand and you must have felt the breeze out of your head also. Those who have felt cool breeze coming out of their head, the fontanel bone area or from your fingertips, will you please raise your both the hands? Please raise higher! O my God! Practically the whole of San Diego has felt it! Tremendous place! Thank you, thank you! May God bless you!
Now don't discuss about it because it is beyond thought. You are in thoughtless awareness. But tomorrow when you will come then we'll again see about it, as I would say, the connection has to be properly fixed. For that tomorrow you'll be here and I hope there will be a follow on program. One must know that you cannot pay for it. One must know that you cannot think about it. It just happens and is there. So enjoy this night and every night and every moment of your life! May God bless you! May God bless you all!
(Shri Mataji speaks to a Yogi.) What does he say? They should write it down, questions later, tomorrow morning, tomorrow when we come because today what I am saying that let them go home, tomorrow let them come and then we'll see about it. Today let them go.
So I would say tonight you can go home. Don't talk about it, just be in silence. This is the thing you have been seeking, which has happened, it has worked out but we have to understand each and every thing about it, the whole knowledge will be given to you. Absolutely you will know the whole thing. And tomorrow I'll be meeting you, people, I will give much more time, I will start much more earlier in a proper way. I hope you enjoy this new life which is starting now and the transformation that will take place, you'll be amazed at yourself! Complete transformation! Tomorrow we'll talk about it more. May God bless you all!
Now inform your friends and call them here and let them also receive this Self-realization. It is your own and you all should have it. You have a right to have it. So may God bless you all!
