霎哈嘉瑜伽公开讲座 

1990年11月5日 曼谷

我向所有真理的追求者致敬。开首之先,你们要知道,真理是如其所如的。你们不能将真理概念化,亦不能组织真理。同时以人类的知觉,你们不能感知真理。你们要成为更精微的存有。真相是:你们不是这个身体,不是这个思维,不是这个情绪,你们都是永恒的灵。另一个真相是,有一个无所不在的、上天浩爱的力量存在。所有经典都描述过这个力量,灵性上升进的目的,是要找到永恒的灵。你们要成为真我,除非你们成为真我,否则你们会感到某种空虚,你会觉得十分不安。

这个无所不在的力量,造就所有关乎生命的工作。看这些美丽的花朵,我们视之为理所当然。我们不会去想这些花朵,如何从一颗种子生长出来。我们内在也有一个系统,是能够生长起来的,使我们得到重生。这些你们不能用钱来买,就好像我们不能给钱大地之母,来偿付她给我们孕育的万物,我们不能用钱来买这一切。但人们忘记了,这些都是无价的。而且有许多假导师出来,招揽门徒,赚他们的钱。

所有宗教都是由那些降世的神祇和先知所开创的。但现在都变成人为的宗教,如果我们是聪明的话,便应知道那些人不能为我们做些甚么。所有这些先知和降世神祇,都是来自同一棵生命之树的,都是来自同一棵灵性之树的。只是人们摘下那些花朵,然后说这是他自己的,他们执着那些死去的花朵,互相斗争。因此那些先知和降世神祇并没有错,我们要看清楚每一样事物的本质,每一个宗教的本质都是追求永恒,知道物质界的有限。物质界是过渡性的,因此我们要明白这一点,才去利用物质。

现在到了人类这个时刻,有一点很重要,你们必须知道,就是有一个新时代已经开始了,这是个集体得到自觉的时代。我很抱歉很迟才来到曼谷,我想好像这是近来我最后才到访的国家。现在已经在56个国家有霎哈嘉瑜伽在发展,那些人不断在令其他人获得自觉,就好像只有已经点亮的蜡烛,才能燃点起另一支蜡烛一样。所以这时代真正算得上是全世界得到光明启发(enlightenment)的时代。这并非一种人为、虚假的信仰,这转化必须由你内在的真我自己去进行。

今天是第一天,我希望大家先向我发问。首先我要说明,今天我所讲的,你们不能盲目地相信。你必须像个科学家那样开放的思想,自己去判断这个假设。如果假设给证实,那么作为诚实的人,你就要接受它,因为那不只是为了你们的好处。正如这麦克风,若不是接上了总机,它就没有甚么意思,同样,若我们不是连接上了生命的大源,我们的生命就没有甚么意义了。

所以佛陀曾说,你要「皈依佛」「佛」的意思是觉醒、开悟(enlightenment),但那不是指一个思维概念,而是一个状态。另方面,他又说要皈依「法」,法(正法dharma),是存在于我们内里的,就像我们内在的十个原子价(valency)一样。你可以属于任何宗教,基督教、印度教、回教,却可以作出任何罪来。人类可以有任何种族,但都是一样的,因为他们都没有内在得到唤醒的「正法」。那就是要「皈依法」的意思了。佛陀又说要「皈依僧」,「僧」的意思就是「集体」,当你得到自觉之后,你就成为了整体的一部分。这不是一个证书,你可以藉中央神经系统,从指掌上感应得到。亦可感到你自己,和他人的能量中心状况。若你懂得怎样去纠正那些能量中心,你就可以医治自己和其他人了。你就可以在精神、肉身的医治上面,去帮助别人了。但最重要的,却是在为他人流露出灵性的喜乐。

明天我会讲述灵体的性质,和潜伏在三角骨,或叫圣骨内的灵量(Kundalini)。但今天我希望你们问一些合适的问题。

问:Sahaja Yoga(霎哈嘉瑜伽)这名词怎解?

答:霎哈嘉(Sahaja)的意思是与生俱来,你是与生俱来有这权利去达至瑜伽(Yoga)。瑜伽的意思是「与上天的力量合一」。简单地说,Sahaja的意思是「自然而然」,即如生命过程一样。

问:可否用两天就学会这技术?

答:不必多久,不必多久。「觉醒」(awakening)不必多久,但你要完全巩固自己,有些人只用上几天,有些人约一个月就可做到。但你不必付钱,你却必须对生命有价值观。而且,你是不能被勉强的。你必须通过自由意志去渴求。

问:你说的enlightenment(觉醒)是甚么意思?

答:觉醒的意思是你能用中央神经系统,去感应一切过去进化的成就。就即如狗可走入污秽地方,人就艰难了。原因是进化过程使我们达到有感觉污秽的能力。但得到醒觉后,处于心里面,本来只是作静观的灵(spirit),就开始启发你的注意力。我告诉过你们,在你们的中央神经系统,你是可以感应他人,和自己的能量中心的状况的。而且你知道绝对的真理,因为你可以感应到这凉风,任何事情你去问,都有「是」、「否」的答案,像部计算机。假如有个男人装扮成赛峇峇(Sai Baba),又说自己是圣人,我们怎去判别他是真是伪呢?假如你找来十个已是得自觉的灵的小孩,蒙上他们的眼睛,他们可以立刻回答出,他是真还是假导师。如果一个人在黑暗之中,手里拿着一条蛇。你告诉他是蛇,他未必会相信,直至给蛇咬为止。但即使那里只有少许光,他也会把蛇抛掉。我见过有霎哈嘉瑜伽练习者,一夜之间戒除毒瘾和恶习。那时,你知道绝对真理,你了解自己和他人,你的注意力变得十分纯洁。纯洁得连一个眼神,都能创造奇迹。眼神内亦再没有贪婪,你变成一个圣人。你过普通人的生活,你变得极为有活力,但你亦十分有爱心。要描述下去就要讲一堂课,所以最好先自己去亲身经验这个无所不在的力量。还有其他问题吗?

That's good. I think if you all sit on one side, it will be a better idea. All of you. One should not feel...I think that people are a little upset because of a few people, but one should not be upset because, in the beginning, it's always so. 
 See there is no end to knowledge and I must have given thousands and thousands of lectures only in the English language. But when you come to this hall, I had just to tell you that you put on the one switch and all light is coming. But it is all built-in within you; the system is all built-in just like as if this is built-in. So if I go on telling about the history of electricity, how it came to Bangkok, it is quite boring. Best thing would be to get the experience. Now, there are three conditions for our ascent. First one is that you have to forget the past and not to feel guilty at all. People might have told you that it's a sin and all those things that you are sinners, so don't believe that. After all, you are human beings. You are not gods. You are the only ones who can make mistakes. So please, do not feel guilty. Now if you feel guilty then the centre here, on the left-hand side, catches very badly. It's a very dangerous thing also because it gives you diseases like angina and all the diseases which are caused by lethargic organs. Moreover, spondylitis is another disease you can get with this feeling guilty.
 The second condition is that you have to forgive everyone in general. Most of the people say it is very difficult to forgive; but whether you forgive or you don't forgive, you don't do anything. But if you do not forgive, then you torture yourself and play into the wrong hands. That means you live with a myth. So, in general, you have to forgive, it means don't think of each and every person, just say I forgive everyone. You feel much lighter immediately. 
 Then the third condition is that you all have to be extremely self-confident. You are not to doubt yourself. You are all capable of getting Self-realization. So, please don't be diffident, don't count your mistakes. Now you feel guilty and forgive everyone in general. This will help us a lot to raise the Kundalini. If you do not forgive then the centre on the optic chiasma is like this, very tight and it won't open; it has to open out like that; otherwise, the Kundalini won't rise. So, all your life you tortured yourself, now at least at this time you should forgive everyone. I mean to say you should be very pleasantly placed towards yourself. Because you do not know what Glory awaits you. You will only know your meaning and your greatness once you get your Self-realization. 

All right, now very simple things we have to do; [Yogi's name/UNCLEAR], can you come here, please? You can show them, come along. Now, he will show you how we are going to nourish our centres ourselves. 

First, you see that, and then we will have to close our eyes; it will take hardly 10 minutes altogether. I'd be happy if you could take out your shoes because this mother Earth helps us a lot. And both the feet have to be apart from each other because these are two powers which work within us. Please, keep the shoes behind, it would be better. Now, please put both your feet away from each other. Left side is the power of Desire; the right side is the power of Action. So you please put your left hand like this on your lap very comfortably. You have to sit comfortably, not bending too much or bending backwards, but you are comfortable. The left hand towards me like this suggests that it is your desire to have Self-realization; it's symbolic. The right hand we will use for nourishing our centres on the left-hand side. All right; so now -he will show you also, you can have a look- put your right hand on your heart. On your heart. Here resides the Spirit; but the seed of the Spirit is in the fontanel bone area which was a soft bone in our childhood. Then we take our right hand on the upper portion of our abdomen, on the left-hand side. This is the centre of your master. This is created by great incarnations of great masters, like prophets. Now, this right hand you have to take it in the low portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side and press it hard. This is the centre of pure knowledge. Pure knowledge is that which manifests on your central nervous system. This is what Buddha is. From where the word Buddha has come. That means it is not mental, but you feel it on the central nervous system; also from Vidyâ, Vidyâ is meaning the same thing. Now, raise your right hand again on the upper portion of your abdomen and press it hard with your fingers. Again, raise your hand on your heart. Now raise your hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder. And turn your head to your right, fully. I've already told you that this centre is in jeopardy when you feel guilty. Please do not feel guilty about anything. Now put your right hand on your forehead across and now put down your head. This is the centre where you have to ask for forgiveness, you have to forgive everyone. Forgive everyone in general. Now you have to take your hand back on the back side of your head and push back your head. Here you have to ask forgiveness from the all-pervading power, without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes. Now the last centre, which is important: stretch your hand palm fully, bend your head down and put the centre of your palm exactly on the fontanel bone area which was a soft bone in your childhood. Now press it hard, push back your fingers; important is to push back your fingers so there's good pressure. Good pressure on your scalp; now please move your scalp slowly seven times clockwise, slowly seven times clockwise. That's all we have to do. There's one thing you have to bend your head, that's better. Then you can pressurize it better. And don't move the hand, move the scalp, please. All right, that's very simple now. 

Now, we close our eyes; you may take out your spectacles. If there's something tight on your neck or on your waist, you can loosen it a little bit. Close your eyes please; keep both the feet away from each other and left hand towards me. Now please put your right hand on your heart; nowhere you have to ask a question to me. You may call me Sri Mataji or Mother, whatever you like. Now ask a very fundamental question: "Mother, am I the Spirit?". Ask this question three times. Please ask this question three times. Now if you are the Spirit, you are your guide, you are your master. So now please take down your hand on the left-hand side in the upper portion of your abdomen. And here you ask a question again three times: "Mother, am I my own master?". Ask this question three times. I have already told you that I respect your freedom and as you have to attain the complete freedom, I have to respect your freedom. So I cannot force pure knowledge on you. You have to ask for it. So now please put your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side. Here, you asked six times because this centre has six petals: "Mother, please give me pure knowledge". Say it six times. As you start asking for pure knowledge, this Kundalini starts rising. So we have to nourish the upper centres with our self-confidence. So please now raise your right hand onto the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side. And here you have to say with full confidence ten times: "Mother, I am my own master". I have already told you that the truth is that you are the Spirit. You are not your conditioning, your ego, but you are the pure Spirit. So now please raise your right hand on your heart and here with full confidence say twelve times: "Mother, I am the Spirit". This all-pervading power is the ocean of knowledge. It is the ocean of compassion and bliss. It is the ocean of Joy. But above all, it is the ocean of forgiveness and whatever mistakes you commit, this ocean of forgiveness is very powerful and he can dissolve all of them. Now raise your right hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder. And now put your head towards the right, fully. Here you have to say again with full confidence, 16 times: "Mother, I am not guilty at all". I have already told you that whether you forgive or don't forgive, you don't do anything. It is a myth that we do not forgive and as a result, we torture ourselves and play into wrong hands. So now please raise your right hand on your forehead across; and please fully put down your head. Here you have to say from your heart, not how many times: "Mother, I forgive everyone in general". Please send your head, please bend it. I forgive everyone in general, please is very important. Say from your heart. Now please take your right hand on the back side of your head and hold it tight. Push back your head as far as possible. Here, without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, just for your satisfaction, you have to say from your heart again, not how many times: "O Divine power, if I have done any mistakes knowingly or unknowingly, please forgive me". Please put your hand on the back side of your head, push back your head. Now, the last centre; now stretch your palm, put the centre of your palm on top of your fontanel bone. Now again I cannot cross over your freedom. I respect it and I cannot force Self-realization on you; you have to ask for it. So now press your scalp fully and move it seven times slowly saying "Mother, please give me Self-realization". Bend your head. Move your skull clockwise with full pressure.

Now take down your hands please; please put both your hands towards me like that and watch me without thinking; now put your right hand like this and bend your head and see with the left hand if there's a cool breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area. Now don't put your hand on top of your head, please; away from it, some people get much further. You might get also a hot breeze, it doesn't matter because you are not forgiven. Now please put your left hand towards me and now bend again your head and see for yourself if there's a cool breeze coming out of...now do not doubt...maybe hot breeze. Now please put your right hand towards me; again bend your head and see for yourself again if there's a cool breeze coming up. Now raise both your hands towards the sky like this and fully bend back and ask a question three times: Mother, is this the power of God's Love? Other: is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost; Mother, is this the Paramachaitanya? Now please bring down your hands, please. All those who have felt the cool breeze or hot breeze out of your head or on your fingertips and hands, please raise both your hands; both your hands, please. It's good. May God bless you. You all felt it? Then, good. 

Tomorrow again those who have not felt it will feel it tomorrow and I'll meet all of you individually. Also, you can telephone to your friends and ask them to come. Isn't it? And or maybe they are feeling guilty? So tomorrow it will work out. I am sure it will. Thank you very much. Hope to see you tomorrow with all your friends, and I hope to be here very early. And I'll explain to you everything. (The white skin doesn't get it). There, they all got it. Good, we hope to see you tomorrow again and get more friends. Now you should not discuss around you because this is beyond mind. You can't think about it. If you start thinking you lose again the vibrations. So thank you very much. It's a very good beginning. 

Yogini: You will give us course?

Sri Mataji: Yes.

Yogini: When?

Sri Mataji: Tomorrow. We'll be having a follow-on here later on. Tomorrow, I'll tell you all about this, everything, and then they will have a follow-on. I will tell you everything. All right, tomorrow; and also we are having here some people who are staying over there come all the way from Switzerland and they want to have a follow-on program.

Yogini: [UNCLEAR] We are very late.

Sri Mataji: What happened is that today there was some sort of flooding on the way and for this, we were stuck at the airport. Do you come from what part of India?

Yogini: I live here for 20 years. I'm Jaïn. 

Sri Mataji: Jaïn is the thing I'm teaching you. What Parshwanath has done, you see. Jaïn is to know.

Yogini: Yes, I know.

Sri Mataji: So now this is what it is you have to have, all right? All right; May God bless you. I'm very happy. 

A yogini, leading another yogini to Sri Mataji: She has a problem in the back.
