Yeah, it was fantastic. For years I couldn't comprehend what was going on. I didn't believe for about two years that these vibrations were coming from me. I kept saying, "There's a door open somewhere." I couldn't comprehend that this was called a cool breeze. And even when I did, it didn't make a lot of sense to me because I was brought up in a different culture. People would say this is Kundalini, but I thought, "Well, okay, so what?" That was my attitude.

You were meditating for these two years, though?

Oh, yes. In fact, we had a fantastic experience. Another thing... this wasn't through me to my mother, but it was after I met my Mother. I was still sort of taking it a bit tongue-in-cheek, and one of these Sahaja yogis was working on me. I seen him stretch over and pick up this rose, and I thought, "He's going to ask to put that in my mouth in a minute." This was my attitude. I thought, "Well, here we go."

And he said, "Put it in the palm of my hand." As he put it in the palm of my hand, the top of my head blew off. I never felt this ever again. My head, it felt completely open. I could feel myself giggling down here, and I felt fantastic. It was unbelievable. You can't put it into words. It was fantastic.
