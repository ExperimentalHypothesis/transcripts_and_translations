Christmas Puja. Ganapatipule (Maharashtra, India), 25 December 1998.

First, I'll speak in English and then in Hindi.
Today, long time back, Christ was born. You all know the story of His birth, and of all the sufferings He had to go through. He’s the One who has given us the model of Sahaja Yoga. For He didn’t live for Himself, in no way, but He lived for others, working out the Agnya Chakra.
You may be Divine, you may be very powerful, but this world is so cruel that they don’t understand spirituality, they don’t understand the spiritual greatness. Not only that, but they are many factors which attack spirituality, they have always done it. Every saint has suffered a lot, but I think Christ has suffered the most. As you know, He was endowed with all the powers of Shri Ganesh, as He is the reincarnation of Shri Ganesha.
The first of them was His innocence: He was the eternal child, we should say that He could not understand the cruelty and the hypocrisy of this stupid world. Still if you can understand, what can you do about it? But with great courage, He took birth in a country where people had no idea of spirituality.
I read a book about Him, saying that He came to Kashmir, where He met one of My forefathers Shalivana. It’s very interesting, because it is all in Sanskrit, and the writer perhaps did not know Sanskrit, so he has given everything in Sanskrit language, which is not very congenial, I am sure, to the Western people. Thank God, he did not know Sanskrit, otherwise it would have been very dangerous. It’s written in that, that he asked Christ: “Why have You come to India?” So He said: “This is My country, that’s why I’ve come here, where people respect spirituality. But I live among people who do not understand spirituality at all.” His conversation with Him was very, very interesting, because Shalivana said that: “There is more reason that You should go back to Your country and teach them Nirmala Tattwa.” That’s the principle of purification. He went back, after three and a half years, He was crucified.
I personally think the big difference between the Western execution and Indian is that in the West, killing is a very great profession. With the slightest pretext they kill people. Anybody who is a saint was killed or they called him a madcap. That’s the best way to avoid spirituality. While in India, if a saint says anything, then he is not challenged, never! But they believe in it, because he is a saint, he is a much higher personality than we are. Though they were very nasty people around and they tortured them, but as a whole, the public, the people, respected them.
If they are false gurus, normally they don’t stay in this country, because they know they'll be found out. Also they are so money-oriented [Shri Mataji laughts delicatly] that they go to America or to some foreign countries and settle down there to make money.

This is one of the signs, one should say. This may be one of the reasons why Christ was born in a very, very ordinary family. He had no proper bed to sleep as a child also. It’s all described: where He slept, how His mother and father lived in a place where there were cows and calves. It was to show that spirituality does not need any luxury, doesn’t need any pompous show. It is a power within. It is a glow and a light within which shows, automatically. You do not have to do anything to show it out. Such a person does not have any sense of money and other things as positions.
He was bothered about people who were suffering physically, even the lepers, and He tried to cure them, He tried to help so many people who were sick physically. Because at that time, there were no hospitals, no doctors, so His attention was drawn to people who were suffering physically. Also mentally, He tried to prepare them: there are so many beautiful sermons on the mountain. In a way, that time, people were not so materialistic, so they listened to Him. We can’t say how many understoodHim.
17:02'
It’s very important that if you are not a realised soul, then it is difficult to understand spirituality. The one is talking about spirituality and the one who is listening to his, both of them must have minimum of realisation.
So from His beautiful life that I see, we have to learn that, unless and until we are realised souls, we will be torturing the Spirit of Christ. We have seen it’s happening: “All those who talk of Christ”, He has said it very clearly, “they will be calling Me “Christ, Christ!” I won’t recognise you.” Very clearly, He has said it, I don’t know why they didn’t remove it from the Bible.
It means those who will talk and preach and dress up to show off that they are spiritual in the name of Christ, He will not recognise them. It’s as simple as that! And this time now, when it’s the Last Judgement, He is going to judge the whole world on the basis of spirituality, which means vibrations. His Judgement has already started. I’ve seen it, you can see, in so many countries, things are just disappearing, all their ego, all their aggressiveness, all their cruelty are being challenged. And those who did wrong in the war also are taken to task. So in the history also, those who have done wrong to any community, to any people, they all will be taken to task. They had no business to be aggressive on people and to torture them. This is what is Shri Ganesha’s principle acting through Sahaja Yoga. Christ didn’t say that, but He did say: “There will be Last Judgement.” On one side, He was very kind and compassionate, on the other side, He was really Shri Ganesha, because He took a hunter to hit the people who were selling things in the temple. You cannot have business in the name of religion. What a big thing it is to understand. But the Christians didn’t follow that, they did not! I don’t know where have they gone. As we have Mahatma Gandhi who talked of spirituality and nothing else. “Adhyatma” [related to the Self, the Spirit] all the time. But his successors who came, put him somewhere with his spirituality and started a new world, new ideas, and a new style of life. Those who are supposed to be his followers are now wanting to have many pubs, and also all kinds of things, can you imagine? This Congress was started by Mahatma Gandhi, and the Congress followers are doing all this. Where are they going to lead? The beauty of this country is, the treasure of this country is spirituality. Instead of taking to spirituality, where are they going? They may not be Christians, but they respect Christ, they respect Bible. I must tell you it’s a fact people don’t know. They are not Christians, means in the sense, they are not baptised, but they respect, because they understand that there was so much of spirituality about Christ. He was the personification of spirituality. That’s the beauty ofIndians, that somebody is a Hindu or is a Muslim makes no difference. There were many Muslims who were Saints and Sufis in India, they are all respected by everyone, whether they are Muslims or Hindus.
So for Christ, nobody has any objection at all. On the contrary, you saw yesterday how they were all happy about it, because they are realised souls. But even if they are not, in this country, Christ is very much respected. They can’t understand: How can they scrutinise the life of Christ? How can they judge Him and how can they make vulgar films about it? This, they can’t bear it, because the respect that they have for spirituality exists very much more than it exists outside. Because in the name of Christ, people have done such a lot of wrong. Such a lot of killing has been done, all kinds of wrong things have been accepted. With all this, one does not understand how they have judged Christ.
For example, what I know, in England I saw, I was shocked that if somebody dies, they drink; if somebody’s born, they drink. Drinking is the only way they have relationships. [Shri Mataji laughts delicately] “How can you drink?” I asked them. He said: “Why? Christ created wine.” “When?” “In a wedding.” I said: “In a wedding? That was not wine, that was just the juice of the grapes that they grew there.” We call it “drakshas” [made out of grapes] in our language. How can that be wine? It has to be first fermented, it has to be rotten, how can that be?"
So this is the biggest Dharma: to drink! But in India, we know, though nobody has said anything against drinking, but we know drinking is a sinful thing. You see it every day: everybody knows that if you drink, you become absolutely out of your mind. That's not a thing to be said on a religious platform, but everybody knows that what this drinking is. Not that people abroad don't know, they also know. But somehow it has become a fashion. Even in our country, it has been now introduced. I don't know how, after Independence, people have started drinking. Every party, they drink. Also in the name of Christ, on Christmas Day. It's such an insult to His beautiful holy life. So when they came on this earth, perhaps all their powers of holiness were destroyed.

A very good thing about India, Indians say that at least they respect, they respect the holy places. That is something good about her. And they know what this holiness is. Now of course they are becoming very modern and Americanised, but still they know what is wrong, what should not be done.
With Sahaja Yoga now, I am very happy to say that the foreign Sahaja Yogis also have become very beautiful. I'm surprised, because in their cultures, there is no spirituality. But I don't know how they left all that nonsense and have come out like lotuses beautifully, with such beautiful fragrance of spirituality. This is something, a miracle. Everybody says: "Mother, we can't believe it, how could it have happened? How could You manage this?" I would say it's the blessing of Christ.
They saw how people are working out in the name of Christ in a very degraded manner, and they developed a kind of an awareness, that definitively something is wrong with it: this is not Christ, this is not His holy life they are depicting, it's something else. And that is how, I think, in the West there's a greater urge, a greater ascending force.

Yesterday somebody came and told Me: "Mother, there's no collective meditation." I was very happy to hear that. What is most important is meditation in Sahaja Yoga, no doubt about it. But the foreigners, they do meditation much more than Indians do, very surprising. And foreign men and women are very highly equipped, I must say, as far as spirituality is concerned.

Specially Russians, I was surprised that in America, they told Me: "Mother, these Americans are NOT Sahaja Yogis!" I said: "Why?" "They don't have that respect for You, they don't meditate. Those who do not meditate are not Sahaja Yogis." I said: "I agree." And they made all the Americans to meditate! I don't know why in this Eastern Block, people, Bulgaria and so on, Russians, Romanians, how they have taken to Sahaja Yoga so much. Of course, they had the curse of communism on them. Maybe that they felt that they had missed something in life and they went deep down into themselves. And that is how they have achieved it.
But I have to tell Indians that they have to meditate. Indians have one or two very bad qualities. And that is, one of them is "groupism". For example, if they are Bhramins, they will sit together; if they are this caste, they will sit together; if they are Bhanyas, they will sit together. If that is not so, then by another name, they will group together. This is the worse curse of My country, because once you start grouping together, you can never see the good of others and you can never see the bad of yourself. This grouping together can bring lots of problem in this country.

At the time of Christ, they had very different type of view: either they were interested in spirituality, or they were not. Now we have people here who are interested in spirituality, but still their one leg is in the water, where the age-old problems still exist. And this is the ruin of our country. We cannot combine together, we cannot be friends with each other. Of course not in Sahaja Yoga, I must say it has been solved very well.
But if you see, even at the time of Christ, He had problems with His disciples. Specially something happened with Peter and he is the one who said: "A Satan will meet you." Because I think people fall into the group of satanic forces. And He said that He removed the satanic devils from many people and put them in the pigs. It's true, there is a satanic force which is working very strongly. The more we develop security of spirituality, the more they will develop. The satanic force is in a different form in the West and in a different form in the East. But I would like to tell for them to be careful how to find out the satanic forces in the West. You may not be affected by that, because you are realised souls, but you'll have to fight it, you'll have to fight it.
For example, racialism: racialism is still very powerful there, very very powerful. And you have to fight racialism through marrying people who belong to other races. But still I find it difficult to marry a Black person to a White person. It's an impossible situation. If I try that, I don't know what happens. Once we had such a marriage, I must tell you, and a White lady, French lady, was married to a Black man. Instead of the French lady dominating, this Black man dominated. So I was quite surprised, you know, how could that be? So the reason was, I think he was taking the revenge, maybe the respite.

So first of all tremendous love and affection has to grow between the people. This colour is so skin-deep, it has nothing to do with the love inside, nothing! It's so skin-deep. Thanks God, in our country, you can have a wife who will be very dark, husband will be very fair or vice-versa. But they never look at that from that angle. I don't think that exists in this country.
But we have another kind: you see, just is a typical human problem is that he discriminates; through ego, which, I must say, Christ has tried to fight your ego. He was born in a very humble family. And He was not a white-skinned man, no! In your language, He was brown, but in Indian language, He was black.
But when it comes to spirituality, you just see the enlightened one, you don't see what colour they have the skin. It's very, very superficial, but this is one of the enemies of the Western life which, I think, must be conquered.
Materialism is another one, but the worst of all which is against Christ is immorality. Immorality is so much accepted in the West. All kinds of immoral behaviour is accepted. Like they say that, all these immoral people say: "Vote for somebody", he becomes the President of America. It's alright, does not matter. All kinds of immorality is allowed. But that is ABSOLUTELY against Christ, absolutely! People don't understand that immorality will lead them to a kingdom which I don't know what to call, because it's even worse than animal kingdom. And they are so immoral, they listen to people like Freud, as if they have no brains, they have no Spirit, to take note of such a man.

Only after Sahaja Yoga, the model of Christ life you can have. Whatever is past is over and finished. Today now you are realised souls and morality is your strength. Forget about the past and I'm sure you can get many more people under the banner of Sahaja Yoga if you lead a very, very moral life.
At the same time, another very bad enemy we have is our anger. So, they are very proud, they'll say: "I'll now get angry." "You know, I'm very angry." They are not ashamed about it. And they go on saying that: "I'm very angry", as if it's not wrong to say: "I'm very angry." Now they say: "I hate", I mean, imagine any Indian language they'd use this word, it would mean "I am committing sin".
So all this aggressiveness comes from anger. If somebody has to be angry, he should be angry with himself. Best is to get rid of anger: you can pull your hair, you can bite yourself, you can use your pillow to hit yourself! [laughs] That may be the best way to take out your anger.
But see for what you are angry: sometimes it's absolutely useless, sometimes it has no meaning, sometimes it's absolutely maddening stupid! But as long as you stop saying: "I am very angry", that's it, that's the time you should understand you are falling down completely.
So Christ didn't talk of all the subtle things I have been talking to you, because that was left to Me: without realisation, how can you talk about subtler things? You cannot!

Last time, I told you about the vibrations, what it is and what it stands for and how you get the subtle energy that we call as "Tanmatra", of our light, Tej, of water, Jal, and Vayu, Agni. But I didn't tell you of one, very special one which is in English language you call it Ether. But Ether is another energy which is managed by another Tanmatra, we call it Akash. Especially today, because it's Christ who has sacrificed His life to open our Agnya Chakra that we have reached that state of Akash. Without Him, it would not have been possible.
We can have general communication, like we can talk to people, we can say things, we can also use our fingers to express ourselves, our hands to communicate. But to communicate vibrations, you have to have vibrations. Otherwise you cannot feel another person. But if you are at the Agnya level, means you are mental, absolutely MENTAL, then your vibrations also are dwindling, in the sense you don't know really what they are saying. You can't judge your vibrations because these vibrations are mental. They say: "Mother, we asked the vibrations." I say: "Really? But you don't have any vibrations, how can you ask the vibrations?" Very common thing: "We asked the vibrations, we found from the vibrations". It's not possible, because you are just MENTAL. Now what Christ has done is to put you AWAY from the mental level, that is the most difficult. While I am surprised, those who follow Christianity have the WORST mental position, they are mentally absolutely there, I don't know how to call, like the fog of Delhi… [laughs] that you can't cross! That fog was broken by Christ. How much we should be obliged to Him, that He removed the greatest hurdle in the human ascent and that one was to break this Agnya, the mental being within us.
We read like mad, we listen to people like mad, we like those who give us food for our mental brain. They are so mental, so argumentative, think no end of their intelligence that you just have to say: “All right, Namaskar!” You can’t fight their mental attitude.

That’s why Christ is to be worshipped by people who are so very mental. And this mental nonsense has given such a sense of superiority to people –“Oh, whatever we do… What’s wrong? What’s wrong?” They cannot correct themselves, because, unless and until you cross this limit of mental being, you cannot see yourself. You cannot introspect, you cannot see yourself. You’ll see others: “These Sahaja Yogis are like this… Sahaja Yoga is like that…” –all kinds of things. But you can’t see yourself, because the whole thing is mental.
This mental attitude should be completely curbed through the help of our Lord Jesus Christ. But He is only mental –in your brains, Christ is also mental, now what to do? The one who broke the mental attitude is also mental –you have made Him into mental like a statue of stone.

So firstly we have to tell ourselves: “Now, don’t think, don’t think, don’t think, don’t think!” Four times. And then you can rise above it. And this is very important. In meditation, you have to go beyond the mind and, thanks to Christ, that He is sitting at the Agnya, to finish off this nonsense of mental being. I think people should stop reading also, perhaps, maybe. Even My lecture becomes mental, what to do? I mean, everything that goes into their head becomes mental, somehow, and then they ask Me questions: “Mother, did You say this way?” I said: “I said it to make you thoughtless, just to stun you. I didn’t say this to sit down and analyse and do… no, no. I said this, that you should become absolutely shocked and stunned.”
So, the best thing for all of you is to become thoughtless. That’s the blessing of Christ, that’s what He worked it out for and I am sure if you work it out, that don’t pay attention to others... Don’t react, just don’t react. Everything they will see, they will react. What is the need? What is the use? What are you going to do with that reaction? This reaction creates nothing but ripples of thoughts in your minds –I have told you hundreds of times and now you have to become absolutely thoughtless after this Puja.

If that happens, I think we have achieved a lot. That’s the biggest blessing that Christ has given you, which you should really enjoy. Then only this Akash Tattwa in you will work. And how it works? Through your attention. It works with Me, as you know.

With My attention, I work out many things. How? Just My attention has become thoughtless. Just thoughtless. It goes, wherever it goes, it works. But if you put your attention for thought all the time, for thinking, then it doesn’t do the work that it is supposed to do. Attention works marvellously, if you are thoughtless, otherwise it doesn’t. So it has to rise from your own self, then from others, to the higher level of humanity, where you are in communication with the sky, with we can call it as the “Tanmatra” or the essential or the essence of ether.
With ether, you can have television, you can have telephone, it’s a miracle otherwise. But with this Tanmatra, sitting down here, you can do the job, it works. Just attention works, I know that, you also know very well.
You don’t have to ask Me to put the attention, you just put attention and it will work. It is a very important thing that you have got. I think that is the first thing, once you have - no problem.
But we start manifesting from the Earth element. Then from the Agni element, then from the Jal element and then we come to Tejas, that the face starts shining. But lastly we get this thoughtless awareness by which our attention is absolutely free to do some special work.

But if you are all the time thinking, then, poor, this attention is so busy, you know, so very busy. You don’t have to ask Me then: “Mother, please pay attention”, you can pay attention and you can work it out.
In this attention, you don’t feel what you got, what you're standing, what you are wearing, what others are doing – no, nothing! You are one with yourself.

And it’s a life full of humour, so much humour, so much of joy, so much of happiness, that you don’t care for anything that normally people care for.

So, as it is now, Sahaja Yoga has worked in so many countries. I am so very proud of you, very proud of you. And now it is also going to African countries, it’s a very great satisfaction for Me. And you all can do it. You all can work it out. Only thing, become thoughtlessly aware, as the blessing of Christ. If it works, you will be absolutely enjoying yourself.
May God bless you!

Translation from Hindi:

The fact is that for the past thirty years this English language has been imposed on us.  I have never studied the English language. Never. Even in school there was a small book, and in college, Medical College, no one taught English as a language.  My father used to say – “It is such an easy language, and there are so few words in it that there is no need to study it.”  And he admitted us into a Marathi medium school. And he used to advise us – Learn Marathi and learn Sanskrit language. So I did not study Sanskrit language; and as for Hindi, I never ever studied Hindi language.

But there is one good quality in Me, which I must tell you about.  That whenever I spoke in Hindi, I spoke only Hindi; and when I spoke Marathi I spoke only in Marathi language, and when I spoke in English, I spoke only English.  It is very difficult for Me to translate from one to the other.  That is why I cannot mix up.  This language is different, that language is different, and the third language is different.  Now no one will believe that I have not studied Hindi language.  But because of My interest in reading good Hindi books, I learnt the Hindi language.  But in the beginning My Hindi had a lot of Sanskrit words and style in it.

Even Maharashtrians mix up a lot of Marathi words in their Hindi.  They don’t know the Hindi language very well.  When they speak Hindi, more than half of the words will be Marathi, and the rest will have a lot of Marathi in it.  You understand.  This is the condition.  What I have understood from all this is, that even language is a gift of God.  Like you have in music and the arts.  In the same way, aptitude for languages is also a God given gift.  And by that one can master many languages.

But the Hindi speaking people cannot learn any other language whatsoever.  The reason for this is, like the English for example, they cannot master any other language.  And even if they learn, they will not be fluent.  The reason is that every one can speak English, so there is no interest in learning any other language.  This is the situation.  Now the Hindi speaking people have this problem that they just cannot speak any other language.  I will never insist that you must learn Marathi, because Marathi language is very complicated.  Very difficult.  Only Maharashtrians can understand it.  And it has so much merriment and so many jokes.  There is nothing base or indecent in that language. There is not even a bit of filth or indecency in it.  It is such a profound and expressive language, that for Sahaja Yoga there is no other language that is more appropriate than Marathi.  Because it is only in Marathi language that a description of the Kundalini has been written.  Whatever has been written by saints and sages, have been written in Marathi language.  And if you learn Marathi, you can learn any other language.  There is no doubt in this.

But Maharashtrians will not learn any other language.  They are very obstinate.  I asked someone “Just read this book”.  He read a little bit, and put it down.  I asked “Why” and he said “It is full of rubbish and nonsense.  I don’t want to read it!”  Because Marathi is such a clean language with such pure thoughts, that after reading it one feels the same as after reading the Gita.  You cannot read wayside books of dirt and filth.  You will not be able to even look at it.

So if some of you start learning Marathi, it will be a good thing.  But it is a very difficult language to master.  There is a lot of synonymy in the language.  The reason I am telling you this today, is that even after coming to Maharashtra I am having to speak in Hindi.  Because you do not understand Marathi.  In Pune I only speak in Marathi.  But in Mumbai I have to speak in Hindi.  So those who like to learn languages, should learn Marathi.  It is a language to learn.  And it is such a wonderful language that our Namdeva, who was a saint, a very big, a very great saint, was called by Guru Nanak and he told him to learn Punjabi language and write his poetry in Punjabi.  And Namdevji wrote such a thick book, all in Punjabi language.  I too was able to speak in Punjabi when I lived in Punjab.  If you can learn Marathi, then, excepting Tamil language, you can learn any other language.  Maybe you will be able to learn a few Tamil words but not the whole language!

In this situation, where there are fourteen languages spoken in this country, fourteen official languages,   you will be surprised we have fourteen languages in this country. So I will say this that if you learn Marathi, you will manage to learn at least 8 or 9 of these fourteen languages.  Now one more thing which is wonderful! The Bible has been translated, in all its purity, in Marathi language.

In these parts there was a very noble lady called Rama Devi.  She was a scholar, and very learned.  She made a translation of all the writings in the Bible, in its purest form, in Marathi language.  In that she has used Marathi names, like for John she has used Yohan, and for Matthews she has used Matthai.  So the Bible that I have read was in Marathi, and that is why, many times there is confusion.  And she has written it in all its purity.  She has written everything very clearly and distinctly.  She has maintained its purity, and in that she has written that when Christ went to a wedding he made water into the juice of grapes.  It is a very basic principle that she has written in Marathi.

The second amazing thing is that there is no mention in the English language Bible about the childhood and boyhood of Christ.  I don’t know if you have ever heard a poetry piece about the description of Christ’s childhood.  I have never heard one.  But in Marathi we have many.  Now just yesterday they sang beautifully. After seeing your face, your child’s face, Baal Vadan, all my fears run away.  So all this part is missing in the Western languages.  I think that the childhood themes are not there.  We have about Shri Krishna, about Shri Rama, when they were children how they used to walk, how they used to talk, how they used to put their finger in the mouth.  Everything.  Every little little thing is described so beautifully about children.  And that is why Indians cannot think at all of killing their children.  Impossible situation.  No romance, even in Hindi language.  In Marathi language we have such beautiful descriptions of these incarnations as children.  Then the third thing.

The second thing is that all the romance is in the time before the marriage.  All before marriage.  After marriage there is no romance at all.

Third thing is that there is no romance described after marriage.  All before marriage.  It is the other way around in Indian languages.  All the romance comes when you are married.  Very sweet, sweet things.  I was surprised.  I asked somebody to find one English book where they have described romance of the married couple.  None!  Finished!  All the romance is over.  Once you are married it is finished.  Then what do you do.  You quarrel, you fight, you go to the courts and take a divorce.  That description is not there.  And this is why our Indian culture has bestowed a great benefaction on us.  Very big.

So I read the Bible translated into Marathi.  And whatever is written there, it has great depth.  The English language has changed the essential nature, is what I feel.  And even with regard to Christ, the sacred identity and spiritual significance has been preserved in the Marathi translation of the Bible.  This is not there in the Hindi translation, nor is it there in the English version.

The third thing is that the Maharashtrian is a man of self esteem and self confidence.  Just like the people of Rajasthan and Mewar.  Also have a lot of pride in the self.  They would not learn or copy anything from the British.  If the English tried to teach them they would say “Let it be. Let it be.” In Marathi; or “Leave it, leave it.  We have seen many like you” in Hindi.  But in the North of India I have seen that they are greatly impressed by the English.  Wearing suits and boots!  Knotting a tie around the neck, putting on boots, and commanding and ordering others.

Not so in Maharashtra.  To get a Maharashtrian to wear a suit is the most difficult thing.  They wear dhotis.  Even educated people wear only dhotis.  You can see that Tilak, who became such a great leader in the country, or Ranade, or Agarkar;  all wore dhotis.  No one wore suits and boots.  No one used to wear  tie or anything.  Of course if they were highly placed in government jobs, that was a different matter.  They may or may not wear. But here, even to be employed in a government job was considered below ones dignity and status  In Maharashtra you must be knowing that many times it has been asked “Why do you not like to take a government job”, and they would mention the names of three or four government officials as an example that they were doing well, and others also should come forward.  But there is no honor or glory attached to a government job.  My father used to say that working for someone was inferior.  Better to have your own profession.  And a government job is the lowest form of employment.  It destroys a person’s future and reputation.  And I observed that there was a lot of truth in this line of thought.

But now, if someone comes into the IAS (Indian Administrative Service) then finished.  His value goes up in the marriage market – 30 lakhs, 35 lakhs.  In North India an IAS Officer is considered a prime catch.  But here, if a man is educated, if he is a scholar, he is highly respected and appreciated; and most of all, if he is spiritually and morally sound.  This is the very great difference.

And that is why in the early days in Delhi, I used to think what will these people understand.  But it is most amazing, that in Delhi Sahaja Yoga has spread so wide,  in Lucknow also.  I just cannot imagine.  With whose blessings has it happened.  These people were so servile to the British.  What has happened to them now.  How did they get transformed.  I feel that the place where Shri Rama and Shri Krishna, made their Divine Abodes, it is their blessings.  There is no other explanation.  Especially Lucknow which was a place of excessive indulgence – eat, drink and make merry.  All indulgent and carefree.  I always hesitated because I did not know how to handle such people and what to say to them.  All their relationships, their style of talking and living I just couldn’t understand.  I had gone from Maharashtra, and I just didn’t understand their way of life.  They were constantly pulling each other’s legs, even within relations such as sisters-in-law, mother-in-law, daughters-in-law.  It never made sense to me,  and never could enter My brain.

And now I perceive the blessings of Shri Rama and Shri Krishna, the poetry of Kabir, and the blessings of Nanak Sahib.  Oh! These people of Punjab.  I studied in Punjab, and I felt that what kind of people are these.  Sahaja Yoga will never enter their brains.  And now I am amazed!  I am very amazed!  So much bhakti, and so much bliss and joy.  How did they attain this.  There were no big Public Program there, nor did any one give big lectures.  How did all this happen.

Now in Maharashtra I really spent a lot of time and effort.  My oh My!  So many villages and hamlets I visited and worked very hard.  But nothing like this happened in Maharashtra.  Whatever atmosphere and quality was there in North India, was not in Maharashtra.  It is really surprising.  I thought, all My efforts in Maharashtra will go in vain.  On the contrary they got after Me with the greatest seeking and pure desire for spirituality.  So, I discovered one thing.  That there were a lot of false gurus operating over here.  So many Gurus.  Everyone had a personal guru. Gurus in the house. Family gurus.  It was overrun with gurus!

Even in the Panchaang (almanac) every guru’s name, date of birth and place of birth was recorded.  And all completely useless people.  Of course there were a few genuine gurus among these, but very few.  Very few.  And the rest were worthless, manipulating rogues.

This land of Maharashtra is so large, and so sacred.  So many places have been blessed and dedicated by the different aspects of the Devi – Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati  Mahakali, and Adi Shakti.  And in this holy land there are eight Vinayakas, and Mahavinayaka.  All in this sacred place.  They are all sitting here.  Yes, one thing is there, that these people are not immoral or wicked; but they do not have the wisdom and capacity to exert to find the truth, or to understand what is Dharma.  They only know the outward practices of going to the temples, ringing the bells, and running after gurus for salvation.  They like to be involved in rites and ceremonies.  There is no other problem of obscenity or immorality with them.  They are so steeped in conditionings that they are not able to come out of them.

I have given you the analysis of the situation.  That the foreigners from whom I had no expectations whatsoever, I used to feel what kind of people are these.  They will be of no use.  They have no understanding of anything, and they have reached such heights.  And the people of the North who I never thought would come into Sahaja Yoga.  I used to call them Dilli ki Billi (Felines of Delhi).  My marriage took place in Delhi.  My father also lived in Delhi and further North from Delhi, Punjab, U.P. all places, Rajasthan, Sahaya Yoga has spread.  But this is a kind of misfortune of Maharashtra.  But then it was by Divine Design that you all came to Maharashtra, brought your Chaitanya to Maharashtra, and a lot of awakening can take place.  And people can experience that by your coming here, your attention also comes to this place, and by that all the false gurus who are sitting here – they are still here, lots of them.  In Maharashtra there is a saying “Ucchal Bangdi”  will happen.  I cannot tell you the translation of this.

The job of picking them up and throwing them out can only be achieved only by your Chaitanya.  Especially today, when you are worshiping the great spiritual life and teachings of Jesus Christ and His divinity  I would say all the false gurus who are sitting here, and who Christ would have whipped with a hunter if He was here; all the false gurus would be compelled to pick up their wares and run away.  And I don’t know where they will go.  They have made a lot of money, and befooled many people.  This foolishness is also a kind of simple-mindedness.  Any guru comes they will prostate at his feet.  There are a lot of feet touching devotees here!

Today when you are worshiping the holiest of holy life of Christ, I would say that

I wonder from where this failing of allowing ourselves to be befooled has come.  Anyone comes, teaches anything we are willing to accept as the highest belief.  Gurudev has come.  Gurudev has come.  It is due to this blind following that the spiritual culture of Maharashtra has been devoured and destroyed.  And I would say that, today when you are worshiping the holiest of holy, life of Christ, the weapons of His innocence and purity will manifest, and through the power of Shri Ganesha, the destruction of these negative forces will work out, and in Maharashtra the spiritual awakening will happen. And they will achieve that Param Tattwa (Divine essence) and spiritual treasure which is the highest reality and which existed in so many saints here.   And all these false gurus will have to pick up their wares and leave.  And I don’t know where they will go.  They have amassed a lot of money from these gullible people.  But it is a kind of ignorance and foolishness, and unawareness on their part.

There was no saint who did not mention about Kundalini.  Saints, one greater than the other, lived in this land and spoke about spiritual awakening.  In this kind of land, even I could not succeed.  But I congratulate you for coming here.  Your coming will definitely put sense into these people.  They will realize that they were just running after false gurus.  I am telling you all this because many people suggested that Mother, instead of Ganapatiphule have your program in our place.  But I said “No!  You come! Because it is your duty and responsibility that you bring about awakening within everybody.

It was imperative to bring spiritual awakening to Maharashtra, and so you had to come here, and honor and worship Shri Jesus Christ.  This was the greatest necessity.  He will take the whip to all these false gurus and finish them off.  And therefore, your resolve to come here and worship and manifest His supreme divinity, and with His divinity Maharashtra becomes purified and holy.  They do a lot of worshiping of Shri Ganesha.  But what Shri Ganesha is, and what does He stand for, all this they do not know, and are not interested to know.  I don’t understand this.  They are so entangled in this mess;  and to release them it was necessary for you to come here.  And that you come every year, year after year, and worship and celebrate the Birthday of Christ is a great undertaking.

My unending blessings to all of you.
