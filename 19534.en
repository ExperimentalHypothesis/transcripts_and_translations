Christmas Puja. Ganapatipule (Maharashtra, India), 25 December 1998.

First, I'll speak in English and then in Hindi.
Today, long time back, Christ was born. You all know the story of His birth, and of all the sufferings He had to go through. He’s the One who has given us the model of Sahaja Yoga. For He didn’t live for Himself, in no way, but He lived for others, working out the Agnya Chakra.
You may be Divine, you may be very powerful, but this world is so cruel that they don’t understand spirituality, they don’t understand the spiritual greatness. Not only that, but they are many factors which attack spirituality, they have always done it. Every saint has suffered a lot, but I think Christ has suffered the most. As you know, He was endowed with all the powers of Shri Ganesh, as He is the reincarnation of Shri Ganesha.
The first of them was His innocence: He was the eternal child, we should say that He could not understand the cruelty and the hypocrisy of this stupid world. Still if you can understand, what can you do about it? But with great courage, He took birth in a country where people had no idea of spirituality.
I read a book about Him, saying that He came to Kashmir, where He met one of My forefathers Shalivana. It’s very interesting, because it is all in Sanskrit, and the writer perhaps did not know Sanskrit, so he has given everything in Sanskrit language, which is not very congenial, I am sure, to the Western people. Thank God, he did not know Sanskrit, otherwise it would have been very dangerous. It’s written in that, that he asked Christ: “Why have You come to India?” So He said: “This is My country, that’s why I’ve come here, where people respect spirituality. But I live among people who do not understand spirituality at all.” His conversation with Him was very, very interesting, because Shalivana said that: “There is more reason that You should go back to Your country and teach them Nirmala Tattwa.” That’s the principle of purification. He went back, after three and a half years, He was crucified.
I personally think the big difference between the Western execution and Indian is that in the West, killing is a very great profession. With the slightest pretext they kill people. Anybody who is a saint was killed or they called him a madcap. That’s the best way to avoid spirituality. While in India, if a saint says anything, then he is not challenged, never! But they believe in it, because he is a saint, he is a much higher personality than we are. Though they were very nasty people around and they tortured them, but as a whole, the public, the people, respected them.
If they are false gurus, normally they don’t stay in this country, because they know they'll be found out. Also they are so money-oriented [Shri Mataji laughts delicatly] that they go to America or to some foreign countries and settle down there to make money.

This is one of the signs, one should say. This may be one of the reasons why Christ was born in a very, very ordinary family. He had no proper bed to sleep as a child also. It’s all described: where He slept, how His mother and father lived in a place where there were cows and calves. It was to show that spirituality does not need any luxury, doesn’t need any pompous show. It is a power within. It is a glow and a light within which shows, automatically. You do not have to do anything to show it out. Such a person does not have any sense of money and other things as positions.
He was bothered about people who were suffering physically, even the lepers, and He tried to cure them, He tried to help so many people who were sick physically. Because at that time, there were no hospitals, no doctors, so His attention was drawn to people who were suffering physically. Also mentally, He tried to prepare them: there are so many beautiful sermons on the mountain. In a way, that time, people were not so materialistic, so they listened to Him. We can’t say how many understoodHim.

It’s very important that if you are not a realised soul, then it is difficult to understand spirituality. The one is talking about spirituality and the one who is listening to his, both of them must have minimum of realisation.
So from His beautiful life that I see, we have to learn that, unless and until we are realised souls, we will be torturing the Spirit of Christ. We have seen it’s happening: “All those who talk of Christ”, He has said it very clearly, “they will be calling Me “Christ, Christ!” I won’t recognise you.” Very clearly, He has said it, I don’t know why they didn’t remove it from the Bible.
It means those who will talk and preach and dress up to show off that they are spiritual in the name of Christ, He will not recognise them. It’s as simple as that! And this time now, when it’s the Last Judgement, He is going to judge the whole world on the basis of spirituality, which means vibrations. His Judgement has already started. I’ve seen it, you can see, in so many countries, things are just disappearing, all their ego, all their aggressiveness, all their cruelty are being challenged. And those who did wrong in the war also are taken to task. So in the history also, those who have done wrong to any community, to any people, they all will be taken to task. They had no business to be aggressive on people and to torture them. This is what is Shri Ganesha’s principle acting through Sahaja Yoga. Christ didn’t say that, but He did say: “There will be Last Judgement.” On one side, He was very kind and compassionate, on the other side, He was really Shri Ganesha, because He took a hunter to hit the people who were selling things in the temple. You cannot have business in the name of religion. What a big thing it is to understand. But the Christians didn’t follow that, they did not! I don’t know where have they gone. As we have Mahatma Gandhi who talked of spirituality and nothing else. “Adhyatma” [related to the Self, the Spirit] all the time. But his successors who came, put him somewhere with his spirituality and started a new world, new ideas, and a new style of life. Those who are supposed to be his followers are now wanting to have many pubs, and also all kinds of things, can you imagine? This Congress was started by Mahatma Gandhi, and the Congress followers are doing all this. Where are they going to lead? The beauty of this country is, the treasure of this country is spirituality. Instead of taking to spirituality, where are they going? They may not be Christians, but they respect Christ, they respect Bible. I must tell you it’s a fact people don’t know. They are not Christians, means in the sense, they are not baptised, but they respect, because they understand that there was so much of spirituality about Christ. He was the personification of spirituality. That’s the beauty ofIndians, that somebody is a Hindu or is a Muslim makes no difference. There were many Muslims who were Saints and Sufis in India, they are all respected by everyone, whether they are Muslims or Hindus.
So for Christ, nobody has any objection at all. On the contrary, you saw yesterday how they were all happy about it, because they are realised souls. But even if they are not, in this country, Christ is very much respected. They can’t understand: How can they scrutinise the life of Christ? How can they judge Him and how can they make vulgar films about it? This, they can’t bear it, because the respect that they have for spirituality exists very much more than it exists outside. Because in the name of Christ, people have done such a lot of wrong. Such a lot of killing has been done, all kinds of wrong things have been accepted. With all this, one does not understand how they have judged Christ.
For example, what I know, in England I saw, I was shocked that if somebody dies, they drink; if somebody’s born, they drink. Drinking is the only way they have relationships. [Shri Mataji laughts delicately] “How can you drink?” I asked them. He said: “Why? Christ created wine.” “When?” “In a wedding.” I said: “In a wedding? That was not wine, that was just the juice of the grapes that they grew there.” We call it “drakshas” [made out of grapes] in our language. How can that be wine? It has to be first fermented, it has to be rotten, how can that be?"
So this is the biggest Dharma: to drink! But in India, we know, though nobody has said anything against drinking, but we know drinking is a sinful thing. You see it every day: everybody knows that if you drink, you become absolutely out of your mind. That's not a thing to be said on a religious platform, but everybody knows that what this drinking is. Not that people abroad don't know, they also know. But somehow it has become a fashion. Even in our country, it has been now introduced. I don't know how, after Independence, people have started drinking. Every party, they drink. Also in the name of Christ, on Christmas Day. It's such an insult to His beautiful holy life. So when they came on this earth, perhaps all their powers of holiness were destroyed.

A very good thing about India, Indians say that at least they respect, they respect the holy places. That is something good about her. And they know what this holiness is. Now of course they are becoming very modern and Americanised, but still they know what is wrong, what should not be done.
With Sahaja Yoga now, I am very happy to say that the foreign Sahaja Yogis also have become very beautiful. I'm surprised, because in their cultures, there is no spirituality. But I don't know how they left all that nonsense and have come out like lotuses beautifully, with such beautiful fragrance of spirituality. This is something, a miracle. Everybody says: "Mother, we can't believe it, how could it have happened? How could You manage this?" I would say it's the blessing of Christ.
They saw how people are working out in the name of Christ in a very degraded manner, and they developed a kind of an awareness, that definitively something is wrong with it: this is not Christ, this is not His holy life they are depicting, it's something else. And that is how, I think, in the West there's a greater urge, a greater ascending force.

Yesterday somebody came and told Me: "Mother, there's no collective meditation." I was very happy to hear that. What is most important is meditation in Sahaja Yoga, no doubt about it. But the foreigners, they do meditation much more than Indians do, very surprising. And foreign men and women are very highly equipped, I must say, as far as spirituality is concerned.

Specially Russians, I was surprised that in America, they told Me: "Mother, these Americans are NOT Sahaja Yogis!" I said: "Why?" "They don't have that respect for You, they don't meditate. Those who do not meditate are not Sahaja Yogis." I said: "I agree." And they made all the Americans to meditate! I don't know why in this Eastern Block, people, Bulgaria and so on, Russians, Romanians, how they have taken to Sahaja Yoga so much. Of course, they had the curse of communism on them. Maybe that they felt that they had missed something in life and they went deep down into themselves. And that is how they have achieved it.
But I have to tell Indians that they have to meditate. Indians have one or two very bad qualities. And that is, one of them is "groupism". For example, if they are Bhramins, they will sit together; if they are this caste, they will sit together; if they are Bhanyas, they will sit together. If that is not so, then by another name, they will group together. This is the worse curse of My country, because once you start grouping together, you can never see the good of others and you can never see the bad of yourself. This grouping together can bring lots of problem in this country.

At the time of Christ, they had very different type of view: either they were interested in spirituality, or they were not. Now we have people here who are interested in spirituality, but still their one leg is in the water, where the age-old problems still exist. And this is the ruin of our country. We cannot combine together, we cannot be friends with each other. Of course not in Sahaja Yoga, I must say it has been solved very well.
But if you see, even at the time of Christ, He had problems with His disciples. Specially something happened with Peter and he is the one who said: "A Satan will meet you." Because I think people fall into the group of satanic forces. And He said that He removed the satanic devils from many people and put them in the pigs. It's true, there is a satanic force which is working very strongly. The more we develop security of spirituality, the more they will develop. The satanic force is in a different form in the West and in a different form in the East. But I would like to tell for them to be careful how to find out the satanic forces in the West. You may not be affected by that, because you are realised souls, but you'll have to fight it, you'll have to fight it.
For example, racialism: racialism is still very powerful there, very very powerful. And you have to fight racialism through marrying people who belong to other races. But still I find it difficult to marry a Black person to a White person. It's an impossible situation. If I try that, I don't know what happens. Once we had such a marriage, I must tell you, and a White lady, French lady, was married to a Black man. Instead of the French lady dominating, this Black man dominated. So I was quite surprised, you know, how could that be? So the reason was, I think he was taking the revenge, maybe the respite.

So first of all tremendous love and affection has to grow between the people. This colour is so skin-deep, it has nothing to do with the love inside, nothing! It's so skin-deep. Thanks God, in our country, you can have a wife who will be very dark, husband will be very fair or vice-versa. But they never look at that from that angle. I don't think that exists in this country.
But we have another kind: you see, just is a typical human problem is that he discriminates; through ego, which, I must say, Christ has tried to fight your ego. He was born in a very humble family. And He was not a white-skinned man, no! In your language, He was brown, but in Indian language, He was black.
But when it comes to spirituality, you just see the enlightened one, you don't see what colour they have the skin. It's very, very superficial, but this is one of the enemies of the Western life which, I think, must be conquered.
Materialism is another one, but the worst of all which is against Christ is immorality. Immorality is so much accepted in the West. All kinds of immoral behaviour is accepted. Like they say that, all these immoral people say: "Vote for somebody", he becomes the President of America. It's alright, does not matter. All kinds of immorality is allowed. But that is ABSOLUTELY against Christ, absolutely! People don't understand that immorality will lead them to a kingdom which I don't know what to call, because it's even worse than animal kingdom. And they are so immoral, they listen to people like Freud, as if they have no brains, they have no Spirit, to take note of such a man.

Only after Sahaja Yoga, the model of Christ life you can have. Whatever is past is over and finished. Today now you are realised souls and morality is your strength. Forget about the past and I'm sure you can get many more people under the banner of Sahaja Yoga if you lead a very, very moral life.
At the same time, another very bad enemy we have is our anger. So, they are very proud, they'll say: "I'll now get angry." "You know, I'm very angry." They are not ashamed about it. And they go on saying that: "I'm very angry", as if it's not wrong to say: "I'm very angry." Now they say: "I hate", I mean, imagine any Indian language they'd use this word, it would mean "I am committing sin".
So all this aggressiveness comes from anger. If somebody has to be angry, he should be angry with himself. Best is to get rid of anger: you can pull your hair, you can bite yourself, you can use your pillow to hit yourself! [laughs] That may be the best way to take out your anger.
But see for what you are angry: sometimes it's absolutely useless, sometimes it has no meaning, sometimes it's absolutely maddening stupid! But as long as you stop saying: "I am very angry", that's it, that's the time you should understand you are falling down completely.
So Christ didn't talk of all the subtle things I have been talking to you, because that was left to Me: without realisation, how can you talk about subtler things? You cannot!

Last time, I told you about the vibrations, what it is and what it stands for and how you get the subtle energy that we call as "Tanmatra", of our light, Tej, of water, Jal, and Vayu, Agni. But I didn't tell you of one, very special one which is in English language you call it Ether. But Ether is another energy which is managed by another Tanmatra, we call it Akash. Especially today, because it's Christ who has sacrificed His life to open our Agnya Chakra that we have reached that state of Akash. Without Him, it would not have been possible.
We can have general communication, like we can talk to people, we can say things, we can also use our fingers to express ourselves, our hands to communicate. But to communicate vibrations, you have to have vibrations. Otherwise you cannot feel another person. But if you are at the Agnya level, means you are mental, absolutely MENTAL, then your vibrations also are dwindling, in the sense you don't know really what they are saying. You can't judge your vibrations because these vibrations are mental. They say: "Mother, we asked the vibrations." I say: "Really? But you don't have any vibrations, how can you ask the vibrations?" Very common thing: "We asked the vibrations, we found from the vibrations". It's not possible, because you are just MENTAL. Now what Christ has done is to put you AWAY from the mental level, that is the most difficult. While I am surprised, those who follow Christianity have the WORST mental position, they are mentally absolutely there, I don't know how to call, like the fog of Delhi… [laughs] that you can't cross! That fog was broken by Christ. How much we should be obliged to Him, that He removed the greatest hurdle in the human ascent and that one was to break this Agnya, the mental being within us.
We read like mad, we listen to people like mad, we like those who give us food for our mental brain. They are so mental, so argumentative, think no end of their intelligence that you just have to say: “All right, Namaskar!” You can’t fight their mental attitude.

That’s why Christ is to be worshipped by people who are so very mental. And this mental nonsense has given such a sense of superiority to people –“Oh, whatever we do… What’s wrong? What’s wrong?” They cannot correct themselves, because, unless and until you cross this limit of mental being, you cannot see yourself. You cannot introspect, you cannot see yourself. You’ll see others: “These Sahaja Yogis are like this… Sahaja Yoga is like that…” –all kinds of things. But you can’t see yourself, because the whole thing is mental.
This mental attitude should be completely curbed through the help of our Lord Jesus Christ. But He is only mental –in your brains, Christ is also mental, now what to do? The one who broke the mental attitude is also mental –you have made Him into mental like a statue of stone.

So firstly we have to tell ourselves: “Now, don’t think, don’t think, don’t think, don’t think!” Four times. And then you can rise above it. And this is very important. In meditation, you have to go beyond the mind and, thanks to Christ, that He is sitting at the Agnya, to finish off this nonsense of mental being. I think people should stop reading also, perhaps, maybe. Even My lecture becomes mental, what to do? I mean, everything that goes into their head becomes mental, somehow, and then they ask Me questions: “Mother, did You say this way?” I said: “I said it to make you thoughtless, just to stun you. I didn’t say this to sit down and analyse and do… no, no. I said this, that you should become absolutely shocked and stunned.”
So, the best thing for all of you is to become thoughtless. That’s the blessing of Christ, that’s what He worked it out for and I am sure if you work it out, that don’t pay attention to others... Don’t react, just don’t react. Everything they will see, they will react. What is the need? What is the use? What are you going to do with that reaction? This reaction creates nothing but ripples of thoughts in your minds –I have told you hundreds of times and now you have to become absolutely thoughtless after this Puja.

If that happens, I think we have achieved a lot. That’s the biggest blessing that Christ has given you, which you should really enjoy. Then only this Akash Tattwa in you will work. And how it works? Through your attention. It works with Me, as you know.

With My attention, I work out many things. How? Just My attention has become thoughtless. Just thoughtless. It goes, wherever it goes, it works. But if you put your attention for thought all the time, for thinking, then it doesn’t do the work that it is supposed to do. Attention works marvellously, if you are thoughtless, otherwise it doesn’t. So it has to rise from your own self, then from others, to the higher level of humanity, where you are in communication with the sky, with we can call it as the “Tanmatra” or the essential or the essence of ether.
With ether, you can have television, you can have telephone, it’s a miracle otherwise. But with this Tanmatra, sitting down here, you can do the job, it works. Just attention works, I know that, you also know very well.
You don’t have to ask Me to put the attention, you just put attention and it will work. It is a very important thing that you have got. I think that is the first thing, once you have - no problem.
But we start manifesting from the Earth element. Then from the Agni element, then from the Jal element and then we come to Tejas, that the face starts shining. But lastly we get this thoughtless awareness by which our attention is absolutely free to do some special work.

But if you are all the time thinking, then, poor, this attention is so busy, you know, so very busy. You don’t have to ask Me then: “Mother, please pay attention”, you can pay attention and you can work it out.
In this attention, you don’t feel what you got, what you're standing, what you are wearing, what others are doing – no, nothing! You are one with yourself.

And it’s a life full of humour, so much humour, so much of joy, so much of happiness, that you don’t care for anything that normally people care for.

So, as it is now, Sahaja Yoga has worked in so many countries. I am so very proud of you, very proud of you. And now it is also going to African countries, it’s a very great satisfaction for Me. And you all can do it. You all can work it out. Only thing, become thoughtlessly aware, as the blessing of Christ. If it works, you will be absolutely enjoying yourself.
May God bless you!
