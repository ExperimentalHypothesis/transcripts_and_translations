Public Program, Vienna (Austria), 8 June 1988.

I bow to all the seekers of truth.

Today we find in the whole world a great inner movement to seek the truth. This movement has come because we feel that so far whatever we have tried we have not been very successful. We are not being happy, satisfied. All kinds of ideologies, religions came into being. But they have failed to give what they promised about it. This failure for every honest and thinking man has opened a new era of seeking. And this era of seeking has to culminate into something substantial, has to give the light of reality to people and not just talking.

If you categorize the past enterprises of people into politics or into religion you can easily see the principle behind it was either money-oriented or power-oriented. All religions have been money-oriented. They use the name of great incarnations to make money. And people also very humbly accepted that, "We have to pay money to these people who are teaching us religion."

The another side of all these religious bodies have been to give us a kind of a idea that they are very powerful. They make you fight with each other. These organizations have created soldiers out of you; militaries out of you. This has happened in the past and it is happening even today. We have to be very alert and understand that God does not want you to fight among yourselves. God has created only one world. Human beings are saying that, "We are this and we are that." They talk of peace and unity when there is no peace in their hearts. There are scandals and scandals coming out of these so called religions. Wars after wars you find they are fighting in the name of religion.

It's not only that I would say Hindus are like that, or the Christians are like that, or Muslims are like that. All of them have been I would say in a way lured into something that is extremely false. Religion is within ourselves. We are human beings and that is our Religion. Of course great people like Christ, like Rama, like Krishna, Mohammed Sahib, Nanaka, all these great people came on this earth to teach us this inner religion. But what we find today that in the name of all these great prophets we are all separated, divided, fighting each other.

So this innate inner religion within us is like our valency, as carbon has four valencies human beings have ten valencies. Now whatever I am telling to you, you must listen to Me like scientist with open mind. Think that this is a hypothesis I am putting before you. But the time has come to prove this hypothesis, that this religion is within ourselves. It is within everyone of us. You may belong to any country, you may belong to any ideology, any race - this religion exists within us. It has to be awakened.

Once it is awakened you'll be surprised that we are all part and parcel of the Whole. Those who are identified with all these falsehood have to know that it is not going to do any good to you, nor to your children, nor to the progeny - but it will destroy this world. We can see the destruction coming to us through various conditionings of these horrible ideas of religion.

Take the idea now about Christianity, because here I think I should talk about Christianity rather then about Hinduism. Recently I saw a film called 'Gnostic'. And 'Gn' in Sanskrit language means 'to know'. And Saint Thomas on his way to India had written lots of things about Christ and had put them in a big jar in Egypt. And this jar was opened only about 48 years back. And some scientists have worked on it and have brought it to the English language. Also this book 'Gnostic' - which anybody can read.

I was Myself born in a Christian religion and I used to wonder, "What sort of a Christianity is this?" And this book really has challenged all that. Saint Thomas has said, "You don't have to give up your family-life, there is no sin in marriage and having children. God has created this world for you to enjoy His love. There is no need to suffer."

This is just, I think, people tell us to suffer, because they enjoy our sufferings, perhaps. You don't have to suffer because Christ has suffered for us. Are we going to suffer more than Christ? Has He left anything for us to suffer? He has already opened the gate for us. So why do these people ask us to suffer and to lead an austere life, insipid life - suppressing our natural life? It's all a drama, I think, people want to play - to impress people, to get into powers. All against Christ, all activity seems to be Anti-Christ. This I felt from My very, very childhood and I've seen it more and more happening. We have big, big organizations - for what? To collect money, that's all!

Are we following Christ? Christ has said, "Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes!" How many Christians have such eyes, so pure? He has said, "You are to be born again." So people brand themselves as 'born again', collect lot of money, create a scandal and disappear. Let us face the truth. This is not reality. And not for our benevolence at all. There's no sincerity about it. And we have to be kind to ourselves. We have to be born again. We have to become the Spirit. We have to have our Self Realization.

Today somebody asked Me, that why should I come and talk to the Western people? I told him that in My mind there is nothing like East and West. The Western culture, the Western enterprises, endeavours are like the growth of a tree, but they do not know about their roots. When the tree grows and grows, without paying attention to its roots, without knowing from where do you get your nourishment, it would be totally destroyed one day. From the East you have to know about the roots. And East has benefited from your knowledge of science, of all this growth outward - why not the tree benefit from the knowledge of the roots?

This nourishment comes to us spontaneously from a happening that has to take place within us. That happening is not mental, it is not emotional, neither it is some sort of a physical acrobat. It is the inner awakening of a residual force within us, called Kundalini. This Kundalini is the reflection of the Holy Ghost - about which no priest can talk. She is the Primordial Mother, She is the Primordial Power, She is the power of Divine Love. And in a subtle form She exists in every atom and every molecule. We have never felt It before - but is described very clearly in so many scriptures that It is the Cool Breeze of the Holy Ghost. You have to feel the Cool Breeze oft the Holy Ghost, of the Pentecost, as they call it. Of the Pentecost. But the way people think Pentecost is, that to get possessed is the way it is Pentecost. When the disciples of Christ started talking about the centers and about the channels, they thought they were talking in some other language. So some people think, if they get possessed and start screaming and shouting, now they have got the blessings of the Holy Ghost. This is sheer madness. If you are blessed by the Holy Ghost, you will become much more aware, much more dynamic, much more compassionate. You have to become a blissful personality. And you have to become the witness - that you can see the whole drama very well. So it is a state which one has to achieve. It is not just a ritual of putting some water on your heads and saying, "You are baptized." Actually when you are really baptized you get the Cool Breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area. So please do not identify yourself with all such false dramas that are played around, because it is not going to do you any good.

In these modern times scientifically we can say one thing, that it is the last breakthrough, is the epitome of our evolution, where you enter into that subtle power of knowledge, so that you feel on your fingertips the all-pervading Power. And you feel your own centers and the centers of others, in the new era of collective consciousness. This collective consciousness is an expanded awareness of your central nervous system. But talking about it one should not believe. One has to experience. One has to see for one self.

If it is the living process - how can you pay for it? The people who ask money for religion are really hungry wolves. This is a living process, which is something like a seed sprouting. What do we pay to the Mother Earth for giving us such beautiful fruits and such beautiful lush greenery? What efforts can we put in? It's spontaneous, it works spontaneously. The Divine is anxious to reveal Itself to you, but you have to keep your minds open. And think of your benevolence and your own powers and your higher state which you can easily get. It's all your own. Just like one candle which is enlightened can enlighten another candle which is ready. It just happens that way. Not by arguments, not by discussions - but by living force within us which has not yet come into play.

There have been lots of misunderstanding about Kundalini - specially in German language there have been very funny books, I know about them. That shows people have not gone thoroughly into it to find out the truth. Kundalini doesn't trouble anyone, She is your Mother, She gives you birth, She takes all the trouble.

Now, the problem with our own understanding is that either we are too much conditioned, even by science, or we are identified with some falsehood. For this a simple example is that if you are holding on to say - some sort of a snake and there is no light - no use telling you about it. But when you have the light then you yourself will drop it. So when your Kundalini brings the light of your Spirit in your attention you become aware - fully aware, because now you know the absolute truth on your fingertips.

Mohammed Sahib has said that, "At the time of Kiyama" - that is resurrection - "your hands will speak and your fingers will give witness against you." And what are the Muslims doing? And what are the Hindus doing? (Shri Mataji laughing) Naturally with all this one does not want to believe in any religion, in God or anything - they become atheist. Even Buddha felt the same way. And He said, "Better not talk about God, only talk of Self Realization." Because if you talk of God, people just try to take to something that is artificial. There has been lot of effort by all these prophets, by all these incarnations to take us out of the ocean of illusion.

Now, you don't have to have any effort, no money - but an open mind to see for yourself.

May God bless you!

Tomorrow I will again come and explain to you little more about how we get into diseases and into troubles. Now I would say, if you have any questions you can ask Me, but ask relevant questions. There's no need to be aggressive because I've not come here to take anything from you - but to give you something that is your own. If you do not want to have it I cannot force, it cannot be forced. It has to work out. Like the way Christ has described the parable that, "Some seeds fell on the rock, but some fell on the fertile land - and they became the trees."

May God bless you!

I would like you to ask Me some questions.

Question: Shall I ask You the questions like this or - I don't know?

Shri Mataji: Now, what he say? Come here, come here. Nearly. Now, so you want to come - you come along. I may now tell you that.

Question: Are you considering yourself of being God?

Shri Mataji: Self?

Question: Are you considering yourself of being God?

Shri Mataji: Self - what?

Question: Are you considering yourself of being God?

Shri Mataji: Now he is asking Me a question, am I considering Myself as God? Now the answer is like that: I am not going to tell you anything about Myself, because Christ said, "I am the only Son of God, and I am the light, and I am the path," which was the truth but people crucified Him. I don't want to get crucified. (Laughter) So I am sorry! (Applause) You should find out yourself. And this is not the way you will get your Realization. You think about yourself rather then about Me, all right? Thank you!

Question: I have another question.

Translator: Should I translate?

Question: I didn't ask this questions just to be provocant ...

Shri Mataji: No, no, I cannot be provoked. (Shri Mataji laughing)

Question: I just wanted to know something: Because you said there is a big illusion and you are, one can be led out of this illusion. So I ask, why is this illusion?

Shri Mataji: That is because of ignorance.

Question: Are the people stupid or ignorant or - why are they like this? (Shri Mataji laughing)

Shri Mataji: No, they are lovely people, not stupid - but they are ignorant, still ignorant, that's all. They have to have the knowledge.

Question: They have a lack of development?

Shri Mataji: I would say they are not yet fully evolved. All right? It's a good question. Only one step forward, one step forward and you jump into the ocean of knowledge.

Question: Is this the knowledge Eva received, when she bite into the apple?

Shri Mataji: Who?

Question: Is it the knowledge of this symbol of the Bible, where when Adam and Eva, and Eve, they had been in Paradise?

Shri Mataji: No.

Question: And they ate from the ...

Shri Mataji: Yes.

Question: ... tree of knowledge. Is it this kind of knowledge?

Shri Mataji: Now, you see: they ate from the tree of knowledge, disobeying God. That's why all this had to be done, the whole evolution had to be brought in. All this whole arbitrary behaviour of both of them has brought this problem to us, and this is why there is illusion. If they had listened to God we would have had all Realized Souls born. No problem, no illusion.
