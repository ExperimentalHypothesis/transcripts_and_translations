Today, she has decided to play to you Darbari Kanada.
On the tabla is Mr. Bala Krishna this is also a surprise to Me that from the South Indian to this, you see, from Aditala to Tritala, it’s quite difficult! [Laughter].
Babamama: He speaks Marathi, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Hum?
Babamama: He speaks Marathi.
Shri Mataji: Atcha, he speaks Marathi. Woah! Marathi means you are then finished in music!
[Laughter].
Musician: Why?
Shri Mataji: Maharashtrians are mad after music, mad. And this is husband of the great artist, he is another artist’s son, I should say.
May God bless you.

[After concert talk in English starts at 1:22:41]

After this very, very beautiful concert, I find it very difficult to express the beauty that we have enjoyed, and the delicacy of all the waves of different tunes and colours. It’s something, I feel that after Realisation, she has jumped into another realm, definitely.
[Applause]
As if she was pulling every string of my heart all the time, [Laughter; applause] with such dignity and balance. And all of you absolutely lost in the waves of that beautiful rapport you had with her.

Our music, I know I have told you hundred times, comes from the Spirit. And as you have now felt your Spirit, you can appreciate the joy. And when the Spirit manifests its light on these beautiful tunes and melodies, then it gets a very special type of a vision for all of you. And I am happy you enjoyed her thoroughly. She has got her Realization and you are all Sahaja Yogis, so naturally there was great relationship also.

Apart from that, I have discovered one thing more today, that South Indians, when they take to music, it’s not a profession, it’s a worship.
[Applause]

The purity of rendering the art is so evident, not [only] in her, but also with Mr. Balakrishna. Both of them, absolutely, the purity of it. There is no mixture, there is no cheapness, there is no publicity, or sort of a, you can say, modulated things. It’s just pure art, in the greatest purity. And this is something I discovered today.
We have to learn from South Indians this point, very important, that they render, I have seen not here, but even in Madras, whether they are dancing, they are playing violin, or they are playing their Mridangam or anything, it is for them a worship. Because of that, the purity is maintained. There is no show off, nothing. So, so deep.

And today these two artists who are from South have learnt all North Indian music. The rendering is so pure, so pure, I mean, I was just thinking of some great artists whom I have heard, because I must be the oldest woman here. And those who have been really very much, in My view, the highest, or we can call the epitome of our classical North Indian music, have been expressed through them today, definitely. No show off, nothing, it’s so beautiful.

And this is what we have to learn, that art is a worship. It’s not a profession. Many people say that those who are pujaris of Saraswati are always in trouble as far as the Lakshmi is concerned. But that’s your duty to look after their Lakshmi side. But their duty is to be purely devoted, dedicated to the art as a worship. And as audience, or you can say, as people who are enjoying that music, must look after their financial side, their Lakshmi side. And also always respect, respect the artist. Artist is to be respected because he is worshipping the Goddess Saraswati.

I can’t understand how people can be disrespectful. And in our country especially, I have seen now, there is such a big trend towards cheap type of music, that they just make fun of art. As Sahaja Yogis, you have to really understand that this is the music of the Spirit. Whether it is North or South Indian, I enjoy the same way! Whether it is South Indian or North Indian music, makes no difference to Me. Both are absolutely supreme in their own style and field.
I don’t know what to say about Mrs. Rajam. I met her because of her mother-in-law, actually. And then she has developed so much. But today, she was very much different I felt, very much closer to Me and closer to all of you.
May God bless you, Mrs. Rajam, your husband and you especially.

I hope we’ll have more chances to listen to your tabla. If you are in Bombay, it should be easier for us to get you, because she is in Banaras. Doesn’t matter. We have very small little thing for her.
[Hindi conversation]

Something for you, it’s a Maharashtrian sari. You always wear South Indian saris, but I hope you’ll enjoy this one also. And this is for you. I hope to your height it will fit, I mean. Maharashtrians are not that tall, but they make it quite high things. Let’s see. Oh, it’s all right. May God bless you.

And a small little gift from all of us.
[Hindi conversation]

You have to go to the village and order it, otherwise you don’t get it.
Mrs. Rajam: It’s very beautiful. It’s very beautiful.
Shri Mataji: There will be a blouse piece also.
Mrs. Rajam: Ji, Ji [Yes, yes].
