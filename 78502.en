[...] about all of them.

First of all, is about Hatha Yoga, where ‘ha’ and ‘tha’ mean both the channels of left and right side that we use. But those people who practice use only part of the right side. Actually, the book of Hatha Yoga is so big, written by Patanjali thousands of years back. And it was written, very clearly, that there are three aspects into which one has to go. Out of which one bit of it, one of the things is ‘Yama niyama’ means the discipline and the control. Out of which the exercise is a very, very wee part. The rest of the book is about your awakening of Kundalini, by saying what states one receives when the Kundalini rises.

But the way people do this Hatha Yoga is like taking all the medicines indiscriminately. On the contrary, when the Kundalini rises, then we know where is the problem exactly and scientifically, we should know what exercise has to be done. Some people require, very few people require these exercises. And we tell them to do it. But first, the Kundalini has to start rising.

In those ancient times, there were very few seekers, like very few flowers of the tree of life. So, at that time, they had to work out on every center gradually, cleansing it for days together, years together, on very, very few people. Shri Rama's father-in-law was Janaka who gave Realization only to one person in that Yuga, in that period. But today, it is Blossom Time. See, there are so many flowers about to become the fruits.

Moreover Sahaja Yoga, in modern times, the way I have reached it, is this way that first, somehow raise the Kundalini and open this Sahasrara, it’s the last center, so that there is some enlightenment.

Firstly, we have no time, we are busy people in modern times. And also we are rather obstinate, [to the translator] obstinate. That we want to discuss everything mentally. But in this darkness, if you tell something, nobody is listening to Me. Supposing somebody is holding on to a snake, and it is all darkness, and he believes that this snake is a rope. And if you tell that person that, " It’s a snake ", he won't listen till the snake bites him. So, with the Kundalini awakening, there is some light which comes, to begin with, and you can feel the All-pervading Power around you for the first time. In that light, you see what are your problems are, and you solve your own problems, if you know how to solve it. This is the way it will be. This is the way it will working out and once you have solved your problems, you can solve the problems of others.

So, Hatha Yoga, as it is practiced today, is only a money-oriented thing which has nothing to do with reality. Also, it creates lots of physical problems, especially emotional. If you start doing too much of this so-called yoga, you go to the right, and you become very, I should say, extremely dry personality. Such a person can develop a terrible temper. There is no kindness, there is no love. And if you have to meet anyone of such a Hatha Yogi, it’s better with a birch spoon.
[To the translator]: Birch spoon is a spoon that is used for the bulls.

So, then there is another yoga, is like Raja Yoga. I went to California where I saw people, long time back, I saw people with their tongues wagging because their threads were cut. I asked them, "What is happening? " They could not speak. They wrote it down that they started doing Raja Yoga.

Now when the Kundalini has started, it is like the ignition of a car. And as in the car, all mechanical, mechanics or the machine starts working automatically, all your machine inside also starts working. And when the Kundalini rises, first the chakras open and then they close, to keep it out there. But when it reaches here [base of the neck], then your tongue, little bit is pulled inside to close this chakra, to keep the Kundalini higher up. But you don't feel anything when it happens, it's so smooth.
Now they had cut the threads of their tongues to put the tongue back for this thing, it’s called as ‘Khechari’. But when Kundalini rises, automatically this ‘Khechari’ takes place. You don't have to do artificial things. It would be like, before starting the car, you start moving the wheels. Will the car move?

Then another one is called as the ‘Integral Yoga of Aurobindo’. It is just talk, talk, talk, talk, talk. Books after books, of all kinds of nonsense, giving no knowledge of reality. That is the reason I have not yet written any book. Because reading cannot take you to reality. Like, in the scripture, it is written that you take your second birth. So now you go on, just that's a prescription, you go on reading, you take your second birth, you take your second birth. So if you have a headache and I tell you that, "Please take this medicine", write it down the medicine, you go on reading the name of the medicine. Will your headache go or increase?

Then we have so many other yogas like ‘Mantra Yoga’, then ‘Hare Rama’ and all kinds of things going on. And we have Tantrikas also. Now it is written in the Vedas that, "First you get your Realization ". The ‘vida’. ‘Vida’ means to know on your central nervous system. And also ‘bodha’ which Buddha talked about also means the same. [To the translator]: ‘Bodha’, ‘bodha’.

So in the Vedas, it is written that after you have got your Realization and you have fixed your attention properly, then you should know mantra, yantra and tantra. Now those who are so-called Tantrikas do not know anything about the mechanism [tantra]. Nor they are Realized souls. Some of them are extremely cruel and money-oriented people. And what they do is nothing but what we call as black magic or mesmerism. Or they do brain washing. Everything is to make money. They cannot explain how they mesmerize, because it is not under their control.

But in Sahaja Yoga, everything can be explained scientifically. And you yourself become empowered. There are many false people these days and they say that they can cure. But curing could be a very dangerous thing. They will cure you for the time being, by putting some sort of a dead spirit in you, and again it will revert back and you might fall into a greater trouble.
The other day, I was in Moscow, and so many children came who watched some sort of a television of someone like that, and they paralysis of the brain, they had, their eyes had lost their power, some had become stiff like this, and some children could not even walk.

Every doctor can explain what is Sahaja Yoga. Today, I met so many of eminent scientists and they were also convinced, and all of them got their Realization in the morning. There should be no secrecy, as the "Glasnost", like that, it should be transparent. [To the translator]: Yes, the "Glasnost" is the word.
Translator: Yes, yes Mother, I said like that.

Shri Mataji: So, now forget about other yogas. Our Sahaja Yoga is today for ‘en masse’ evolution. I just wanted to warn you against these dark forces. As soon as you will start having money, all of them will try to crawl. And worst is the TM (Transcendental Meditation), and which is marketing now ‘ayurveda’, Indian Medical System. I met many people from that system who came from that so called TM, who charged lots of money for nonsensical mantras. They were suffering from epilepsy. Even a director of their flying academy, his wife, his child and his deputy director, all suffering from epilepsy. And they all lost all their money, they became bankrupts.

So, they will also tell you that I am the one who is the worst. All of them might say that I am the one who is doing something like black work, they will tell you. Because they never criticize among themselves. As Christ has said that, "The house of Satan will not do against itself ". Because they all reach out doing the same thing.

Now I've told you that there is this All-Pervading Power. And if you can get connected with that All-Pervading Power, then you get your physical, mental, emotional benevolence. Actually, I don't do anything. The light is within you like a candle, and one enlightened candle can enlighten another one. So, it is your own power which connects you to this All-Pervading Power and you get all these benefits spontaneously. Yesterday, there was a lady suffering from multiple sclerosis and she was - she could not even walk or sit properly. So, we raised her Kundalini and corrected her chakras. She got all right. I asked her to get up. So she still remembered that she was sick. I said, "You get up and walk". And she was walking so fast! We all saw her walking so fast, even on the road. So, it's her own power which has cured her.

Because it is a living process, you cannot pay for it. What do we pay to Mother Earth for sprouting the seed and giving us beautiful flowers? But first, the Kundalini has to rise and it has to get fully connected. Some people take time. But because it is all free, they do not take it seriously. But anybody who wants to get cured has to know that it is spontaneous and you cannot pay for it. And you have to little bit have patience with yourself.

This country, I feel, has the greatest potential. If spiritually you evolve, you’ll get all the blessings of this All-Pervading Power. So you become the Spirit and this Power starts flowing through you. You have to experiment it. You will be amazed that if these vibrations are given through agriculture, it can multiply ten times.

There is an agricultural scientist who was an advisor to the UN. He has done experiments and has proved and trees which were dried, due to ecological problems, he saved most of them who were below 60 years, through vibrations. Because all this work is done, everything is done by that divine Power. And once it starts flowing, you bring the whole vitality at your command.

Yesterday, all of you felt the cool breeze, most of you. But you have to be serious about it. You have faith in Me, but you must have faith in yourself. Most of the people only come when I come. But all of you can become great people, if you just have faith in yourself that you can become. You become extremely creative, and very satisfied with yourself, very peaceful. And you become a personality which can do so much for others.

And I said yesterday, that I’ve great hopes from Russia. But be serious in the sense that you have to have faith in yourself, that you all can become great people. You can cure your children. You can cure the children of other people. You can enjoy your life and you can have the best of health, and best of mind. So please have faith in yourself and you come to our programs here which we have for collective workshop. This has to work out. And once you become connected then you start enjoying time. You become extremely, penetratingly sensitive to beauty and to joy. You immediately know who is auspicious, who is not auspicious. You know who is benevolent for you and who is not. And such a balance is established within you that you never go to the extremes to get to diseases and to get to problems.

Today is the last day of this year, when I'm in Leningrad. I'll be back again next year, definitely. But I would request you to develop yourself into great masters of Sahaja Yoga. Today we have got photographs for you to be distributed in the hall, outside, after the program. But you must know how to use it. Unless and until you know about it, how will you manage it? So please, try to have some time for your spiritual growth, which is the most important. You have to save the whole world, and that is why we have to be well equipped. I can only go to few cities in Russia. I can't go to small villages and to other cities in Russia. So, you have to look after your fellow men here. And you will then have to go all over the world to help the people. So, please, respect your Self-realization. I'm sure the blessings of this All-pervading Power will convince you that you are very glorious, great people.
Thank you very much.

[Applause]

Now we will have a session of Self-realization. [Inaudible]
Now those who don’t want to have it, please, they can leave this meeting, because it cannot be forced. In your freedom you have to ask for it.

I've tried to cover up most of the questions, and I'm quite good at answering them. But whether you receive the answers or not, is not a guarantee for Kundalini awakening within you. It's a happening which is spontaneous.
So, for the time being, the first condition you forget all your problems and all your past. That means you must not feel guilty. You have to understand that this feeling guilty is just a fashion. After all, you are a human-being and if you make mistakes, what is there to feel guilty about them? Your Kundalini knows everything about you. Let her judge you. Why do you want to judge yourself? I would say, as I love you, please love yourself. And respect yourself because you are a human-being. You are the epitome of all the evolution.

So now, second condition is that you have to forgive everyone without thinking individually but in general. Because you forgive or you don't forgive, you don't do anything. It is a myth. It's falsehood, it is myth. But if you don't forgive, then you unnecessarily go on torturing yourself for another person. Now this center, here it is of Agnya Chakra, as I told you yesterday, gets completely closed like this and you cannot pass through this gate. The Kundalini has to pass through and if you do not forgive, this door will remain like this, closed. So, please, allow it to be opened out by forgiving. If you don't forgive, you'll get very hot breeze coming out of you. Just to say in general that, "I forgive everything ", what does it take? Are you going to miss the chance of Self-realization just because you want to play into the hands of somebody else, by not forgiving? So this is very, very important that you should forgive everyone in general. You'll feel much lighter.

So, there are only two conditions: one is not to feel guilty at all, and another one is to forgive everyone.

Now we have to take the help of the Mother Earth as well as your feet should be little loose. So, you please, take out your shoes, it will help a lot.

Now, there are two energies within us, the left and the right as these people have told you already. One is the power of desire on the left side, and the power of action on the right side, while Kundalini is the power of pure desire.

So now you have to also put your both the feet apart from each other. If you are sitting on the ground, it's alright, there's nothing to be done like that. Now, you have to put your left hand on your lap like this, symbolizing your desire to get Self-realization. Now, you have to put your right hand on your lap like this. And the right hand is to be used for giving nourishment to the various centres only on the left-hand side.

[Aside]: Now, somebody should come up to show. Doctor, can you stand in front?

Dr. Wells will show you how to put your hand on different centres. And afterwards, we'll have to close our eyes and the Kundalini awakening process will start.

So first put your left hand towards Me, on your lap. Sit comfortably, not to bend too much or to go back too much. Now, please put your hand first on your heart. In the heart resides the Spirit and the seat of the Spirit is in the fontanel bone area, where it was a soft bone in your childhood.

Now, please take your hand down to the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side. This is the center of your mastery. You become your own master and you become the master of Sahaja Yoga.

Like yesterday, somebody asked if, "I can get cured of drug addiction?" and we definitely cured. Because you become so powerful that nothing can dominate you. Alcoholism, all these habits also drop off. All right.

Now you put your hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side. This is the center of pure knowledge, which manifests on your central nervous system as you enter into the new awareness through this breakthrough.
For example, if there's a dog or a horse, and you want to take the dog or a horse through a very dirty, narrow road, they will not feel any smell, nothing. But in our evolution, we have achieved a sense by which we can feel it. So, when you become a Self-realised person, you start manifesting the knowledge or the cells or sensitivity to something that is wrong and destructive for you. You get a complete, total understanding of reality and also you can feel the absolute truth. This subject is very subtle and is very penetrating and may be difficult for some people to understand. But after Self-realization, it becomes very easy to understand all this. Because this knowledge manifests on your central nervous system.

Now raise your right hand now again back to your center of your mastery, which is on the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side. So now you have to again raise your hand to your heart. Now take your right hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder and turn your head to your right. This center you catch, when you feel guilty and you develop horrible diseases of the spine like spondylitis and also angina out of a lethargic heart.
So, please, do not feel guilty. I tell you, "You are not guilty at all" and have faith in what I am saying. I know you very well and you are not guilty at all. All right.

Now you take your right hand on top of your forehead across and bend your head. And press it on both the sides as far as possible, you have to stretch your hand. This is the center for asking forgiveness. Now take back your hand on the back side of your head and push back your head as far as possible. This is the center for asking forgiveness from this All-pervading Power of love. This is for your satisfaction. You don't have to feel guilty. You don't have to count your mistakes. Now stretch your hand and stretch your palm fully, and put the center of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area, which was a soft bone in your childhood.

Now please, bent your head as much as you can. Now press it, this scalp, by pushing out your fingers. This is very important. And now move your scalp seven times slowly clockwise, please. Done. That's all we have to do.

[Self-realisation session starts]
Now remember you have to put both the feet apart from each other and your left hand towards Me. You have to sit comfortably, not going too much backwards or forwards. If there is something tight on your waist or on your neck, you can loosen it a little bit. You have to take out your shoes fully. Now put both the feet on the ground.
[Aside]: They have taken out. All right.

Now we close our eyes. But nobody should open the eyes. Keep the eyes closed completely.
Please close your eyes and put your right hand on your heart. Here you have to ask Me a very fundamental question. You may call Me Mother or Shri Mataji.
So please ask the question, three times, "Mother, am I the Spirit?" Now, if you are the Spirit you are your master because you have the light.

So now you put your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side. Here you have to ask another question, "Mother, am I my own master?" Ask three times. I respect your freedom and I cannot force pure knowledge on you. So you have to ask for it.

Now please take down your hand in the lower portion of your abdomen. And here you have to say six times, because this sentence has got six petals, "Mother, please, give me pure knowledge".
Now as soon as you ask for pure knowledge, the Kundalini starts moving.

So, we have to open the higher center with our self-confidence. Again I say to you, you have faith in yourself. So now raise your hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side and press it hard.
[Shri Mataji is now working on the translator. To the translator]: Clearly, again say it clearly.
Here now you have to say with full confidence, ten times, "Mother, I am my own master".

I have already told you that the truth is that you are not this body, you are not this mind, you are not these emotions, you are not these conditionings and not your ego, but you are a pure Spirit. 1:08:09
So now please raise your hand on to your heart, and say with full confidence twelve times, "Mother, I am the Spirit".

This All-pervading Power is the power of knowledge and of love. It is the ocean of compassion, intelligence and blessings. But above all it is the power of forgiveness. So whatever mistakes you make or you commit, so-called sins, they all can be dissolved by this great power of forgiveness.
So now raise your hand on the corner of your neck and your shoulder and turn your head to your right. Here you have to say with full confidence, sixteen times, "Mother, I am not guilty".

I’ve already told you that you must forgive everyone in general. This has to be done, otherwise, the Kundalini cannot enter into the limbic area. So please, believe Me, that whether you forgive or don't forgive you don't do anything. But if you don't forgive, then you play into wrong hands.
So now raise your right hand on top of your forehead across, on both the temples ,you must press. And put down your head as far as possible. And here you have to say from your heart, not how many times, "Mother, I forgive everyone".

Now for your own satisfaction, you have to ask forgiveness from this All-pervading Power. So now please take back your hand on the back side of your head and push it back as far as possible. Here now, without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, just for your satisfaction, you have to ask forgiveness from this All-pervading Power. So please say, "O All-pervading power, please forgive me if I have done any mistakes knowingly or unknowingly". Say it from your heart, not how many times.

Now the last center which is the most important. You stretch your hand fully and put the center of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area.
[To the translator]: Tell them.
Now please put down your head.
Please put down your head and push back your fingers.
Now again, I cannot cross over your freedom, I respect it. I cannot force Self-realization on you. You have to ask for it. So now please start moving your scalp carefully with the pressure, with your head down. Move it seven times clockwise saying, "Mother, please give me my Self-realization". Seven times.

[Shri Mataji blows in the mike]

Now please take down your hands. Open your eyes. Put your hands like this towards Me.
Like this. Now you put the right hand towards Me like this, and bend your head and see for yourself if there's a cool breeze coming out of your head.
Maybe not. It will become cool. You forgive, if you do not forgive it will be hot. Don't keep the hand on your head, a little away. Some people get it much far away.

Now put the left hand towards Me, please. And now put your head down. Again keep the hand away from the head and see for yourself if there's a cool breeze coming out of your head.

Now put your right hand again towards Me, once again and see now, if there's a cool breeze coming out of your head, at the fontanel bone area.

Now please raise both your hands towards the sky and raise your head towards the sky.
Now ask a question three times, "Mother, is this the cool breeze of the All-pervading living Power of love?"
[To the translator]: Living Power.

Now, please to take down your hands. Now watch Me without thinking.

Those who have felt, cool breeze out of their head or in their hands or even a hot breeze, please raise both your hands.
Please raise both your hands.
I bless you from My heart.
You all have got your Self-realisation. Now you have entered into a new life of saintliness.
Now you have to enjoy yourself, sing and dance, be happy. You have achieved what you were seeking. And now only you have to develop yourself.
So, please, remember that you have to develop yourself, and you have to go all out to help others.

I'm sorry I have to go, to leave today, and I could be here for a very short time. And these questions, I won't be able to answer. But if you go to the center, the people will tell you what is to be done.
