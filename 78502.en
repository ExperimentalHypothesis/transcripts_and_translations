[...] about all of them. First of all, is about Hatha Yoga where ‘ha’ and ‘tha’ mean both the channels of left and right side that we use. But those people who practice use only part of the right side. Actually, the book of Hatha Yoga is so big, written by Patanjali thousands of years back. And it was written, very clearly, that there are three aspects into which one has to go. Out of which one bit of it, one of the things is ‘Yama niyama’ means the discipline and the control. Out of which the exercise is a very, very wee part. The rest of the book is about your awakening of Kundalini, by saying what states one receives when the Kundalini rises.

But the way people do this Hatha Yoga is like taking all the medicines indiscriminately. On the contrary, when the Kundalini rises, then we know where is the problem exactly and scientifically, we should know what exercise has to be done. Some people require, very few people require these exercises. And we tell them to do it. But first, the Kundalini has to start rising.

In those ancient times, there were very few seekers, like very few flowers of the tree of life. So, at that time, they had to work out on every center gradually, cleansing it for days together, years together, on very, very few people. Shri Rama's father-in-law was Janaka who gave Realization only to one person in that Yuga, in that period. But today, it is Blossom Time. See, there are so many flowers about to become the fruits.

Moreover Sahaja Yoga, in modern times, the way I have reached it, is this way that first, somehow raise the Kundalini and open this Sahasrara, it’s the last center, so that there is some enlightenment.

Firstly, we have no time, we are busy people in modern times. And also we are rather obstinate, [to the translator] obstinate. That we want to discuss everything mentally. But in this darkness, if you tell something, nobody is listening to Me. Supposing somebody is holding on to a snake, and it is all darkness, and he believes that this snake is a rope. And if you tell that person that, " It’s a snake ", he won't listen till the snake bites him. So, with the Kundalini awakening, there is some light which comes, to begin with, and you can feel the All-pervading Power around you for the first time. In that light, you see what are your problems are, and you solve your own problems, if you know how to solve it. This is the way it will be. This is the way it will working out and once you have solved your problems, you can solve the problems of others.

So, Hatha Yoga, as it is practiced today, is only a money-oriented thing which has nothing to do with reality. Also, it creates lots of physical problems, especially emotional. If you start doing too much of this so-called yoga, you go to the right, and you become very, I should say, extremely dry personality. Such a person can develop a terrible temper. There is no kindness, there is no love. And if you have to meet anyone of such a Hatha Yogi, it’s better with a birch spoon.
[To the translator]: Birch spoon is a spoon that is used for the bulls.

So, then there is another yoga, is like Raja Yoga. I went to California where I saw people, long time back, I saw people with their tongues wagging because their threads were cut. I asked them, "What is happening? " They could not speak. They wrote it down that they started doing Raja Yoga.

Now when the Kundalini has started, it is like the ignition of a car. And as in the car, all mechanical, mechanics or the machine starts working automatically, all your machine inside also starts working. And when the Kundalini rises, first the chakras open and then they close, to keep it out there. But when it reaches here [base of the neck], then your tongue, little bit is pulled inside to close this chakra, to keep the Kundalini higher up. But you don't feel anything when it happens, it's so smooth.
Now they had cut the threads of their tongues to put the tongue back for this thing, it’s called as ‘Khechari’. But when Kundalini rises, automatically this ‘Khechari’ takes place. You don't have to do artificial things. It would be like, before starting the car, you start moving the wheels. Will the car move?

Then another one is called as the ‘Integral Yoga of Aurobindo’. It is just talk, talk, talk, talk, talk. Books after books, of all kinds of nonsense, giving no knowledge of reality. That is the reason I have not yet written any book. Because reading cannot take you to reality. Like, in the scripture, it is written that you take your second birth. So now you go on, just that's a prescription, you go on reading, you take your second birth, you take your second birth. So if you have a headache and I tell you that, "Please take this medicine ", write it down the medicine, you go on reading the name of the medicine. Will your headache go or increase?

Then we have so many other yogas like ‘Mantra Yoga’, then ‘Hare Rama’ and all kinds of things going on. And we have Tantrikas also. Now it is written in the Vedas that, "First you get your Realization ". The ‘vida’. ‘Vida’ means to know on your central nervous system. And also ‘bodha’ which Buddha talked about also means the same. [To the translator]: ‘Bodha’, ‘bodha’.

So in the Vedas, it is written that after you have got your Realization and you have fixed your attention properly, then you should know mantra, yantra and tantra. Now those who are so-called Tantrikas do not know anything about the mechanism [tantra]. Nor they are Realized souls. Some of them are extremely cruel and money-oriented people. And what they do is nothing but what we call as black magic or mesmerism. Or they do brain washing. Everything is to make money. They cannot explain how they mesmerize, because it is not under their control.

But in Sahaja Yoga, everything can be explained scientifically. And you yourself become empowered. There are many false people these days and they say that they can cure. But curing could be a very dangerous thing. They will cure you for the time being, by putting some sort of a dead spirit in you, and again it will revert back and you might fall into a greater trouble.
The other day, I was in Moscow, and so many children came who watched some sort of a television of someone like that, and they paralysis of the brain, they had, their eyes had lost their power, some had become stiff like this, and some children could not even walk.

Every doctor can explain what is Sahaja Yoga. Today, I met so many of eminent scientists and they were also convinced, and all of them got their Realization in the morning. There should be no secrecy, as the "Glasnost", like that, it should be transparent. [To the translator]: Yes, the "Glasnost" is the word.
Translator: Yes, yes Mother, I said like that.

Shri Mataji: So, now forget about other yogas. Our Sahaja Yoga is today for ‘en masse’ evolution. I just wanted to warn you against these dark forces. As soon as you will start having money, all of them will try to crawl. And worst is the TM, and which is marketing now ‘ayurveda’, Indian Medical System. I met many people from that system who came from that so called TM, who charged lots of money for nonsensical mantras. They were suffering from epilepsy. Even a director of their flying academy, his wife, his child and his deputy director, all suffering from epilepsy. And they all lost all their money, they became bankrupts.

So, they will also tell you that I am the one who is the worst. All of them might say that I am the one who is doing something like black work, they will tell you. Because they never criticize among themselves. As Christ has said that, "The house of Satan will not do against itself ". Because they all reach out doing the same thing.

Now I've told you that there is this All-Pervading Power. And if you can get connected with that All-Pervading Power, then you get your physical, mental, emotional benevolence. Actually, I don't do anything. The light is within you like a candle, and one enlightened candle can enlighten another one. So, it is your own power which connects you to this All-Pervading Power and you get all these benefits spontaneously. Yesterday, there was a lady suffering from multiple sclerosis and she was - she could not even walk or sit properly. So, we raised her Kundalini and corrected her chakras. She got all right. I asked her to get up. So she still remembered that she was sick. I said, "You get up and walk". And she was walking so fast! We all saw her walking so fast, even on the road. So, it's her own power which has cured her.

Because it is a living process, you cannot pay for it. What do we pay to Mother Earth for sprouting the seed and giving us beautiful flowers? But first, the Kundalini has to rise and it has to get fully connected. Some people take time. But because it is all free, they do not take it seriously. But anybody who wants to get cured has to know that it is spontaneous and you cannot pay for it. And you have to little bit have patience with yourself.

This country, I feel, has the greatest potential. If spiritually you evolve, you’ll get all the blessings of this All-Pervading Power. So you become the Spirit and this Power starts flowing through you. You have to experiment it. You will be amazed that if these vibrations are given through agriculture, it can multiply ten times.
