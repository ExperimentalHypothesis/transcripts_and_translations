[Poor audio quality. There is constant sound of hammer and nails in the background throughout Shri Mataji’s speech. As a result the recording is unclear in several places].

Before we do our program in this regard I want to tell you something. So all of you should listen to it peacefully and imbibe it. The thing that I have to tell you is that you all are watching that there are many people in Sahaja Yoga, especially in Delhi. And many have become good Sahaja Yogis. The message I had given was that we have to grow both vertical and horizontal brains in the same way. That is you should pay more attention to this. We must be alert. Because we are very much responsible. The whole world is watching us today. Where have we have reached. What have we attained. And after that there is another responsibility that what can we give. If there is no balance and purity in our life, in our behavior, in our speech, in our life; then we cannot attract anyone. Therefore it is very important to bring that purity in us and it is also important to understand that. And all the conditionings that we have had so far, we should also look at them completely and as you watch it, it will burn itself and then what. So we will see within ourselves. Whether you look inside, or you see outside. Those things will break, which are useless, will disappear. That which is against our progress will be destroyed.

Therefore our eyes should be upon ourselves, and we should see makes us wait and we should see how we are moving in balance within and without. In reality, in Sahaja Yoga, you plant a seed. The moment the seed sprouts, you move towards it within. And there also it another sprout appears. And grows on its own. So that seedling does not even have to think about how we are growing. How are we heading towards the sun? At that time, the subtle knowledge is enclosed within it. The way the plant grows in the sun. How does it take sustenance from the sun? How its takes its sustenance and uses it completely and throws it away. Its whole [unclear/lifecycle] is planned out. In which way its leaves fall in cold season and its leaves are absorbed in the earth element. And then it also knows that this falling of leaves is also important. There is nothing bad in it. it. ‘The leaves fallen on the ground will get a kind of nitrogen from the leaves and I will grow from it.’ All this understanding is bound inside it, whether it is plant life, or creature or animal, they are all in the ‘pasha’ (bondage) of God Almighty. The divine intelligence is bound within it, and it works on its own. And there is no need to explain it to them. They understand themselves.

In this way we have to grow, in which way we have to move forward And in the same way, we have to go to what height. Just like a mango tree will go to its height. All of you will see this if you look towards nature. These all happen on their own. If you go to a forest, you will not smell anywhere, you will not see any dirt. As soon as a man reaches there, you will come to know that here lives a man. Because if he is a human, there will be dirt, there will be damage. And the other species do not have it. Because they are bound by the laws of God. And their intelligence works by Chaitanya (all-pervading Power) and so they do not have any questions. It is not a question for them; can they do this work or not. Whether they should or should not. Because they do not even have the idea of sin or virtue in them. There is no ego within them that ‘we are doing this work’.  They do not think of sin and virtue. There is no thought within them that this good or bad – no dilemma in them.

Which seed you sow the same flower will blossom from it. Whatever fruit it is, the same fruit will come out. And grows completely on its own and will continue to grow and accepts as a work for God. It will have no objection, no thought, no uncertainty whether to do it or not. Is it going to be good or bad? Will it serve my interest? Will I benefit from it? They don't see it for their own benefit and nor for anything else. The protection God has given to them. Like the [unclear] who God has given such a colour that they are protected. He has made them in such a way that they have His protection. And they accept everything.

If there will be a lion in the forest. If there will be a lion in the forest. So he will be the king. If he is a king, then he believes that he is the king. So how to accept he is the king? because it is written in God’s laws that the lion is the king of the forest. Because the lion is the king of the forest, he kills one animal, so no one will touch that animal. Because that is the king's food. No one, not even a bird, touches it. When the king eats it after twenty-fous hours, the small creatures and birds will eat it. Then the smaller creature will eat it.  And after that, some other small animals will eat it. Their rules are made. There is no big or small in them, no disputes. All of them systematically eat that animal.

But when the same lion kills any animal, there is terror. If you go to that forest, then there will be a kind of peace. So it would seem that everyone is afraid of him. If the lion is sitting anywhere, even a bird will not chirp. Not even a bird. Now Rajasaheb (lion) is sitting now, just sit quietly and sleep. If he is snoring and sleeping, even the birds are quiet. In this way you come to know that the lion is around.  And the lion also remains calm because he also has to kill only one animal that too once in fifteen days. He does not kill animals every day. Do not eat someone else's kill. Do not do foul play.

A scorpion lives like a scorpion, snake lives like snake and lion lives like lion. In us scorpion, snakes, lions – do not know [unclear] have come out. The reason is that God Almighty has given us freedom. God Almighty said, do what you want to do. Live as you want to live Use your freedom and see. First see if you understand your freedom. See what freedom you have. Now in that freedom we get an attitude that, ‘I am doing this, doing that’. And then the idea of sin and virtue comes. Conditionings also come in. Like this thing is good; this thing is bad. Whatever anyone says. For example someone says, ‘You are Hindustani.’ [unclear] will beat him up.

So this freedom that was given to humans by God Almighty was given so that, in that freedom you know God Almighty. And with this freedom, you find the freedom where you attain “swa-tantra” (the Spirit). ‘Swa-tantra’ means you come to know your own tantra (mechanism/working), the tantra of the Atma. Because those who do not have freedom, what more can they achieve?  When you go to school, you are first taught that two plus two is four. For next five, six years you learn with a stick behind you. When you go to college, you have freedom. You go ahead using your brains. In the same way, God has given you this freedom.

Now I have given you even more freedom. You have come into the light of the Spirit so for Me, you are saints. You have risen and become yogis. And yogis are always worshipped. [unclear]. The only difference is that earlier yogis would work hard, do a lot of cleansing and there would be one yogis among hundreds of thousands. Not everyone could give realisation. I have given realisation to thousands. This has become a flaw in Sahaja Yoga. Due to this, a lot of things are still stuck within us. And due to these things that are stuck, of a gross nature, a lot of questions arise.

That's why I gave you a message and have made you understand what is happening inside us and what is happening outside. Those who have now understood this thing, they can fully pay more attention to themselves And can find out what is inside them and what is outside of them. Sahaja Yoga is of course, a thing of great joy. [unclear] But this does not mean that you get that joy for a second. You have to have it forever. And for this you have to go deep into it. Now I have never talked about anything, that you should be organized in some way. Or teel you that you should do this or do that; I never talked about itI. All of you look towards Me. We have seen all the steep slopes.

So it is important that I like to tell you something about this now about how should we organize ourselves. So, absolutely we should get down to [unclear]. That we are human beings, and we have the freedom of human beings. And because of this sometimes we do such things that are not worthy of yogis. I have a one request you that, whenever you have to do any work for Sahaja Yoga, our you want to do special work for Sahaja Yoga. So I have made an introduction that I will read here right now. So you can do this without asking Me. Maybe you are a big scholar, may have [unclear]. As you have a wish to do a lot of work. You may feel you should go and really work very hard. [unclear]. What you have, wherever you go the work is going to start. That's why many people say that let's go. Ok get it done. Should not be like this. Everyone should know. This should be put forward to everyone that you want to do this work and whether you have their permission. And you don't have to do anything more than that. if they say no then no and if they says yes then yes.

So what will happen if they refuse, then you can ask them there too. “This is what we think about it. What do you think; are we doing right or wrong.” So there will be a mutual understanding. So yogis should have sense and understanding. What is good and what will increase the name of Sahaja Yoga. Now someone says that you dance in the name of Sahaja yoga on the road. Alright, dance. But not here. Not in Delhi. You can dance in Maharashtra. but not here. People here will not understand. They will think what kind of crazy people you are. Do not behave like this here. This kind of understanding and knowledge can all come to you if you just look at it subtlety. Just look at with your subtle feeling. So you can understand what to do for Sahaja Yoga. From which things, I will increase the name of Sahaja Yoga. How I will increase the service of Sahaja Yoga. And how can I balance it within myself?

So I have thought that our Shri Dr. Talwar and Shri Venugopalji have done a lot of work here. And I congratulate for them for their work. The way they handled the work till date. They have worked very hard and very wisely. They get all the work done. And now I have thought that now some general people should be given this work. And for that, those people also want to be given some other work. So that they can also turn their attention within themselves more. So I told the doctor that whenever you have to go out or when you give lectures - after the public program when people mediate – after that you also have to do meditation. Like Ram in Ramlila. [break in recording]

[unclear]. In public program prachar must be there. [unclear/meditation]. At least ten minutes. And aarti must be done. Aarti should never be missed no matter what happens. Do not waste time in unnecessary things. Do not tell anyone about yourself. Do not tell your experiences. If you have some experience, then write it down and give it. We will all get Compiled. Anyone had some experience, some miracle happened, if there was some good outcome, then give it to them by writing and also give your questions by writing. And they will be compiled. For this we will put some people, that they will do this work and this work.

Like I heard a small thing that electricity money was not given. Those who take the lecture will see; they should be ready for public lecture. They should be taught. Venugopalan and his wife these people always put an idea in My mind that we can bring Chaitanya in some form in our country. You can bring it in the form of a creative skill or talent. In the form of drama, in the form of art, [unclear]. The second way is that, in London and other foreign countries, they hold exhibitions. In it, nice paintings made by children and adults. And part from that they have made, now, it can be said that what Abraham Lincoln said and what he said and what he said. And his pictures and paintings. And what William Blake said. So it is made like this about Sahaja Yoga. And it is very interesting.

And in the same way, your own experiences, can write about that. Any special experience you had, you can write about that. That I experienced this. Or if there is any special news, can write about that. These kind of topics should be created. Similarly that are photographs of Mine, which you have, that have great miracles in them. And lots of lights etc can been seen. Now there is one where all of My Sahasrara can be seen. You can display all those. So by having this type of system in place, in one way people will get to see that Sahaja Yoga is definitely [unclear]. [unclear] if this thing comes in front of them, people will be very happy. You can have this type of exhibition.

Here there are many such people. Brahmakumari they hold some nonsensical exhibition and people come to see them. So wherever there is an exhibition you can take some space there and (have an exhibit) for Sahaja Yoga. Preparation has to be made for this. And for children also to learn classical well, keep a good classical teacher.  And who can teach them. Or someone who can teach good classical dances [unclear]. With this the innate talent within children [unclear].

In Australia when I went recently, they had made little cup saucers with their own hands. That way you can better things in the market; no doubt about it. But I get very happy by things that you make by hand. In the ashram these things are; this one was made by this person; this one was made by this person. That way ladies can make; also think about it, what can we make. Similarly what kinds of different types of food items that should be thought out.

Now whenever we have something, there is catering – I have seen this everywhere. Wherever I go, there is catering.  And I say that whenever you go for a picnic, go out then the ladies should make the food. There are many dishes that can be made, and we are collecting recipes for them. There is yogi in Bombay who is collecting all the dishes and getting a book printed. He also showed Me that it is going to be like this. Like this you can think of so many things. Women can do a lot of work. By doing this kind of work your sense of collectivity will grow, everyone will come together, [unclear] and if everyone works together the work will be done properly. Decoration work, or any other work, all of it I have seen just as this thing is or that (points to the decoration) – each and every thing they make and place it. On their behalf. No one gets from the market. Nothing. Everything of theirs is created or made. Now this Ganpati there can be made; no need to get it from the market. In this manner, each and everything is made and kept there and there is a feeling of joy.  I look at it and even in small, small things the love flows out.

Now Easter is coming. At Easter they make the eggs. All of them decorate the eggs with their hands. So many eggs, so beautiful and [unclear]. And in this manner they are all kept in the ashram. It looks very beautiful. [possible break in recording]. [unclear] in India.  Discuss with one another – which art form is alright, what book should be read, what book is good, what is written in it Have some [unclear/critical appreciation?].  Don’t stay within your limits. Expand your limits.

And men should also know about their country. We do not know anything about our country. [unclear] that is why we love our country so much.  Our country is very deep and profound. And apart from this, it has many [unclear]. Infinite [unclear]. We are in the dark about it. And that should not happen. We should tell our children. What types of songs there are and all. And your intellect will become so dynamic. Because you have the light within you now. You are no longer ordinary. If you have some machinery and do not use it; it is like that. So I have told Doctor [Nigam/Nikam?] that you [unclear] here. We are doing this for you. And if you have any complaint, any problem then you let him know. You can tell him about anything.

And we have formed a committee. It is small; not too big. But we have formed it here. One is Mister Nargilkar; where is he? Mister Nargilkar.

Sahaja Yogi: There he is. [Mister Nargilkar stands up and bows down].

Shri Mataji: One [unclear/Hussein]. One [unclear]. One is [unclear/Mister Agarwal], and Mister Datta is there. [unclear] Kohli is there for accounts. [Yogis applaud for every name announced]. And there are one or two gentlemen [unclear].

Sahaja Yogis: Ambavat and Saupreet.

Shri Mataji: Mister Saupreet and Ambavat. I knew this already. [unclear]. And all the in-fighting should go away. If you [unclear/anger] and ‘I am doing it’ then [unclear]. And all you have full understanding and if there is any question, then say it. Do not do anything without asking. No one should do any arbitrary work. It creates lots of problems. ‘I thought should do this; thought should do that’ – it causes big problems. So you kindly take care that any work – the more responsibly it is done; it will be more beneficial. And they will have fewer problems.

The need of today is that we do Sahaja Yoga will wisdom and understanding. Thay way, all of you are My children and I love you very much. And I do not want to say anymore so you [unclear]. But you must understand it is a work of responsibility. If I had made you sweat and toil for thousands of years to raise you up, then [unclear/type of Sahaja Yogis people would think are something].

[Talk resumes at another point].

... I am in Delhi. And work hard here. [Applause]. Is he here?

[Sir C.P. arrives and greets everyone. Sir C.P. addresses the audience, followed by music and bhajans].
