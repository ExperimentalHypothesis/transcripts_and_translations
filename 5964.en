So first of all, I'll have to tell you something about Sahaj Yog, and also about how people get made it up with other things. 


The first and foremost thing one must know that, if there is something genuine, people do attempt to create something fake out of it. It is a fact. [otherwise] one has to accept.


If you have real flowers, then you find all kinds of plastic plants, all kinds of copies of that. In art, it is a very good thing, to copy it. One Goddess create it, and also to add to it your own feeling, than your own angles about a particular see. An artist sees much more than a normal man can, a normal impression of any material thing despite gross.


But artist [being] subtler because of his temperament and because of his own sensitivities. He sees much more and deeper things. And he reproduces that, which is created by God, in a better way. Because he exposes those subtleties which a normal human eye cannot see or perceive. As far as material things are concerned, it's a very good attempt, and one should do it. That can really give people a subtler understanding of God's creation.


But as far as the real religion is concerned, you cannot play about with it. You cannot create copies of that because it's a living thing. You cannot create copies of living things, because you cannot create life. You can make it life-like, but it cannot be a living thing. Religion is a living thing within us. It is the sustenance within us which starts flowering from the very beginning of life where life changes, transforms, from one single-cellular animal to this complex human being.


You cannot show that transformation, by making a painting out of it. Because as soon as the human being touches the thing, it is dead. You can show a smiling flower. You can show at the most the mobile smile of Mona Lisa. That's also you make sometimes. But you cannot show Mona Lisa who is smiling all the time or changing her forms.


And that is why it is important to understand that when people try to copy the real religion within you, they make a good job out of it. They have to make it so good, that people should not be deceived any more. This has been our problem since long.


Christ was real, Shri Krishna was real. But those who tried to copy him, did a good job out of it but still it was not real. And that is why whenever any such attempts are made. You find that it is very confusing for a person to make out real from unreal.


I've been facing this problem since I went to America in 1970. When I went to America in 1970, there were people who came out with their tape recorders and they have very complicated machineries. They taped Me, and they taped whatever I was telling them. And some of the people who were organizing My program took an objection to it. And they said: "Mother, they should not tape it." I said, "Why not? Let them tape it, it is vibrations, why are you afraid?" They said: "They'll make a copy out of it." I said, "Let them make a copy. By making a copy they cannot make Me out of that. Or they cannot make you out of that. They cannot raise the kundalini of people, they cannot give them self-realization. When it comes to a charity, they cannot do it. What do they do? At the most they'll talk." 


So there was a book, written as "New Awareness" in which words vibrations and all those things I have said was used. And they sent Me a copy of the book saying that, "This is what has happened out of You." And there were many people who started talking about these things, new dimension, new awareness, all those things. And they also started claiming that they can raise Kundalini.


Up to that point, people can tell lies. Human beings have a special capacity to tell lies. I think nobody, no creation of God is that good at telling lies as human beings are. And without understanding that you will be tested, you will be find out, without any fear about it.

They are making copies of it because they can make some money out of it perhaps. Maybe because of that, they can have some sort of advertising advantage, or some sort of a material, baser advantage they will get out of it. So I have to accept it. I said all right, all right, doesn't matter. But when it comes to actually giving realization they're nowhere. They find out also other methods of making it look very attractive. First of all, it's a money-making proposition. Once you start making money, you can spend also. On advertising, having a big circus about it. Talking in a way that would look extremely fantastic. Even they got recognition by governments, some of them have earned millions of Pounds and billions of dollars. But then, one has to know that the mistake lies not only with them, but also with the people who are seeking the truth.


And I have said before and many a times, modern times are the blossoming time. This is the time when we are going to become the fruits. This is the time of real transformation, this is the time of real baptism. This is the time when you are going to know yourself. The time has come, it's the maturity that is important for life. 


You have seen that in this human body, if we inject anything, it is thrown out. If you try to push anything into this body which is a foreign material which cannot be absorbed by this body, it's thrown out. But if you see a fetus, it is not thrown out. Not only that, but it is matured, looked after, loved, and at the right maturity, it comes out at the right time. 


In the same way, the development of spiritual ripening had to reach a certain maturity in the human beings to get to this breakthrough. Think of Christ, only about 2000 years back. Do you think we could have got them for such a communication, people who are really seekers, who are seeking ? They were people who never knew about God. They were people [that] did not know that there was something divine. It was Christ who had to introduce this idea. In those days, in this England, what was the situation of awareness? People were fighting with the cold and all the winds that were blowing over this island. They had no idea at all that there was God, on the contrary if they had anything, they used to think why so cruel a God.


This awareness had to mature up to a point, come up to a point, and then this was to happen. It is in life, you have seen, everything has to mature. If you sow the seed and say tomorrow I must get the fruit you are not going to get it. But if you see the whole span of life, it is a very, very short time. Even the time from when the earth succeeded from the sun. And all that light, came into existence, then it become a human being itself is a big miracle. It could not allowed in such a short time than nobody can believe that it can be a thing of chance. On this point all scientists are agree that in mathematical calculation, if you use the law of chance, it does not explain at all that in such a short time human beings could be created. But as human beings are, when they are scientists, they refuse to accept anything beyond.


One side we have people, scientists who do not want to accept anything beyond the gross. The other side we have people who see something from the beyond and believe that it is spiritual -which is not. Anything that is beyond the gross, may not be spiritual, need not be the real, it could be something else, which you have not yet seen. So, under this circumstances of confusion the cunning takes birth on this earth and they find out ways and methods of exploiting. Some of them are not canny, they genuinely believe they can help people and some of them are absolutely naive, and they start this work with that naivity. Start getting little money out of it, or some sort of a recognition and then they find that it's a good method of floating an enterprise, and they do it. 


But for this, we have so many ways of understanding what is the real. We have so many scriptures, which are true. That true or not, at least should be verified. Once you discard some theories or any hypothesis, you must know that you are not given proper respect and understanding of that. How can you disregard something which you have not read, which you have not seen? So that's how it works out and people start producing things which are fake.


Today, why I'm going to speak about it, because I had lots of questions, that people said, that many people come with the same ideas that you are saying. They are claiming the same thing, and what is the difference between Sahaja Yoga and other things.


In one sentence, I can say, Sahaja Yoga is the actualization of the experience of selfhood. While others are just talking, talking, talking, talk. Now it is said, not only in India. Christ not being an [Englishman or enmeshment], I would say he didn't say it in English. But when I, see your Stonehenge, I know there were people who were working on Kundalini. But the other day I met a lady who was telling Me that now scientifically it has been proved that Stonehenge has no meaning. Now I said, how can they understand what is a Stonehenge [is], how will they understand because their awareness at this point is gross. By science you cannot understand Stonehenge, for that you have to have that new awareness by which you can feel the vibratory awareness within you, the radiation of the self.


How it happens? In the Bible it is written that I will appear before you like tongues of flames. There are many sentences like that. Now can you explain to Me what are those tongues of flames are? Because those who are also reading their Bible, are just reading the words. By reading the words, you can at the most say tongues of flames means this, that, anything they can put, but actually you have not seen. So it's all a guesswork and imagination. That's why there are so many groups, so many religious organizations, so many Gods, so many up [everything]. But, if you have seen it, then you will know what it means. You have seen this hall, so you know what this hall means. But if you have not been inside this, what's the use of talking about it, when you have not been there. But it is another common human failing that one tries to do it.


As all the incarnations, and all the great prophets, and all the realized souls were very simple people. Perhaps I have had the greatest human realization among all of them, I have understood human beings much better than they have understood. Because they were born at such a level that they could not see what a human mind works with. They cannot understand because at that level you have no temptations, you don't know why should anybody tell lies, you don't know why you should copy, why you should try to be nasty. 


So many times I feel that way that when I hear people talking ill of others or anything, I say that, "I've no time sufficient to love and where is the time to sit down and to think of all these nonsensical things?" But human beings can be very nonsensical, this perhaps none of the incarnations ever realized. I had to come to understand it, I believe. And after understanding human beings, I felt that the timegap was too much. And that's how they started groping here and there and did all kinds of things. And, in the meanwhile, this cunning has profited itself. 


So first you just raise your attention a little higher and think from there that, "How can you purchase God in a market ? How can you pay for an experience which is your own transformation, which comes through life ? How can anyone who says he's a holy man can be a parasite? How can anyone who is supposed to be giving you religion, who'll depend on you for his living? How can you organize God and how can you organize that living religion?" A simple question one should ask, I think, before going into these things. And once you start asking such questions to yourself, you will be able to say like in Sanskrit it is said: "[Sanskrit words ending in:] neti neti". 


By saying not this, not this, not this, you reach the truth. But then when the truth's also comes you say then not this. Like our American friends who are doing nowadays Guru shopping. They also start saying not this, not his, not this, trust, they're jumping into it headlong, get a big bump. Then they go to another one have another bump there. By the time they are absolutely fagged out. They came up to Sahaja Yoga and they say, "Not this too." It is an interesting thing, how human being are going to miss the Truth.


What is the truth? Truth is that you are created specially, you are chosen specially, to enter into the kingdom of God, to maneuver His power, to get all His blessings and all His enjoyment, because He is your father God Almighty who loves you. This is the fact and the truth and unless and until somebody gives you that, you are not to believe into anyone. This headlong plunge cannot be explained except when we have to accept that we had some sort of a weakness, or a some sort of a hallucination or mesmerized mind that we got into this nonsense.


Now for Sahaja Yoga, it has been written thousand of years back, not today. That in the human being is placed in the sacrum bone is a residual power called as Kundalini which awakens and gives you your second birth. This is what Christ has said, "You are to be born again." You are to be born again, not your father, not your children. It is you who has to be born again, means when you are living you will be twice-born. In your own human awareness you must get this experience. Unless and until you have that experience, you are not to believe into any nonsense that's going on. Especially if it is selling. If you give up only one point that nobody can take money for this experience 99.9 % people will drop out. One person may be there, who might be wanting some sort of a recognition or some thing, they might be doing it, and might be telling stories that I'm a big [fat tree or attractive] or some thing like that. All that you have to see what are they giving you.


When this Kundalini rises, you have seen here in the triangular bone, she is placed - three and a half coils. She exists there as a living thing. It's a living energy which differs in different people, the color is something you can say like a tubelight in a person who is a very awakened person. But depends on what sort of a person it is. In the people who are extremely gross, this Kundalini looks like mud put together. In some people, it looks a whitish mud. It has different colors and different illuminations according to the human being. 


Now you cannot see it, I agree. But you can see the pulsation of this kundalini. When you see some people, coming over here, now most of them have seen, and who are giving, who are given realization. You can see their pulsation on their backs; you can see that part of the bone, sacred bone which is sacred because it is sacred. Why is it sacred? This bone does not burn. If the whole body is burnt out also, this bone cannot be burnt. See people, this word had come from Greek Land had recognized that this bone is the sacred bone and that's why they called it as sacred. This bone in us contains this energy, which you can see with your naked eyes in the bone it is pulsating, you can see it very clearly.


Now, one can see there, that this nobody can do. This pulsation, nobody can do. People make you jump, dance, shout, shriek, wear dresses, wear uniforms - do all kinds of nonsensical things. But they cannot make this bone pulsate. And when the bone pulsates, it rises. The whole rising of pulsation you can see it, and with a stethoscope you can hear it till it reaches the fontanel bone area where also you can hear that pulsation just like your heart pulsation.


Recently, very recently I should say Kabira has lived. He was a great poet and a great Sahaja Yogi, he has sung the praise of Sahaja Yoga. He says "Shunya shikhara par anahata baje". He says all this silent peace of the head, "Anahada" means the sound without percussion, this lubdub lubdup. You can hear that. And when it becomes silent, then you have got your realization. At that very moment, you start feeling the cool breeze coming towards you, if I'm there, but if I'm not there, it is going out of you. Now this cool breeze like flowing is the radiation of the self. This radiation passes through your body, just like my voice is passing through this (mike). And you can actually feel it. Whatever you can feel is the real. Whatever you can see is the real, whatever you can hear is the real. You can feel it flowing from your hands. Now I must say also that it doesn't happen to everyone.


Like every flower may not become a fruit but it happens to many of them and if you say, the time factor it acts on many people at the same time. But even once second here, two minutes here, later or early it's something like flowers turning into fruits. That's also a slower process still but Sahaja Yoga process can work out you can say within half an hour even thousand people can get realization. 


Now it is also written that it is very difficult but it is also written when the time will come it will happen en-masse. It is a difficult thing, no doubt, it is a very difficult thing for human beings to take out the (?) or the germinating power out of the seed. You cannot pull it out to become a tree. Whatsoever you may try, you can stand on your head. Do whatever you please, you cannot germinate. It has to happen spontaneously. Whatever has to happen spontaneously, you cannot labor for it. You cannot work for it, it just happens. What works out you think, in a seed what works out. The germination! The seed is a built-in tree. It's all placed in there. It is all placed within you. The whole thing is placed in you, the evolutionary process. All these centers are your evolutionary steps, one by one, are the milestones in your progress. It is all placed within you. Because it's a living process it only acts to that which is living. 


Like water has to be poured onto the seed, but it has to be water say if you put plastic or kerosene oil it won't sprout. In the same way one has to pour the divine love which one has to get passing through you, that divine power which is called as Brahma within you. This all-pervading divine power which you cannot feel normally has to be little bit poured into you. And somebody who can do it can sprout the Kundalini and Kundalini is awakened and you get your self-realization.


Now how are we to believe that it is self-realization? It happens to people in such a way. Yes, we have felt the cool breeze, all right. We're feeling very relaxed, all right but still how is it a self-realization? Such questions must be known beforehand, what are we expecting out of it? That I said that it is a new awareness, new dimension in your awareness. So how do you get the new awareness, the awareness of the self, how do you get it? The awareness of the human beings you have got. But awareness of the self, if you're getting how will you find out? 


First of all self is that subtle instrument within you as shown. You start feeling on your fingers all your subtle centers which are controlling the sympathetic nervous system. Here you can see the colors as shown clearly. These colors are related to the chakras that are within you, the subtle centers. These subtle centers control the gross plexuses within us. So you start feeling them, this is actualization.


For a person, who is a very devoted, dedicated, simple Indian, say he is in India. He is laughing enjoying the joy, I've found it, I've found it he goes on. And for an intellectual say in England, he first starts verifying, analyzing what he has got here. He doesn't accept the joy part of it because his heart is closed. So he starts finding out what is in this center, what is in this center, what is in this center. 


By this happening what you get first and foremost is your physical fitness. You are physically completely cured through Sahajyog. For example cancer is a disease which is a modern disease. We're exhausting all our energies and that is why we are getting cancer. Cancer can only be cured by Sahajyog and I have cured cancer and many of the Sahajyogis have been cured of cancer, of leukemia.


What happens and how it works out we'll need another lecture, But if you can read one of My pamphlets which I spoke to the medical institute in India. Most of the diseases can be cured through Sahajyog. Except if you remove the bone, it cannot create but all the repairing work can be done through Sahajyog. But once you get your realization you are amazed that you start curing people. Mental diseases can be easily cured by Sahajyog. You see this is like giving (?) chocolate, unless and until you do not tell them some material benefit people are not going to listen to you. As soon as you tell them your diseases can be cured they pray, they start listening. If you say your mental troubles will be over they say all right, listen to this. Now we have people here who have had mental troubles, they are all being cured of their mental troubles. They are leading a very normal life. This is the minimum that can happen to you.


The third chocolate is that your material life improves, you have a center there just in the center where you see there is a light in gold that's the place if it is under any trouble then you have your financial problems. It's a very subtle thing why we have our financial problems but you do not become a multi-millionaire with Sahaja Yoga, no! That's another problem. Sahajyog does not give you headaches, it gives you sufficient to be satisfied, to be generous, to be good. First of all it cures...
