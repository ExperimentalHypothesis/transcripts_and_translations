I bow to all seekers of truth.

At the very outset, we have to know that truth is what it is. We cannot change it. We cannot describe it and unfortunately at this human awareness you cannot know it. Truth has been, is and will be. Whatever I am going to tell you today, please know that it is absolutely tangible, and have no blind faith about it.This blind faith has created so many problems in this world you know very well. So if you find whatever I am saying is the truth and you experience it, then as earnest people you are to believe it, because it is for your benevolence. For the benevolence of your family. For the benevolence of your city, for the benevolence of your country, for the benevolence of the whole world. So now the time has come to think of our benevolence. As you know in America, it is quite shocking the way things are moving in the name of freedom. People are destroying themselves. Destroying their societies. Destroying their family life and all kinds of problems, of such a deep varieties that we have to now look into it and find out what's wrong. What's wrong, where are we going? What are we supposed to do? Now the truth is that you are not this body, this mind, these emotions, this intellect, your conditionings or your ego. For all this, you say 'my.' This is my ego, this is my emotions but who is the owner of this 'my', you should find out. This is the first truth that in your evolutionary process you have not achieved that state where you can know absolute truth. If everybody knows the absolute truth there cannot be discussions, arguments, fightings and wars, because everybody sees the same point. The second truth is as we see around us such beautiful flowers here, we take them for granted.And if you ask a doctor who runs your heart he will say it is the autonomous nervous system. But who is this auto? That they can't answer. So the second truth is that there is all-pervading power of divine love which does all these living things, spontaneously, and we do not want to know about it and we don't know how it works. So these are the two things one has to find out. It's very easy to feel this all-pervading power of divine love.We all will feel it tonight. I am sure you all will feel it tonight and it is your right to know it because you have reached the state now of a human awareness which is in quite a turmoil. And is already said that in this modern times at the end of it people will be so disturbed that they will seek the truth.But when the seeking started people really were misled very much. I am surprised how people accepted all these things which obviously are absolutely nonsense. And absolutely false. First of all, how can you pay for your spiritual life? God doesn't understand money. Banking is your headache.He doesn't understand. How can you pay for it?But people have paid so much of money for nonsense. I am surprised what happens to their understanding about reality. First of all, we have to know that it is not a mumbo- jumbo. Is not something where human beings can just work it out by changing the dress or by chanting something.It is not possible. Something has to happen within yourself. And for that, you are already built. Already have all the centres within you. Only thing is this Kundalini has to be awakened which is in the sacrum bone that means the Greeks knew it is sacred.It is all there, just like you take a seed and put into mothers womb it sprouts. Because it is built-in. In the seed that it can be sprouted and also in the mother earth that it can sprout it.It is so spontaneous.Sahaja.Sa means with, ja means born. Born with you, is the right to have this yoga. Means is union with the all-pervading power of divine love. IT is called by various names for example in the Bible is called the cool Breeze of the Holy Ghost.It is called in the Quran as Ruh. In the Sanskrit language, it is called Parama Chaitanya. Patanjali has called as Uthammaha Pragnya and there are various names, whatever name you may call it. But it is true that it exists and we have to feel it.Thus we have to achieve our enlightenment. I am sorry for being late, but I must tell you this, America is so full of problems where ever you have to go we should take the house near it and live there near it otherwise we cannot reach but I am sorry and I am very thankful that you waited. Shows that you are really desirous of having your self-knowledge your Self -realisation. So I would not tell you about these stupid people mostly came from India and from here to make money out of you. You all have experienced it. Recently somebody told me from Washington that he lost all his money, everything.His children have been taken away from the school.He has to sell off the house.I said, for what?There is this one gentleman from Kyiv who is very clever. I went to his meeting and he called another fellow on the stage and he said see I can control his mind and I will tell you how you can control others mind. Why do you want to do that? And then he said, now see, he will move the pendulum. And he started moving the pendulum. And I was so enamoured that I said whatever you do you teach me this. That's how he became bankrupt.But I said, have you no brains to understand? Have you come on this earth to move a pendulum? Another thing they started that you can levitate and can move about at 3 feet height. Imagine. There are no one this people despite that we are having such champs. What's the use of having this 3 feet people going round and round but they did it and I was surprised that their head of their flying Academy came to me. His name is Peter Pears. He told me fantastic things about the stupidity to which people take to.He said I put in all my money.He was a diamond merchant.So my guru told me that  you have to go to America and tell them stories.So first story he told them that I have come here without a visa, without aeroplane just in my meditation.They believed. And then he said that I can pass through the wall and they believed. I said they should have at least asked him to pass through the wall.All such stupid things people have been believing, having been misled, spoiling their chakras.One thing I would like to tell you that your innocence is never, never destroyed because it is eternal.Only there are some clowns.By doing all these nonsensical things also there will be some clowns but it can be easily manifested without any effort and this is a  special time for that. Very special time. I call it the Blossom time but they call it as the last judgement. Islam calls it as Qayamat. Resurrection time, all kinds of words are given to this and a great poet William Blake has said that people of God, he called them 'Gods man', will be born again on this earth at this time and they will achieve their divinity and they will have powers to give divinity to others. This is exactly what is happening in Sahajayoga. Mohammed Saheb in his Quran clearly said that 'at the time of qayamat your hands will speak and they will give( UNCLEAR) meaning witness against you.I will tell you what's wrong with you.' This is exactly what happens in Sahaja yoga. But you know how these things are. It's absurd but how people have taken to something so fundamentally wrong against God.To be fundamentalists itself is against God.God Almighty has created all this world.How can He have different, different religions and how can He have different, different ideas about God. Some say there is one God, some say there is hundred Gods. Some say this. There has to be one singular thing if it is an absolute truth. And that's why in Sahaja yoga when you take to religion you realise that all these religions are like flowers of the same tree of spirituality born at different times. And according to the times these Prophets, and this incarnations all of them have tried to give information about this happening that is going to take place. Now people who have not got enlightenment cannot accept it. They do their own thinking, their own ideas and they make up something which is just a brand. If you are a Hindu or a Christian or a Muslim or anything you can commit any mistakes. You can commit any kind of sin.This is just a brand.These religions are within yourself and unless and until they are enlightened you cannot be a righteous person. Moreover, I must say that Christ, Mohammed Sahab all such  great people who came on this earth were absolutely pure, very high people.They didn't know what sort of human beings they were talking to.They didn't know. Fifth chapter Matthews, if you read, for Christians. Christ has said that if your one eye does something wrong take it out. If your another eye does something wrong take it out. If your one hand right-hand does something wrong cut it. If your left-hand does something wrong cut it out. If somebody slaps you on this side you turn another face to them. I have yet to see one Christian who has taken out even one eye. It's very difficult. Very difficult you see to face yourself, see for yourself that your eyes are looking. Even I mean Muhammad Sahab just thought that Christ was very hard on only men so he passed also some more things for women. Also, he used sharia which is a very very difficult thing also because this sharia was passed or you can say passed to  Moses by God Almighty. That is what he said. Because he saw such a ticketed society of the Jews that he said if you steal something  let your hands be cut. All kinds of things. Very difficult. But I think that the Jews were clever enough so they said we can't do this, so  leave it alone and they did not follow. But the Muslims took it over. I tell you I have yet to come across one Muslim who has cut his hand, who has done anything like that. It is an impossible situation. Actually, these people thought you are all enlightened great saints. These are things meant for only saints. If the saints do anything wrong that is how they should be dealt with. Not for normal human beings and thus we developed something called guilt within us.And this guilt is also intensified by confessions by saying you are a sinner.You are a sinner and if you have to achieve something you should get rid of your sins, so you pay money to them and they think you can get rid of your sins. All such absurd things also we have been following. Our forefathers have been following. Then some people believed that if you read a book you can go to Heaven. The other day I met some Hare Rama people. I must tell you about this. He came to see me.He is the head of Chicago something and he was wearing a dhoti.It was quite cold that day, so I said, why do you wear this dhoti? What is the need?It is very cold. No, my Guru has initiated that I should wear this dhoti. I said but it is very very cold, why do want to wear? As a mother, I feel terrible. Why are you wearing this dhoti? By wearing dhoti if you can go to heaven that in India 90% of people wear dhoties only.They are saying Hare Rama Hare Krishna.I mean in India, everybody morning time they will get up they say Hare Ram  to another. This is very common. Are they all going to go there? But they shave their heads completely. For that Kabira has said, if by saving hair if you can go to heaven all the sheep who are every year shaved will go first there. So the religion also is a mockery of religion and I don't know how to convince them. When I told them they would not listen.They said no our guru has done it and guru is. Their Guru had so many wrinkles like I don't know if you know about a jockey (not clear). Exactly like him,he had all the wrinkles on his face, and why this  hostility, for whom, for god almighty who is your father. He loves you. Why should you do all these hostilities? Don't read this and I don't do that.Fast. Go to the Himalayas.Stand on your heads for hours together and face the cold. How can a father who loves you so much would like all this? How can any father would like his son to starve himself and kill himself to reach him? They have no idea of a fatherhood, I think. The way they are prescribing  things to people to be so austere and these austere people are horribly hot-tempered. If you have to reach them you have to take a bargepole. This man himself  got so angry with me because I said all these things.So I told him that if you read Geeta, Krishna has said everything comes from  anger and how are you having anger, just selling the Geetas everywhere. And reading, reading what happens  that whatever is written inside nobody knows that these are just like we were coming they said  now this is  Long island this, that like it's just a kind of a direction which you have to follow. But if you stand there and go on reading Manhattan, Manhattan, Manhattan, will you come here? So again Kabira has said very beautiful things. He said that by reading too much, padi padi pandit  murkha huai,  by reading too much people have become, even the learned have become stupid. I used to think how can that be? But I have met so many now, I believe it. So now we have to be sensible. Whatever has happened has happened. Whatever we have done is done but now what we have to have is our Self Realisation. When the Kundalini rises she enlightens, enriches your centres. All the world problems are mostly from human beings but all the human problems are from their centres. When these centres are in trouble you have physical mental and emotional as well as individual problems.All your stress and all this modern thing that you see, yuppies disease and all that is because Kundalini has not risen and not nourished your centres and has not connected  you  to this all-pervading power. For example, this instrument now here has three connections but if you don't even have one connection how will I work it out. Without the connection people say we have been praying, we have been doing this but no you are not connected. Your prayers don't reach there.There should be some connection. In the same way, this Kundalini just is your mother. She is your own mother. Individual mother. She knows everything about you.She knows about your past. Knows about your aspirations.She knows about everything. And now you don't have to judge yourself at all. She knows everything then why should you judge yourself? To feel guilty, to condemn yourself, if somebody says you are a sinner, you just believe it. Never believe such people. What right have they got to say such a thing? After all, you are human beings. You are not god's.I mean if you don't commit  mistakes people will say you are not a human being. You are supposed to commit mistakes. So all this kind of a conditioning we have had that we are sinners, we must do this, has to go away and you are not to feel guilty at all for anything.I mean there are people who can feel guilty for something happening in Vietnam.There is no need. Your job is just to understand yourself  that you are born as a human being and you are to be born again as a spiritual and enlightened personality, Buddha.That is what you have to be. Actually, the word bodh means the same and ved also means the same from where the  (UNCLEAR)means,  'to know' on your central nervous system this  all-pervading power which is the totality, which is the reality.Now your attention becomes absolutely, absolutely pure.There is no lust and greed in your attention anymore. For our country here it is very important that we should really get rid of these two problems that we suffer from. You become absolutely innocent and your eyes have a light of innocence.Such a person even he looks at somebody, even a glance can do such a lot and can establish such feelings of joy in other people, that it is just to be experienced and to be seen.Now our modern life is such that we are all the time thinking, thinking, thinking too much. For nothing.Anything just like a machine our brain is working, as a result,a thought rises, falls, thought rises, falls, and we jump on the cusp of the future or past which doesn't exist. But if I say now you come to your present you cannot.In the present is the reality. So what happens when this Kundalini rises, she elongates those thoughts and so you get established in the present where there is peace. That is the source of peace. Unless and until you have this peace no use talking about peace in establishing all big, organisations. I have met many people who have got  big,big awards of peace, they are so horribly hot-tempered that you have to approach them with a bargepole. Always agitated, angry you know. Cant believe how did they get peace award. On the contrary, it is  the other way round. They do get because people can camouflage something I think. The peace is within yourself and once you  establish that peace then  you become a witness.You start seeing  the whole thing as a drama. They do not get agitated.Now see  people are so agitated till now you see I was in the car today I was very late, I was just watching. I said all those who want  their self-realisation will stay on. Makes no difference. Let us go whenever we have to go that's the time we fix, now will go at that time. Not to be agitated. Now you can imagine my age now is 72 years of age and I am travelling every day. Travelling every day. Travelling having a program. Travelling again program. Nothing happens to me. Because I don't think I  travel. I am in thoughtless awareness. I am without any thoughts. I am just in that complete presence. Whether I am in the aeroplane or outside I am in thoughtless awareness. You are fully aware but you are thoughtless.No bombardment of thoughts for me. Just you are watching the whole thing as a big drama and it works. Whenever your attention goes it acts. Just you have to put attention and to it and it works. You will be surprised how things work out through your attention. Now you enter into the kingdom of God in the real sense of the word is not just a lecture or a sermon but you do it. As a result, you get all the blessings, amazingly. The blessings you get is something no one can explain. There is something I must tell you. There was one Indian Sahaja yogi. He came from his work, he got into the car and one fellow came with a dagger and he pierced the dagger through him. He started bleeding but he said I never felt frightened or anything. I just got hold of him,got  his dagger from him and he ran away but then he saw his friend coming out of the same shop where he was working and he called him and both of them were searching for this fellow for two hours with all the bleeding going on and nothing happened to him. He was absolutely normal. Now another case which is also so remarkable that it is difficult to believe. There's a girl she got very frustrated in life but she's a Sahajayogini in a way. Her father was a Sahaja yogi but this girl,I don't know, in her frustration took her father's revolver and hit herself. Can you imagine the bullet came out it is a fact, and she was bleeding. She was taken to the hospital. Doctor 's were surprised. Her lungs are alright. Everything is alright as if this bullet was going through some channel outside, or  they could not explain.Its a miracle. Such miracles take place, not for your protection of your life but so many other things. You are amazed  how you get cured of incurable diseases. Now here I was told that they have lost a complete war against cancer but we cannot work here for cancer because  we  will be arrested  and  will put us in jail. We are not supposed to use any other method but the method of allopathy. But with allopathy, we cannot cure. With Sahaja yoga, we can.  There are four doctors who have got their MD in Delhi University. I say we have much more freedom than what you have because these four doctors who got their MD and now one of them is here. In different subjects, where they try to show how you can cure incurable diseases. It is fundamental we are dealing with. Sahaja yoga is a meta-science.We are dealing with the fundamentals of our centres. If you know how to correct the centres of your own and the correct the centres of others you have done your job. Now, what happens that on your fingertips you can feel your own centres but not only that but you can feel the centres of others because you jump into a new dimension of your awareness which is called as collective consciousness, called samuhik chetna. First, you establish your thoughtless awareness which is nirvichara samadhi and later on by using this power you become doubtlessly aware. That  is called as nirvikalpa samadhi. You then can do it.Everyone of you. You see nobody is so much lost that you cannot do it but have faith in yourself. The main point is to have faith in yourself. In this short time, I cannot tell you more than this but what I have to tell you that above all you jump into the ocean of joy. Happiness and unhappiness are the two sides of one coin. When your ego is pampered you feel happy. When it is punctured you feel unhappy. But joy is something so singular that you see the whole thing and it gives you joy. See I see a beautiful carpet so immediately I  go into thoughtless awareness.So all the joy the artist has put in this this carpet starts giving me beautiful joy and vibrations.I enjoy that and like waves of joy and peace coming in. This is what is your potential. This is what you have to get. You don't know how glorified  you are as human beings but you have to take to it. I must say that in America it has been very difficult to say these things because most of the seekers were lost with the false gurus. But I am very happy to see so many people taking interest in Sahaja yoga today. It was never the case like this before and we tried everything.They would listen to me, they would like it and the only thing that they told me all the time was that if you are not taking money then there is no credibility. You must take money.It must be marketed. In Boston, they asked me how many Rolls Royces I have? I said none. My husband has one Mercedes that's all.They said that means you are not in the business? I said, no-no. No business. You cannot do business about this. They said we are not interested.They won't take me even on television or anything, nor even they would publish  advertisements.The situation is very difficult. But you will be happy to know in Russia it is very different. Russians are so sensitive to spirituality. So very sensitive, that I first time went to Leningrad, they did not know me.They had  never seen me. Nothing of the kind. There were 2000 people all the way all inside and 2000 were standing outside. I was quite amazed.I said how is it you trust me so much. It's obvious, it's obvious.They said Mother, what about us we can't get into the hall.I said alright let me finish with these.I went and talked to them and gave a realization in no time. When I came out they were all sitting there so I said now if you want to have your realisation you come tomorrow morning we will have it in the open air. Not only that. This 4000 came also they got two thousand more and they were all there and they all got their realization.They are so sensitive I am surprised. All these false Gurus have been thrown away by them.Just thrown away. They reported to the government as to what they have done, and how they have suffered and what these people are up to and thrown away.Now except  for me nobody is accepted even by the government.You will be surprised that they gave me an award this time.There were 2000 scientist and 10,000 people in a conference, the highest academician in Science and philosophy. Imagine. I felt so shy.I said, what are you doing, it is too much.So they said Mother, why what's the harm.There were only 10 people who  had got it so far, Saint Petersburg University. So they said Mother why do you feel that it is too much.It is nothing.I said Einstein is one of them.You mean to say, you put me higher than  Einstein? They said what Einstein has done? He  just managed or whatever it is,he did all the invention about  matter, but you are doing about human beings. Just see the understanding and the people are so wise there, so introspect. At least I am sure 65 to 70% Sahajayogies will be there in that country. Even Romania.Same thing. I am amazed that when we got our democracy we lost ourselves completely in the so called  freedom. Choosing this, choosing that.This should be different, that should be different. Perhaps  all our attention is lost in  those things, and those who pampered our ego. We like  them or whatever it is, I can't understand, that normal things people did not understand. I think the worst curse came from Mr Freud. And he reduced people to a sex point. We are sex points or human beings? And there is something more  than that has to happen. All these ideas of Freud, when I told them they were very angry with me but now you read books. Fraudulent Freud. Downfall of Freudian Empire. All kinds of books coming from America but they discover it so late. I think it was 25 years back, Freud Freud Freud Freud. And these people who did that used to shake before me just like this. They have weakened the people, weakened the families, weakened the society, weakened the whole Nation from within. While you are great seekers of divine since long, is already said by Bruvamunni that those people are today who are seeking God in the hills and Dales will be born as  householders and then they will get their realisation.It is a fact.It is happening. It sounds fantastic but it is a fact, is the truth I am telling.I am very happy there are so many people in New York where I never expected that this would  happen. You all have waited for me. Thank you very much for that. This lecture you know is just one of them, I must have given at least in the English language 4000-5000 lectures.So you can get hold of them later on but better not listen to my lectures. First, you get your realisation.That is important because lecture also creates  say waves of thoughts in the mind and then why she said so?Why she said so?Now let us see if we can get our realisation.I can see the beautiful lights. You have to just switch on one switch and all of them light up because all of it is built-in. Without the light no use talking about something which is so important. Enlightenment is very easy for you. Extremely easy. Take it from me. Not difficult. Because it is all built-in with in you. It is already there. And it takes hardly any time for you to jump into that new awareness about which I am talking. They talk about New Age. I mean in this country, they talk of a new age and New Race. Where are they? They are taking to drugs, alcoholism and this that. After Sahaja Yoga, you will be surprised I have seen people give up drugs overnight. Overnight. How? Supposing I am a very obstinate person and I have in my hand a snake. You tell me that you have a snake in your hand. I will say, no it's a rope because it is darkness I can't see. Till the snake bites me I go on saying no, it is not a snake it a rope. But supposing there is little light. Immediately I will throw away that. In the same way this light enlightens you and you get such wisdom about yourself and all that is destructive you just throw it away.No more,  to have it anymore. I don't have to tell you don't do, don't do, nothing. You better take realisation and in that light, you yourself will manage yourself, I don't have to tell you anything. That's not me. So it will take about 10 to 15 minutes at the most as you have waited.I would request you those who want only I can give them realisation. Because I respect your freedom absolutely. If you do not want to have it I cannot force it on you.You cannot.It is a living process. So first you have to desire for it and also this Kundalini is the power of pure desire. All other desires are impure. Today we want to have a house then we want to have furniture in it, then we want to have a car then you are to have a helicopter, and you go on like that.Never satiated. The reason is not pure desire. If it was it would have given satisfaction but it does not. So now we are here. Within 10-15 minutes we are going to jump into a new awareness when you are going to feel this all-pervading power on your fingertips. I know you all have questions.You all are very intelligent people but this is beyond  mind. Whatever I have said is not to be taken so seriously. Just remember that all of you are capable of getting your enlightenment and in that light, you can see for yourself, what you are. What is your  weakness, what is your potential? I mean I have seen people going so much above their own expectations like this Miss India, Miss Universe, she is a Sahaja yogini. She came to me she asked me, mother, I am going for this kind of a thing, beauty contest. I said go ahead. I don't want to wear funny dresses.I said no-no as you  sometimes wear swimming dress after all once in a while you have to wear the swimming      dress, doesn't matter. So I said you are going for what? She said now for Miss India and then for Miss Universe. Alright I said, you will become Miss universe. S he has become.She is not such a beauty I would say, but the way she answered the way she had poise,  the way she showed  her maturity she got it. I have  known many musicians like Amzad Ali Khan,(UNCLEAR)Khan,Debu Chaudary, so many Indians they came to Sahaja Yoga and after that, they prospered.Specially Debu had a problem.His thumb had the problem of a artist thumb.He got cured and today he is a very well known musician. Artists, painters all kinds of qualities which is within  you. So much potential. A person who is a chartered accountant who has never known  anything about poetry has become a great poet. So all these things are within you always. And you just manifest them but you don't develop an ego. You enjoy your own virtues. Become extremely dynamic at the same time extremely compassionate and extremely humble. Look at these gurus. They have nothing. No enlightenment. All these Sahajayogies who are sitting here are all enlightened people. They haven't developed any horns or anything. They are not going about in funny dresses but they are all enlightened, each one of them is capable of giving realisation. And can you imagine? Same thing with you. Today you are facing me, tomorrow you will be sitting this side. This is what it is.It is promised in the scriptures this is what we have to have. No use talking about all these things like I am a twice-born somebody comes to you just like anybody else. What is twice-born? Twice Born is a person who is enlightened.Sanskrit they call it Dvijaha means born twice. Dvijaha. To  egg. Also to a bird. Because  it is an egg  and then it becomes a bird. Also to an enlightened person, they call it Dvijaha, means the one who is  first a human being then becomes enlightened,but it is like another brand born again,if there is no difference. Then you become so righteous, so beautiful. You are amazed to see how. So we have to now   just think that we have to have this which is our right and not feel any way obliged to me.No way. It is your own.And it will  all work out. I am sure it will work out tonight, the way you had to wait and  the way you enjoyed the  music.Look at these. These are not Indians, but singing Indian, Sanskrit, Marathi, songs and even to say one sentence of Hindi by an English man was the greatest headache. You cannot teach an English man a Hindi song leave alone one sentence but they are singing  Sanskrit songs. Also, Indian music is very difficult.It is very systematic. I myself am surprised sometimes when they say the Indian musicians say that we are ashamed. How could they do it because we had to practice for years together and how have they done it?How could they do it?It is remarkable.So now I again give one minute for people who want to leave. But don't disturb others.If you don't want to do it, don't do it  but it is not proper ,it is not civil to disturb other people by walking out and going out while doing it,  watching them.Whatever I am telling you today is not to be done afterwards.It is just for tonight.You have to do. It's a very simple thing very very simple. But there are three conditions which are also very simple. The first one I have already told you. You are not to feel guilty at all. When you feel guilty then it develops a problem on this side of this centre-left side of Vishuddhi chakra, and as a result what you develop, maybe spondylitis may be angina may be all your organs will be completely lethargic. With this one centre.Now with this comes with guilt so-called. If you have done anything wrong at that moment is better to face it up and finish it. What is the use of storing it here, to get all these diseases.It is a fashion to feel guilty.To feel guilty is a fashion So please not to feel guilty about anything.Moreover, the Kundalini is rising supposing this obstruction how will she pierce through? Now the second condition is that you have to forgive everyone in general in the sense that you don't have to think about, just you have to forgive. Now you will say that it is very difficult to forgive. I mean whether you forgive or don't forgive, what do you do? Nothing. You are carrying on with the myth but because of that, you suffer.You suffer. You play into wrong hands. All your life you suffer, and there is no sense in saying that I cannot forgive because you don't do anything. So you have to forgive but more at this moment. This centre is constructed like this absolutely like this. IT won't open. Unless and until you forgive it won't open like this and only then the Kundalini can pass through. So just imagine how important it is. So just forgive everyone.Forgive every one.In general you don't even have to think about it because thinking  itself is a headache. So just forgive them. That means you  should be very pleasantly placed towards your self.Very pleasantly placed. Nothing wrong with you. Very simple for you to get your Realisation, and you don't care what others have done to you. Past is past.It is finished. The third one is another very simple one. That you have to take out your shoes. There's nothing serious inside. Because this Mother Earth is very kind. She suckes in all your problems in herself at this moment, so just take out your shoes. I hope you don't mind.In England, when the first time I told them you have to take out your shoe half of the them walked out.I was really surprised by how they were identified with their shoes.Alright as I  said you should be pleasantly placed towards yourself. You should not feel guilty at all and just forgive.Forgive every one.It's very good.Now you have to sit comfortably. Don't have to slouch or put any strain on you. Just comfortably. I said you don't have to go to the Himalayas. Nothing. On your chairs sitting down here you will get your Realisation. But have faith in yourself. Know that you are going to get it. Just know that you are going to get it.It's just your faith in yourself that is going to work it out. Now somebody has to show.Alright. She will show you how you will have to nourish your centres, which is for today only. You don't have to do it again. Just for today. Now please put both the hands towards me like this. Just like this.Comfortably.Now put one of them on your lap comfortably again, on your left lap.Now the right is like this.Now the left one is symbolic because on the left side we have the power of Desire of mundane life. So is here by suggesting that you want your Self Realisation.So left hand towards me.You are working on your left hand. The right hand is symbolic about the power of action, so we use our right hand for giving nourishment to our centres. Please put the right hand now on your heart. In the heart resides the spirit which is the reflection of God Almighty.Now if you become the spirit then you become your own guide, your own master. So now please put your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side. This is the centre of your mastery which is being created by great prophets. Now you please take your hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side. This is the centre for pure divine knowledge.It looks funny but it is so. You will know how it is. Now take your hand again in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side. Now please take your hand now on your heart again and now put your right hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder and turn your head to your right. I've already told you about the centre when it is in jeopardy you get all kinds of diseases because you feel guilty. Please take your right hand on top of your forehead across and please put down your head. This is a centre where we have to forgive everyone in general and now I am showing you how to do it but later on, we will close our eyes and do it. Now please take the right-hand backside of your head and push back your head as far as possible. This is the centre where you have to ask forgiveness from this divine power without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, just for your own satisfaction. Now please the last centre is very important. Stretch your palm. Put the centre of your palm on top of the fontanelle bone area which was the soft bone in your childhood. Now most important is to push back your fingers so there is a good pressure on your scalp. Now please put down your head. Please put down your head and now move the scalp with the pressure seven times clockwise. Please push back your fingers. That's all we have to do.Thats all.Now we will have to close our eyes and you don't have to open them till I tell you. Your feet should be set apart from each other because left and right side. Those who are sitting on the ground are alright. They don't have to worry, but those who are sitting on the chair should put both the feet away from each other. Also, put the left hand on your left lap comfortably. Now use your right hand for giving vibrations to your heart. And now close your eyes. Close your eyes.Please don't open them till I tell you. Here, you have to ask me a very fundamental question about yourself. You can call me the Mother or Shri Mataji.Mother am I the spirit, ask this question three times. Mother am I the spirit, please ask this question three times. No, no, in your heart.Ask this question in your heart, not loudly.Now, please take down your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen. Here you have to ask another fundamental question about yourself. So in your heart, please say it three times Mother, am I, my own master. Please ask in your heart three times, Mother am I, my own master. I have told you that I respect your freedom and I cannot force pure divine knowledge on you. You have to ask for it.So please put your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side and here you have to ask six times because this centre has got six petals. So please ask six times, Mother, please give me pure divine knowledge. As soon as you ask for pure divine knowledge the Kundalini starts rising so you have to nourish your higher centres with your full self-confidence. Now raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side, and here you have to say with full self-confidence ten times, Mother, I am my own master. Please say it. Mother, I am my own master. Say ten times. At the very outset I have told you that you are not this body this mind, this emotions this intellect, this ego or these conditionings but you are the pure spirit. So now raise your right hand on top of your heart and say it again with full self-confidence twelve times, Mother I am the pure spirit. Please say twelve times, Mother I am the pure spirit.This all-pervading divine power is the ocean of knowledge, is the ocean of compassion, is the ocean of blessings but above all, it is the ocean of forgiveness and whatever mistakes you have committed can be easily dissolved by this ocean of forgiveness so at this moment you please forgive yourself fully and not to feel guilty. Raise your right hand the corner of your neck and shoulder and turn your head to right. Here you have to say sixteen times with full self-confidence, Mother I am not guilty at all. Please say. Very important. I've already told you whether you forgive or you don't forgive you don't do anything but if you don't forgive then you play to wrong hands especially at this juncture where we are just about to enter into the kingdom of God we have to forgive so that this centre of Agnya will open and the Kundalini can easily pierce through so, please. Now take your right hand on top of your forehead across put down your head as far as possible. Here you have to say from your heart not how many times, Mother I forgive everyone in general. Don't think about anyone. Mother, I forgive everyone in general.Say it from your heart not how many times. Now without feeling guilty, without counting, your mistakes just for your satisfaction you have to ask forgiveness from the all-pervading divine power. So now please put your right hand in the backside of your head and here you  have to say again not how many times but from your heart, you have to say O Divine Power, if I have done any mistakes knowingly or unknowingly please forgive me. Again say it from your heart O Divine Power if I have done anything wrong, knowingly or unknowingly please forgive me. Now the last centre is very important and by which the Kundalini will pierce through into the subtle energy of Brahma Chaitanya. So now stretch your  right hand fully and put the centre of your palm on top of the fontenelle bone area. Now please put down your head and stretch back your fingers. Here again, I cannot give you self realisation you have to ask for it. So please move your scalp seven times slowly clockwise saying seven times, Mother please give me my self-Realization or mother please give me my enlightenment, whatever you want to say. Now please take down your hands. Please open your eyes and put both the hands like this, little higher. Now watch me without thinking. Now you have to put the right hand towards me and put down your head and see with your left hand if there is a cool or hot breeze like vibrations coming out of your head. Please. Please don't put your hand on top. Little away from  it.Some people get it  further, more. Please see. Now please try again with the left hand towards Me and right hand, bend your head, with the right hand on top of the Fontenelle bone area. If it is still hot that means you have to forgive yourself or forgive others. If you do that it will cool down, I am sure. Now last. Again the right hand please put down your head. I think you have  not forgiven others. That is very important to forgive others. Now see with your left hand on top of the fontenelle bone area, move your hand and see there is a cool or a hot breeze like vibrations coming out of your own head. Now don't doubt it. Don't doubt it. Now raise both your hands towards the sky like this and push back your head and ask this question, three times, any one of these three questions you can ask three times. First, is, Mother is this the Cool Breeze of the Holy Ghost? Three times. Mother, is this the All-pervading power of Divine love? Three times. Anyone of them. Mother is this the Paramachaitanya? Is this the Ruh?Ask. Anyone of these questions three times in your heart. Push back your head. Please put them down. All those who have felt cool or hot breeze like vibrations on their fingertips or on their palms or out of their fontanel bone area, please raise both your hands.
