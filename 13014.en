Arrival at the venue for the Public Program

Two lady reporters interview Shri Mataji. Sahaja Yogi translates what the first reporter asks:

Reporter: At Your birth it was something happened in the ward or in Your family or in the town You were born?

Shri Mataji: I have so many things, so many. I have so many things that happened.

Reporter: One example.

Shri Mataji: You see, many people had said they saw signs. Also My mother, she saw in her dreams that a Lady in White is coming to save the world. My mother was a very intelligent woman. She was Masters of Mathematics and she was also very, very righteous person.

Reporter: If You can tell them about some visionary experience You had, something to be useful for the mankind for our path to the truth.

Shri Mataji: When I know everything, what is there to vision? When I know everything there's no question of vision.

Reporter: ...some dream, some personal experience from Your childhood, from Your adolescence, from maturity You had - if it's possible to unveil some visionary experience You had.

Shri Mataji: I was never a visionary as such I must say, but I knew My job, I knew My mission from childhood. I was quite aware, Myself.

Second Reporter: ...about this country, about Romania...

Shri Mataji: It's a very beautiful country, and of such musicians that in India we call them gandharvas, means celestial musicians.

Second Reporter: And the woman, professional...

Shri Mataji: Oh, they are very good, very nice. But you must know that women have powers. You must know your powers. You should stabilize your minds and understand what you have. They can do a lot. Now see I will be seventy-four and I am traveling so much. You all can become very powerful.

Translator: The lady says You are one of the happiest human beings coming on this planet.

Shri Mataji: And also I want to make you all happy, very happy.

Translator: Thank you, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: May God bless you.

[The party moves to the hall]

Shri Mataji: It's nice wind there.

Sahaja Yogi: Yes Shri Mataji. A Divine Cool Breeze.

Shri Mataji: They are good ladies, I must say. It's always an idea that one should get a vision and accept certain missions in life.

Sahaja Yogi: We got some miracle photos this morning Shri Mataji. This morning at the railway station. You see the lights around You.

Shri Mataji: All Love.

Sahaja Yogi: ...but this is the most beautiful. There are some others, but not so spectacular like this. She would like You to sign the photograph, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: Normally I never sign because I'm not an actress. That's My name, but also I have another name.

Reporter: Thank you so much.

Transcription of Shri Mataji's talk starts here:

I bow to all the seekers of truth. At the very outset, I've always said that truth is what it is. Without knowing the absolute truth, there cannot be peace on this earth, there cannot be satisfaction, there cannot be happiness and there cannot be joy. We do not know the absolute truth. Whatever we know, we know through our mind. And mind is a myth created by us. This myth is created by our conditionings and our ego. And once this mind is built just like we have a computer, made by ourselves, we start depending on it. But mind can never give you reality. One has to go beyond the mind. Unless and until you go beyond the mind, you can not know the truth. Now what is the truth? The truth is that you are not this body, this mind, these emotions, this ego but you are the pure Spirit.

Another truth is, as you see here beautiful flowers created by Mother Earth, we take them for granted. But it's a miracle. We do not even think that it's a miracle. Who does all this miraculous living things, living works? So I have to tell you there is a all-pervading Power of Divine Love. And this Divine Love does all the living work. We have also evolved to this human stage by this Divine Love. We have never felt the power of this Divine Love. It's an energy, very subtle that works out all this living work we are talking about. Now we have to understand that all the chaos of the world, all the problems of the world and of individual human beings come to us through our ignorance, ignorance of reality.

They have been telling you about the chakras, about the centers that we have. These are responsible for our physical, mental, emotional and spiritual being. When they are in jeopardy, then we get all these problems. But we have a power within us which is in the triangular bone, which is called as sacrum. Now this bone, sacrum bone, is called sacrum, sacred - means the Greeks knew about this. And they worshiped also the Mother Goddess of Athena. But all their mythology is finished, as your mythology is also finished. So, there were people who were very much conscious and aware that there is a power, a Mother Power of compassion and love. This power has brought us to this level of our human existence. But we get lost because we have a freedom to choose right or wrong. And we take to right and wrong with this mind of ours which is a very unstable guide.

For example, I saw in your markets here, also in other countries in the Eastern bloc, so many things selling from America and England and all junk. And you such nice people are wasting your money, precious money into this junk. One thing I must tell you, Indians are that way very wise. There's a kind of a stability. You won't find one shop in India where any one of these imported things are sold. It's thanks to Mahatma Gandhi that the idea of imported things to be boycotted came from him. So, it has helped us a lot because we don't waste our money on things which are not selling in other countries because of recession.

This stability has to come. First of all our securities are to be built, that we are human beings who have wisdom. But how do we get this wisdom? What is the way to get this wisdom within us? So, when this Kundalini rises, She nourishes all these centers. That's how She solves our physical, mental, emotional and spiritual problems. See, these are all Romanian singers and singing Sanskrit songs and Hindi, Marathi songs so well, that nobody can believe they are Romanians. With the awakening of the Kundalini, now they have developed a special type of creativity and sensitivity and also the wisdom that we have to be stable people. When this Kundalini enters into our brain, it enlightens it. Brain is a reality. And then we start seeing the different parts of our brain enlightened and we understand what is reality.

Also when this Kundalini pierces through your fontanel bone area, you get the actualization of your baptism. When you get that actualization you start feeling on your finger tips the Cool Breeze of the Holy Ghost, which is - what I say the Divine Love. You get absolutely relaxed and peaceful. How? Your thought rise and fall, another thought rises and fall and they are coming from the past or the future. But you cannot be in the present. So, we are jumping on the cusp of these thoughts all the time. But when this Kundalini rises, She elongates the thoughts and the space is created, which is the present. At that stage you become thoughtlessly aware. There are no thoughts, but you are fully aware.

The other day we had a conference with the Hatha Yoga people and told them that in Hatha Yoga there are eight parts, ashtangas, eight parts. Only a wee bit part of one of them is exercise. And this exercise is also, is to be done according to the need of the person, or it can complicate your body. It can trouble you. So, the real achievement of Hatha Yoga is also thoughtless awareness. What Patanjali has said? He has said that there should be thoughtless awareness and then there should be doubtless awareness. In those days, one had to work very hard to achieve it. Among thousands of people, one person used to achieve. Also same thing about Tao or about Zen system. One has to go through a great practices years after years to reach the satori stage, they called it [inaudible].

Now this has been absolutely reduced to ten minutes exercise. Like we first build now the dome of the temple and then the temple. Like we raise the Kundalini by which you get the light, light of your Spirit. Maybe little, but you do get. In that light you see yourself. As I always give you the example of a snake in My hand. There is darkness and I am very egoistical and I can't see what is in My hand. Till the snake bites Me, I don't believe it is a snake. Anybody tells Me, I won't listen. But as soon as little light comes in, I through away that snake. In the same way, you throw away whatever is destructive in you.

I never say, "Don't do this and don't do that." I do not say about the Ten Commandments. These are not the days for Ten Commandments. But let them have their own light. In their own light they can see what's wrong with them. They become their own masters, they become their own gurus and let them grow in reality.

That is what Sahaja Yoga is, today's Sahaja Yoga. "Saha" is "with", "ja" is "born with you," is the right to become a self-realized personality. In these special times, I call it a blossom time, which is definitely, believe Me, is the Last Judgment. If you want to go to hell, you can go to hell and if you want to go to Heaven, you can go to Heaven also. It is your choice and in this choice, you are free to decide what you want. Somebody asked Me, a newspaper lady once, "what is the proof that it is the Judgment time?" I said that "you can see from..." You must have seen the photographs, miraculous photographs. There were never cameras before. So, Mohammad Sahib said, "Don't make My picture." And Christ's pictures are, sometimes He looks like a Catholic Roman or He looks sometimes like somebody from France or somebody from England, depending on the artist.

But now, these cameras are doing wonderful work, I should say. They are producing such miraculous photographs, that I am amazed, but to prove that this is the Last Judgment, so be careful. So, what you have to achieve is self-knowledge, to begin with. So you know which of your centers are catching, where are you in trouble.

Supposing somebody comes and tells Me, "Mother, please improve my Agnya." That means he is saying that "Mother, I'm egoistical. Please, correct my ego." Normally we would never say like that.

So, we talk the language of chakras and centers. These give us full idea as to what is our physical state, what is your mental state, what is your emotional state and what is your spiritual state. All right. So, now after knowing what's wrong with you, if you know how to correct it, then there's no problem.

The second thing that happens to you, that you know about others also. Because this human awareness develops a new awareness of collective consciousness. So you can feel on your finger tips what's wrong with others also. If you can cure yourself, you can cure others also.

And that is how Sahaja Yoga is spreading like wild fire, like the seeds, you see, which just float in the air and go on spreading. Because the time is such. It's very important time, I think, that this is happening because the Divine, Itself, is anxious. It is helping so much that never it has happened before. According to Indian philosophy, there is what we call - this is Kali Yuga, ghor Kali Yuga, worst time. When people go into illusions, into bhranti - illusions. And at this time only they will take to seeking, seeking of the truth. And this Kali Yuga is now getting into another thing called Krita Yuga, where all these vibrations, or we can say the Paramchaitanya is acting. People can't believe in it.

First of all, we have no faith in ourselves. We think, "How we can get it?" We have been conditioned by saying that we are sinners, we are good-for-nothing people. But that's not true. Nobody is a sinner. It's just a myth again in the head. It works so fast now, so people were amazed that for this Kundalini awakening, people took births after births and "Mother, how is it working so fast?"

I said, "Nobody went to moon before this and now how we are going to moon?"

The time has matured, matured human beings. Whether you are educated, uneducated, whatever you are, as long as you are a human being you have a right to get your Self Realization. But of course we can't give Realization to arrogant people or the people who have already some ideas about Realization. One thing we must understand, that if we have to change the world, we have to change human beings. People think by giving lectures, having conferences and this and that, peace will come. It will never come. A global transformation has to come for peace, for wisdom and for joy. And that's what happening.

There is so much to be said on Sahaja Yoga. Only thing you have to know that you have many powers. First is the power of great compassion. And this compassion acts and it works. It's not just talk or it's not lip service but actually it acts. You have to just mature into that. This can happen to you today, to all of you. There are so many already, so many Sahaja Yogis here.

But after that you must grow, just like a seed that is planted and has to grow into a tree. Must pay little time, only time, not money, for your growth. You must respect yourself. Otherwise it's like a seed which is sprouted and finished. Then you will know what is your identity, what is your glory, what is your greatness. This truth is the Divine Love. If you love somebody, you know everything about that person. In the same way, truth is Divine Love. And you become a very mature, wise person.

I am so much happy to come to Romania. In Sanskrit "ramana" means to enjoy. You have to now just know your Self and enjoy your Self. As I said in this short speech, I cannot say everything about Sahaja Yoga. Only thing is that you should ask for it. I cannot force on you, because I respect your freedom. If you want to have, you can have it. And if you don't want to have, nobody can force you. So anybody who doesn't have it should leave the hall, though it will hardly take ten minutes more for you to receive your Realization. This is your own, you don't have to pay for it, neither you are obliged to anyone. You'll be amazed how your problems will be solved by the help of this Divine Love.

Now I have to tell you that there are two conditions, very simple ones. First of all is not to believe that you are guilty, you have done something wrong. Whatever wrong you have done is in the past, is finished. You are here in the present. If you feel guilty, then this center here on the left side catches. And then you develop angina or maybe the spondylitis or maybe lethargic organs. But why to have all these headaches. Because to feel guilty is also a mental activity. If you were guilty you would not have been here, you would have been in jail. So firstly forgive yourself. Just forgive yourself. Have a very pleasant attitude towards yourself.

Now, second is to forgive everybody. Now the center here is like this, very constricted, like this. And to open this you have to forgive. You don't have to think about the people whom you are to forgive because if you think about them, it will give you headache. In general you should say in your heart that "Mother, I forgive everyone." These are only two very simple logical conditions.

Now, I request you to take out your shoes if possible. In England, first time when I asked them to take out their shoes, most of them walked out. So much attached to their shoes they were. But Romanians are much wiser.

I told you it will take hardly ten minutes, hardly, really because you are so aware, you are so beautiful. But have faith in yourself; that's very important. Now, I would request you all to put your both the hands towards Me. You can put down your fans and put both the hands towards Me. Just like this. Now, you have to bend your head and put the left hand towards us and put the right hand on the top of the fontanel bone area which was a soft bone in your childhood. Please bend your heads.

Now, see for yourself if there is a cool or a hot breeze, like vibrations, are coming out of this fontanel bone area. This is a soft bone in your childhood. Sometimes you get it very close to the head, sometimes away, but don't put your hand on top of your head.

Now, please put your right hand towards Me like this and bend your head, and see with your left hand. If it is hot that means you have not forgiven yourself or not forgiven others. So, please now forgive yourself or others. Once again. Please put your left hand towards Me and put your right hand on top of your head. And now see for yourself. Again, sometimes you get it far away. So, see it clearly and have faith that is coming from your head. Bend your heads. They didn't bend.

Now, please put both your hands towards the sky, like this, and push back your head. Here you have to ask one of these questions three times in your heart. You can call Me "Mother" or "Shri Mataji," Now say in your heart three times one of these questions. The first one is - push back your head and first one: "Mother is this the Cool Breeze of the Holy Ghost?" Now second question is: "Mother, is this the all-pervading Power of Divine Love?" And the third question is: "Mother, is this the Paramachaitanya or Ruh?" Ask anyone of these questions, three times.

And now put down your hands and watch Me without thinking. Don't think. Just don't think. You can do it. All those who have felt Cool Breeze on the fingertips or on their palms or out of their fontanel bone area please raise both your hands. My. The whole, all of them. My goodness!

I bow to you, all Saints now. Your powerful, saintly path has started, life of saintliness which is very enjoyable. Just enjoy yourself.

May God bless you all.

They will now sing one song and you all should clap so that your hands will be more empowered.
