Public Program, "The Significance of Brighton". Brighton (UK), 15 November 1979.

The name itself is so beautiful - Brighton. It has to brighten the whole country. I have been here twice before also, and I always felt that if a chance is given to me in this place, we can really start Sahaja Yoga in a big way, and can... one day .... become a pilgrimage. There are mixed vibrations in Brighton. You have the sea. Also, the mother earth here has special significance, but when something Divine starts emitting itself, the evil comes in a disguise, and accumulates in that place, and starts fighting... fighting the Divine, and that's how, it's a very mixed vibrations, I felt in Brighton. But on the whole it is a very good place, where Sahaja Yoga can prosper.

       They must have told you about Sahaja Yoga. 'Saha' is 'with', 'Ja' is 'born with you'. This is the Yoga - this is the union... that you are seeking with the Divine.... is born with you. It is within you. Everybody has said, "You seek Him within yourself". Even Christ said 'You seek Him within yourself,' That means you have to seek... it is your freedom... which cannot be challenged. You have to ask for it, for example, if God could, at this stage of human awareness, transform you to higher awareness... without you coming into that play... your freedom coming into that play... he would have done it long time back. But he cannot. You have to choose Divine in your own freedom.

       You are seeking, definitely. Perhaps you do not know what you are seeking. But one thing is definite. You are not satisfied with whatever you are... you think there is something beyond which you have to seek. Maybe some of you know, some of you do not know, what you have to seek. But there is something beyond, no doubt, which has been told to you by all the prophets, by all the scriptures, by all the great incarnations that came on this earth. It has been promised also, that you will be judged one day. The judgement, will be first your own... of yourself... whether you are seeking the Divine or some sort of a frivolous thing. If you are seeking the Reality and the Truth, then only, you are going to be chosen, then only, you are going to become the citizen of God's Kingdom.

       Now, let's see who is this God and what am I talking about. In the beginning... it was just... a Silence... complete Silence. And out of the Silence, when it awakened, the Silence was awakened. That Silence is called as "Parama-Brahma", in Sanskrit language. I am sorry, I have to use Sanskrit language - it doesn't mean that it is something Hindu. These ideas you must get rid of. Because in India, people have meditated much more, they didn't have to fight the Nature, like the one we were fighting now coming down to the hall. The atmosphere is so nice and warm - people can live even under a tree. They had lot of time - they didn't have to fight the Nature so much, so they had lot of time to meditate. And in their meditations they have found out certain things, for which they have used Sanskrit language.

       So, this Parama-Brahma, or you can call it, this Silence, the Absolute Silence, was awakened, got awakened because it, itself got awakened.... like we sleep and we get awakened. And then this Silence became what you call Sadashiva, when it was awakened. And when this Sadashiva started breaking, in the sense that It wanted... It desired... to create. As we say, that the morning sun is breaking through the dawn... in the same way, when His desire started manifesting, His desire became His power, and It got separated from Him. Now, whatever I say is just a story for you... you need not believe it, but I will reach up to a point where you will see something which you can believe into, and then gradually, step by step you can believe into this theory. This is just a hypothesis for you.

       So, when this desire became a power, his power... It was called as Shakti or Mahashakti or Adi... Means Primordial Power. This Primordial Power assumed a personality and entity - it had to, if it had to act. If you have only a desire in your heart, it's no good. We have to transform it into some form, otherwise it will...... the desire will rise and it will fall off. So, this desire got into a form, we can say, or entity, which is called in the Bible, as Holy Ghost and in the Sanskrit language as Adishakti.

       This desire, then created out of itself two more powers - one to act, and one to improve on its own creation. Like that, three powers started acting, and these three powers were created. Now, as we know that people have not talked about Holy Ghost much, in the Bible..... nor in many of these scriptures, which have talked about the Father, have been able to talk about the Holy Ghost. Specially, when Christ's Mother Herself was an incarnation of Holy Ghost - he didn't want to endanger Her life. He didn't even say that She was the incarnation of Holy Ghost - because if they had crucified Her, he would have come out in his own destructive powers. But, the drama was to be played and She remained a silent person.

       Now, this Holy Ghost is important... for us, because Father is just a witness. He is witnessing the play, the game that Holy Ghost is going to play. He is going to enjoy Her creation. He is the only witness of that game, and She is trying to please Him by creating this, because it was His desire, to create. So She created. With these three forces we have got, which I call: the first the Desire (Mahakali); then the second one was the Action (Mahasaraswati); and the third one is the Sustenance, or you can call it the Evolution (Mahalakshmi). These three powers acted, to create us - human beings. Now we are at a stage where we have reached, where one can talk about these things.

       Even at the time of Christ, one could not talk of the Holy Ghost. What could you do with these fishermen? Just tell me, how could you tell them about these things? That was just a preparatory thing, but you know, what a mess they have done. Quite a mess is there, and people can't understand those who call themselves religious - how could they be fanatic? Fanaticism and religion are at dagger's ends. They cannot be one thing. You can see now in Iran, now. You can see anywhere, people, if they are fanatics, how irreligious they are, because religion is love.

       God is Love, and none of these "religious people" have expressed that love, so far, in a way it should be expressed. Nor have they taken over the work of seeking God. But other things they are doing, like philanthropic work they'll do - collecting funds, or having a jumble sale... or sort of a thing.. That's not the job of a person who is seeking God. Under these circumstances, when we are face to face with people who are so-called religious, who have organised religions, or disorganised religions, and fake people, we really get absolutely frustrated - we get flabbergasted, and we do not know, what are we to do, because we are born seekers. We are born as seekers. We might have made mistakes, in seeking, but we are definitely seekers. If you were not seekers you would have been happy attending some dinner, or a ball somewhere. But, no. There is something beyond, something beautiful beyond, which is being promised, which you feel there is, you are aware of it - the existence of that beauty, you are aware of it - but so far you have not reached to the source. And that's why you are seeking.

       Now, these three powers are within us, also acting, and they have shown here, if you see, (indicating the chart), on the left hand side is this blue line that is going down, is the power of our desiring, by which we desire, by which we express our emotions... and when this desire is no more left in us - in the sense that this power, when it disappears, within us - then we also disappear. And they have not shown the Spirit, but if you see this ..(..).. line, you can say that that is the Spirit they have tried to show. This Spirit, is the reflection of Father God or the Witness God, who is within us - in our heart, while these three powers, have created like a curtain, between our attention and between Him. Now the attention exists in this green coloured Void.

       It is sustained by our liver, and that's how these three curtains keep us away from that spirit. We cannot see that spirit, we cannot feel it. We cannot manifest it, but we know there is someone who knows us. In Gita, it is called as "Kshetragnya" who is the knower of the field. So, we know there is a knower, and the knower knows all about you, and is tape-recording all that you have been doing, your seeking, your mistakes, your turbulence, all kinds of things you have gone through - all is recorded in that tape, and that tape is placed down below there, in the triangular bone which is called as the Kundalini.

       This is the residual energy of our desire - means when the whole universe was created, this energy of desire, Adishakti, after creating the whole, She remains the whole, because She is complete. You can say, it's very easy to understand. Supposing there is light here and I put a film here, the whole film is reflected, but the film is intact. In the same way after projecting itself, what ever remains... is the residual energy, is this Kundalini - means you are the complete projection of that Kundalini, that power, which is desire power, which manifests later on into these two powers: the right side power, the one you see with the yellow colour - it's called the power of action; and the central power, which you have achieved up to a point, (and the rest is a void: you can see (where)the dotted lines are) - is the power which is responsible for your evolution from amoeba to this stage.

       We should ask a question, "Why did we become human beings - from amoeba to this stage?" Supposing I have some bolts, nuts, this, that... and I gather them together. Then, anybody would ask "Why are you making this?" So I can tell: "I am making a microphone." But this microphone also has got a thread, here. It is to be put to the mains. Unless and until it is put to the mains, this is not going to work out.

       And this is what we have got - these three powers, and the residual power there, which is the desire power, which is just sitting down there, which is going to desire your rebirth. It's your own Mother, and when She desires it, She comes into action only when She sees somebody who's an authority - who has a power to raise Her, who loves the same way as She loves you, then only She rises. Not by any tricks, by standing on your head, or having an exercise, or beating people or all sorts of things, they have devised now. It is a spontaneous thing - Sahaja. Sa-ha-ja. Spontaneously it rises. I mean, supposing now somebody comes to me: "Can you guarantee that my Kundalini will be awakened? Or not.." I say, "No, Sir. I am sorry. May be, may not be. If you do not argue, too much, then it will." Why? What happens with arguments?

       I must tell you what happens. I mean ... I don t mean you should not argue. You must... argue because, I know you have a problem. You are too identified with arguments - you can't help it. Doesn't matter. But when you argue, you use this power which is on the right hand side. By thinking, what happens is that you create that yellow stuff there, and that yellow stuff in common words is Mr. E-go. And when you think, this ego rises like that and goes on pressing the other one - that is the Superego, which comes from your conditionings. So this Ego, when it sits on this one like that, how are we to raise the Kundalini, because what happens is that there is no place, no space - it has to be balanced like that. The more you argue, the more it goes on like that. By argument, I cannot raise the Kundalini. That's why I say, "For the time being let me see about it. Don't argue just now". But, then people don't like it, you see, they feel challenged. So, I say, "Alright go ahead". But what happens when you start arguing, the thoughts go on pressing you, and that is why you cannot do it by any argument - by reading a book. You cannot pay for it. It's absolutely impossible to pay for it. God doesn't have a shop. No, He doesn't know shopping, nor you can organise Him. We cannot organise God. He has to organise us. So, any sort of an organised thing can not work it out.

       It's absolutely like sprouting of a seed. You just put it in the soil, put some water - as I say I put some water of Love, I give you some water of Love - then it sprouts by itself. You have a seed, you have the primule, you have a sprout inside, and everything is just ready. It has to happen. By getting angry, it doesn't work out. By anything that you can do, you cannot work out. You have to be effortless. You cannot put in effort for sprouting a seed. You cannot even transform a flower into a fruit. Actually we don't do much. What we do is dead. Whatever is dead we change into another, then we change into another. That's all. We have done nothing living. This is a living process and all living processes are to be achieved through spontaneity.

       So, spontaneously it rises. It touches your Sahastrara and you start getting the cool breeze in your hand. Now, apart from the Indian Scriptures, where it is described as Saleelam-Saleelam, this cool breeze and cool breeze comes on you like a wave. Also in the Bible you have read that, it is the cool breeze. So, the whole power is this power of desire, which has manifested into these three powers, this Adishakti - is the cool breeze. It's like a cool breeze. And it is All-Pervading. When this Kundalini rises she passes through these centres (of course there's no time for me to explain all those centres now) and touches you. Now these centres are the subtle centres below our plexuses, which we know in our medical science, that these are the plexuses we have got within ourselves. And then you become Self-Realised.

       I cannot give you a lecture on that, or a brain-washing, you become Collectively Conscious. It's actualisation, that we should seek. It has to happen within you, so that you become that - is not just by branding anybody 'you are a Sahaja Yogi' - it cannot be. A Sahaja Yogi has to get the real baptism. His fontanel bone has to become soft and the Kundalini has to pierce it, then only he is a Sahaja Yogi.

       You cannot have membership, you cannot have anything like that. It is so spontaneous and if it has not happened in you, then you are not a Sahaja Yogi. Till it has happened, you are still seeking. But it just takes a split of a second to happen in people - like children I would say. But it can take quite a lot of time with some people, because we have tried to harm ourselves, destroy ourselves. Actually in this country (U.K.) I have seen that there are very beautiful people born, very genuine, honest, humble. Great seekers of the past, of ancient times have been blessed to be born in this country, and also in America. But, they became impatient, and in their impatience, they have tried to destroy themselves. And that's how if you have destroyed those centres, then there will be a little problem for a short time - we'll work it out. But you have to have it. You are born for this. This is evolution which has to take place. You have to know your Self. That's your right. You must get it.

       But the way is not demanding, but asking for it. "Blessed are meek... blessed are those who are meek" has been already said before, that meekness is important - not your arrogance. If you sit on my head and say, "Give us realisation". You see that is not the way. I am not the one who is giving, I should say, but it's you, who are receiving it. Like the river Ganges flows you see - if you throw stones in her, you cannot get water out of her. You have to take a Pitcher, a hollow pitcher and dip it inside, and it will fill, by itself. So it is your own asking which receives... that fulfilment, and you have to find out that fulfilment. Without that you cannot be happy.

       Now we have Sahaja Yogis in London of course, we are progressing with the pace of an ant, I should say. The reason is... it is Reality. You see all other organisations spread because, you pay the money, and you become the great minister of state there, something like that. And you wear a locket, you become the great disciple of a great fake guru you see, or something like that. It is very easy to do that way isn't it? But to become a Sahaja Yogi - you have to face yourself, you have to see yourself, and then the beauty, when it dawns upon you, you can see that it is the Truth - that you have to receive and I have to do it.

       You should not feel obliged, because that's My Job. I am paid for that, You can say. Giving you realisation is My Own Job. I have to do it. Your job is to take it, because that's what you are here for. It's no question of any obligation. It's Love, just Love. I have to love you, and you have to receive the love from me. It just flows, it emits - only I am telling you the way how to receive it. But our human love, you see, is so aggressive, that we cannot understand someone who says, "I love you". We'll run away "You love me, then I'd better run away", because love means possession. You see human love is such - love means domination, is aggression. This is just Love, which soothes you, which raises you to a new awareness, by which you can feel on your fingers the complete enlightenment, and your hands can tell you what centres are there, what centres are catching, in you - and in others.

       There are so many blessings of Sahaja Yoga, which I hope to tell you about when we have a seminar perhaps there, and all these people can tell you also. But I don't know what are your problems. I would like to talk to you if there are any problem or question - but not too long. Because Sahaja Yogis get quite worried about it. The reason is they all have asked me questions you know, quite a lot, they feel quite ashamed... to remember that, firstly. Secondly, they feel excited, that why aren't you getting your realisation you see, why are you asking questions - better have it - is in your hands. So they don't like it. And thirdly, they find sometimes.. that you are asking questions of no value - to yourselves, or to anyone.

       So, one thing if you remember, there is nothing selling here. You have not paid for it. It's something that's just flowing, you see. Such a thing, no-one knows of, you see, in this world. It's just flowing, something beautiful - if you have seen a scene somewhere... beautiful scene, you just watch it. In the same way, if (with) that attitude if you come, just to open your eyes to that, you have to... it's called Unmesh means opening the eyes... just to open your eyes to that beauty, that is your Self. For which you should be ready, to do it, and there should be no doubts about it, because it's not worth it... it's not worth it.

       But if you have any, I would like to attend to them definitely - no doubt. Moreover, sometimes we get very good questions. I have seen that some people who ask questions, are really very good, and also give me some idea as to what is the problem. So that will be also very much welcome. But don't sit down with the attitude of doubting Thomas - that's one thing. So you have to ask me, if any question is to be asked, please ask me because Sahaja Yoga is a very big subject, and it is rather difficult to explain whole of it. But this is the one by which you get your physical, mental, emotional and spiritual integration, because all the centres come into play.... and (that) brings enlightenment in all these four aspects of your life.... into the totality so that you feel your wholesomeness in collective consciousness. Now... is quite a complicated sentence - I have said it in short, but if you have any problem about it, you can ask me - without any fear. Because I am a Mother.
        
May God bless you.
