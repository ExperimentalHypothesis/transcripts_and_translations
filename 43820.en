Evening Program before Adi Shakti Puja 1993

[6:40]You see, there are small children here, so I was thinking the children should go after their program, before the danse to Daglio. And some ladies should go with them because they will be fast asleep. Some ladies can join them. And the rest of us can stay here for the danse. Because they were saying it will be very late for the children to go. All right.Whenever you feel that children should go, you can go to Daglio. But best is you can wait in there, in Palazzo Doria, you can wait there. If children are troublesome or anything, you can take the children to this house of mine, wait there until everybody assembles, then you can take your children away. All right? But I think they will be all right.May God bless you.

[3:25:28]Shri Mataji: ... And not so much of Bharatanatyam, it’s true? [Hindi]But in that one, it had the jalat of Odissi, Because, you see, Gita Govind is mostly done by Odissi people. And they don’t have steps like them, [unsure] too much movement of the body. I was wondering about it, doesn’t matter. So, the Odissi danse is another style but this Bharatanatyam danse also, I think you saw it when you were in Madras last time, when we saw that Ramayana. That was the same. And the Kuchipudi is another one, which you know that our children are learning now in Dharamshala which is also a very dynamic danse, Kuchipudi is. And our children are from all over the world, are learning it in Dharamshala, this Kuchipudi. We’ve got some students from there, the school where all these [inaudible] and all these people have studied. Form there one lady has come to teach them. So, now we have, you see, this style, that they did, is a very special Bharatanatyam.The last one is the "tilana" part. You see, it has a little connexion with Maharashtrians because Shivaji has a brother and he was given a jagir, as they call it, an area to rule, Nagapattinam. Then he went there and he started a big library there and there he started doing this Bharatanatyam "tilana" part. Now it comes from the word "tarana", as we have "tarana" in the note, you see, where you have heard "taranas", when the people sing two, one particular tala [rhythm] and only the notes are sung. And it can go very fast also. The same thing, he changed it into this and he really created a lot of patterns in Bharatanatyam. There is one [inaudible] girl who does that. I don’t know if you have heard about her, she does all that dancing.So, there has been quite a give-and-take. But the purity of dancing has been kept somehow, which is a very good thing because you can get varieties and you enjoy it much more by them.On the whole, this is a very divine danse and it creates very divine feelings and also, it’s very good for the growth of your divine attention because you start living in another world, you see, when it is going on and you start seeing Shiva, Shri Rama, Shri Krishna and all these people. Just praise like that and you start having a rapport with the dancer and you also enjoy that thing where they are all praised so much and appreciated.

You all being Sahaja Yogis, you know all about them, nothing has to be explained about them. But the way they have performed is very interesting. For example, Shiva’s description that he as given is very true and that there was a demon and this demon was afraid of the Mother, you see, he thought that if Bhavani decides it, she can kill him. So, he takes the form of a dwarf, of a child so that the Devi cannot kill him. So, Shiva said, "All right, if you don’t kill him, I’ll kill him". And he killed him but people don’t understand when they see, say, a God standing on top of a child, they can’t understand, "What sort of a God is this one?" So, but this is very deeper to understand the feeling of a Mother that she can’t even kill a rakshasa who is a child. So, Shiva has to say that, "All right, I can kill him because he is a rakshasa after all, he is to be killed." The whole understanding is that it is so much related to Sahaja Yoga. The whole story is related to us, it’s all within ourselves, all these deities are there, all these chakras are there. And if you understand the expression of all, or the manifestations of all these dances is from some Realized souls. Because the way they describe, the way they say things is absolute truth, you see. It’s absolute truth. Amazingly, how they know, little, little things about all these great events that took place thousand of years back. Of course, there are books and things written down. But from that also, they have taken inspiration. But also, some of them are extremely spontaneous.

Now the Meenakshi temple thing that she did was another very great thing which I liked, because I said I thought it was Odissi style. But it was the praise of the Mother in the sense that, what she has done and how she is and it’s the- you see, this temple is one of the most beautiful temples that we have of Meenakshi. Unfortunately, we have not been there. I wish I could take you some time to see even this temple, it’s down out, you see.But Kanchipuram you have seen the temple, in Kanchipuram that she’s described. So, this is all, you see, sort of a coming out of the beautiful incarnations that we had in that Yoga Bhoomi. And these incarnations expressed in danse, it’s something it’s so joyous because it combines so many things it has.

As he said, there’s a bhava, there’s a tala, there’s also the ragas. And the whole thing becomes such a synthesis of all the beauties of Indian music, say, Indian [Sanskrit] the expression of emotions and also of rhythmic patterns. And the kind of rhythmic patterns that we have, you know it very well – I’m so happy, I bless both of you very much for which your [inaudible] and I think everything will work out. If you need anything, please let Me know. In every way I’ll be there to help you for any creativity, for any explanation, anything, I will be able to tell you everything that you want and whatever you need otherwise, also, you can ask Me. All right?May God bless you.

Ananda Shiva, Ananda Shiva, Ananda Shiva.Another thing I wanted to say that Austria has suddenly taken a big leap into creativity I must say. I remember the days when Gregoire wrote to Me, "Mother, I’m absolutely bored, this Austria is a horrible place, you see, I just don’t want to live here. I don’t know why you have asked me to come here and all that. I have no Sahaja Yogis here. All horrible people, all drunkards and all kinds of things".
