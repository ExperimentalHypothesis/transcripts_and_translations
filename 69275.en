Advice To Italian Yogis, Rome Ashram - Nirmala House, Rome (Italy) 20-04-1987

[Guido translates in between whilst Shri Mataji speaks]

Shri Mataji: So I was talking to Germans and it took some time. Italy is doing very well in Europe and I think there’s a competition between Italy and Austria. Now, My complete desire is to come down here for the program some time, for a little more time than normal. But this year [unclear] I have been very, very busy and I’m also going to Australia, which I did not do last time. But this visit was so spontaneous and it was just organised, I think through your great desire and the Easter: both together has worked it out.

It’s efficiency of the Italian Sahaja Yogis that they managed the whole thing in such a short time, otherwise it’s not an easy thing. People are already making plans in England for Guru Puja. So, it is the readiness to get divine help that works out everything. Also, Italians are very lucky to have a wise leader like Guido. [applause] But you must understand that the negativity can come any time and can harm. Now, the gentleman who took over from him was really affected by the negative force of Don. Don’s wife has been to sorcerers and things like that and, first time she touched My feet, My feet went into a funny cramp – I couldn’t understand. But then when I asked her, she had to confess and she told Me that she has been doing all these things. So when I told Don, he wanted to separate from her and wanted to work it out. And he got a good job, but you see, the forces are very powerful. But when he came here, he sort of, gave negativity to this gentleman who got confused, and died. Normally, in Sahaja Yoga, it doesn’t happen.

Now the, one has to learn a lesson from this that, you might be – he was a very nice man, he was very good, he was educated, everything was there, but he was not matured in Sahaja Yoga. You must mature; you must mature in Sahaja Yoga so that nothing can touch you. When you try to stay in the centre, gradually you mature, you develop and then you remain in the centre; nobody can touch you. Another fellow who argued with Don was Hugo, who himself was a schizophrenic person, and I mean, we cured him. And he got caught up because he was not matured enough.

So, the negativity is very easy to catch: like a clean cloth can catch dirt very easily, but to clean the cloth is very difficult. So we have to try to keep ourselves in bandhans and in complete growth, so that nothing can touch us. Like a pot which is not yet baked fully, earthen pot – put water and pressure on it, it stays, but once it is baked, nothing can create an impression on that. See, Sahaja Yoga, as I have told you many a times, has double force; one is centrifugal and another is centripetal. Like, if you have a string in your hand and something is tied to the string – it moves round and round with centripetal force. But if it is loose, it goes at a tangent; it’s a centrifugal force. So if you’re not with the Sahaja Yoga, is not tight, you may go at a tangent. And then, you should not worry as to how your wife is or how your husband is or how anything is, because you are responsible for yourself.

Now, if you start thinking that: ‘My wife is like this,’ or ‘My husband is like this,’ you should only know that they are of a lower calibre; they are lower type of people, lower animals. If they are of any good calibre, with your help, they will come up. But if they are not, they will never. I have also seen some people who are schizophrenic have completely cured in Sahaj Yoga; completely cured, entirely. So it is possible to cure schizophrenia, but if the person is not careful, he might get it back again. But we must understand, with whom are we identifying: with the Sahaj Yogis or with the schizophrenic or other type.

That’s how, by your own understanding and with your own wisdom, you can grow into Sahaja Yoga very well. This time, there have been cut many people from Italy for Indian Tour compared to other countries, compared to the number you are. But all of you must be there at least once; it will be very helpful. So this change that comes in you gives you all the strength to enjoy your glory, to enjoy your virtues, to enjoy your compassion and goodness, and you realise that you are at a much higher position than these people are; other people are. And then you do not feel any diffidence; on the contrary, you feel extremely compassionate for those who are not there, and adoration for people who are higher.

The whole of this weekend was very enjoyable and My husband has asked Me to thank you all very much for giving him such a nice time. As for Myself, I’m your Mother; I don’t know how to thank you. You enjoy Me and I enjoy you, that’s what: it’s so mutual. Without you, I have no existence, no joy: nothing. I may be anything Myself, but I cannot enjoy Myself unless and until I see My reflection on you. And I love you very much and care for you all the time. In the same way, you should also love each other, forgive everyone; do not be angry with others. Never criticise other Sahaja Yogis, never find faults with other Sahaja Yogis. Open your hearts; you’ll be amazed that, once you open your heart, the whole enjoyment will be your own.

This has been such a nice time in such a spontaneous way and so suddenly, the heavens opened out for us. So I hope to come back to Italy again and there has been a lot of propaganda – I can see that – but we have to do much more propaganda before I come so that the program can be successful. Moreover, you should have some programs again – public programs before My coming – to prepare some more people. Also, I would suggest that Milano people should work out program in Milano, because I’ll be going to Milano also. And I’m sure that you’ll get your land here and your ashram here and in the same way, Milano people will get their beautiful ashram.

May God bless you all. Thank you very much. May God bless you, all of you. May God bless you. May God bless you. Beautiful – everybody’s Kundalini is first class, top class. No problem; it’s all there. [Yogis offer praises] Enjoy your music; I’m enjoying it also. Thank you very much. May God bless you. Good night!
