You Have To Become
Talk to Sahaja Yogis
Kingsley and Ruth Flint's flat, Strasbourg (France)
Talk Language: English | Transcript (English) – Draft

How many are the new Sahaja Yogis in Strasbourg please? Are there any new ones here? From Strasbourg. Yes, that’s true you are, I know that. Is there someone there? No one. Good, it’s beautiful people.

So, the responsibility on the new Sahaja Yogis is much more because the load of the truth they have to bear on one side, load of the truth they have to bear on one side to the Sahaja Yoga and another side to the other people. Because in the beginning we are related to other people and sometimes we get confused with them. We’re related on their own grounds, you see, that’s the problem is, not on our grounds. So one has to have a flexible personality in Sahaja Yoga, to bend down, to pull out people and to hold on to the truth.

In the beginning you may find certain things so stunningly different, but stunningly doesn’t mean shockingly and maybe that others will start trying to tell you something that may, may hamper your progress, those who are not Sahaja Yogis. As if you’re in the intermediary state, just now say, for example, then what happens that you see the other people who are there and you see Sahaja Yogis who are there. Now the Sahaja Yogis who have not matured much come up to the same level, a sort of you get attacked by them or sort of interested in them and then you find them up to your level at the most, or lower, then you get disappointed. But this may not be with everyone because most of you who are very great souls shoot up very fast and see the truth and I feel that about you people in Strasbourg. And as you have to get great Sahaja Yogis here I’ve no worry on that point.

What frightens Me sometimes is that the Sahaja Yogis who are matured and who see something on you which is putting you down get sometimes frantic and start frantically behaving towards you in the sense, they might say, “Stop it, stop it, don’t do, don’t do, what are you doing?” like that. The situation is such that they see somebody with a dagger at your back, you can’t see and they shout, “Get out of it, get out of it,” you see. Then this might upset you because you’ll think, “What are they? They’re very arrogant,” or maybe that they have tried to be frantic or something. And that is why I always say that the leaders have to be very patient and understanding and cooperating and should see that through proper guidance and proper love they can give confidence to the people who have come newly.

Sahaja Yoga cannot spread very fast, one must know, because you have to become. The seed has to sprout and has to become a tree and it takes time. So maybe you may find around you people may not suddenly accept Sahaja Yoga to that extent. But you should not worry, maybe your father, mother, sister, somebody very close might oppose. Even husband and wife may not understand because it’s a different level you are, like an egg cannot understand the bird but little bird which is born just now has to be looked after, has to kept in such a way that all the shells drop out and all the wings are cleared out so it can spread its wings to fly.

There are two types of shells we have actually, one is of ego, another is our conditioning. So you should locate what is the problem is like and watch it as a little bird would watch the shells around, not to be identified with your shells but to separate them and get out of it. It’s very easy after getting your realization to get out of it, only thing you have to stick on to the truth.

It is the truth that you were seeking and it is the truth you must love. Maybe the truth may not be what you have conceived, before. Like Freud I would say, he never loved truth, he loved his own concept and he went after his own concept, you see, misled everyone. So truth is not your concept, it is what it is. We cannot change it. First you see the truth, then you become the truth, and when you become the truth you become the joy. Then you become the source of joy too. Those who see you know that there is joy in this person, they see purity in such a person, they feel love in such a person. There’s another kind of some people whom I’ve met which was real sad for Me that they said that, “Mother you’re so pure, how can we be pure? We have done this mistake, we have done that mistake and we have spoilt ourselves, how can we be pure like you?”

So I’m like a soap, use Me. I don’t mind, anyway you want to use Me, use My photograph, every way, My name, every way, whatever way you want, you use Me and cleanse yourself. And soap doesn’t get spoilt by that, does it? And you can think that this soap never disappears because this soap is the source of all the soaps and you all become the soaps then. So you have to just really enjoy yourself, that’s the sign, when you enjoy yourself I know you are matured. Joy is My child and I want My children to be joyous, bubbling with joy.

I am very happy I could come to Strasbourg and such a lot of joy came to all of us, to Me and to you all and that we have done a good program. But don’t be enamored by the program we had, there are always setbacks. For example in Hampstead we had three hundred new people, new people and only five turned up and one stuck on. And those who stuck the handbills and all the posters were so disappointed about it. It will all work out, don’t you worry. The soil is not so good maybe. If they do not germinate here I’ll take them to India and germinate it, doesn’t matter, we’ll work it out together. A special responsibility on us that we are here to completely transform this universe into the Kingdom of God. Now you have entered into that domain, station yourself properly there and pull out as many as possible.

So this is how we are going, all of us are going to work out, you have brothers and sisters all over Europe, all over America, all over India, all over Malaysia and Hong Kong and last of all and not the least, Australia.

Yogi: And New Zealand.

Shri Mataji: And New Zealand. You suddenly see them somewhere jumping out. Like Ruth once went to Sicily and suddenly she felt for someone that as if there were vibrations from that person. To make it short, she went to the lady and asked her, “Who are you? Are you a self-realized person? Are you a Sahaja Yogi?” She felt the same way about her and she just embraced her, she said, “Yes Mother has given me also realization.” And she told Me that, “My life in Sicily was really getting bored without Sahaja Yogis and with Ruth only I was so much enamoured that we enjoyed ourselves thoroughly, the life was changed completely.”

Like everybody will feel, like you will know all of them, Djamel, he’s from Algeria, so his mother wanted to go to Mecca. So he told his mother, “Why do you want to go to Mecca, Mecca has shifted now to London, better go to London.” And she came, she came with her husband and she got her realization.

It’s such a great thing that we are in this new world and we are entering into this beautiful  domain of God where He has prepared all beautiful things for you. So I hope you’ll make it convenient to come to Navaratri Puja wherever it is, it makes no difference to Me and that if you can come to India, will be good idea, but be prepared, it’s very spartan. Maybe you may not get any food and maybe you may have to go lot of trouble but whatever is the experience of the Sahaja Yogis, you ask them and then you will know what it is like.

It’s beautiful today to be here and I can see a nightingale there, sitting down, just to listen to us. What do you call nightingale in French?

Interpreter: Rossignol.

Shri Mataji: Who?

Interpreter: Rossignol.

Shri Mataji: Rossignol? Oh good, rossignol. All right.

May God bless you all.

Yogi: Shri Mataji some [UNCLEAR thought]

Shri Mataji: Where have you found a place for Warren?

Yogi: Yes I think they have Shri Mataji. Where's Matias?

Matias: Here.

Shri Mataji: Where's Matias?

Matias: Well, there's a place close to Lucerne which is the place where, a certain Buddist is having his headquarters, the maharishi from TM.

Shri Mataji: Not Maharishi, he's a Narakasura.

Matias: A Narakasura, yes. Anu suggested that we got this place because obviously this is going to have a tremendous impact on the whole of Switzerland.

Shri Mataji: All right, good idea. You should be brave like that, I'm happy. But you have to be like Anu to fight all them.

Matias: Right.

Shri Mataji: Not to catch. All right.

Matias: So we got a little village, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: Can I have some water? Yes, so?

Matias: There are three hotels, one for fifty-five beds, another twenty-five, and the third one for hundred and twenty. But they are flexible and I think we would be able to arrange in a way that we would have...

Shri MatajI: Together, I mean they are...

Matias: They are in the same village, yes, small village.

Shri Mataji: All right, but will they have a hall or something?

Matias: They have a hall on Saturday and on Sunday morning, not in Sunday afternoon.

Shri Mataji: All right, we'll have puja on a Saturday night.

Matias: Fantastic.

Yogi's: Jay Shri Mataji.

Matias: So if you will go - give.

Shri Mataji: Yes, I think it's a good idea.

Matias: Yes.

Shri Mataji: Because I don't know English, what have they done. You are better at organizing things, I think, for Navaratri. If you remember, Navaratri was given to you for a puja. And I came for a short time, we couldn't have a proper puja that day, and you gave me a sari as a Navaratri puja sari, which I have kept as it is, to be done with the Navaratri, so it will going to be done that way. I am very happy if it is done here.

Matias: Shri Mataji, on the way back today to Switzerland, we will go there and we will inspect the area and whether it is convenient and we will let you know.

Shri Mataji: It will be anyway more convenient than England, I can tell you.

Matias: Thank you Shri Mataji so much.

Yogi: Shri Mataji, Strasbourg and Milos people, some of them have brought some presents for you. Would you accept them?

Shri Mataji: I mean, I don't know. May God bless you. That's so sweet of you. Thank you very much, thank you. How do you do? Now, I know what it is. You see, you've given Me so many presents now that I have to build a big house to put all these things there. And really I'm doing that. You'll be surprised that I'm making a big temple just to put all the things that you gave Me, so the progeny should see that. But unluckily, It is in some of the presents which were given to Me, there was not even the names or anything, and I didn't know who has given.

So you'll have to go to India and put down your names there. That's what it is. I'm thankful to you for this, but I tell you, there's no need to give any present. But if you have to give, give something simple and cheap, but durable, which I can keep there, something durable, because should be kept for the progeny. Can you tell them?

So I accept it but I would request you it's better to do it on certain pujas, it's better and there's no need to have too many things because and also you must put your names with whatever you are giving Me because I am keeping them all very safe now.

It's very beautiful, very, you know. It's easy for me to open the Kundalini. Yes.
Beautiful but expensive. It's like a Kundalini. Thank you very much. Now this was given to me by Australians, so now I'll have to replace it. All right? Then you keep that one there. Australians have been paying attention too much. It's beautiful, all right? Thank you very much. It's so beautiful, very beautiful it is. Extremely beautiful. 

Interpreter: Elle est très belle.

Shri Mataji: Ah?

Interpreter: I translated.

Shri Mataji: Yes. Thank you very much, it's beautiful. So now what is that? May God bless you. Yes, thank you. This is your name?

Yogi: This is Marie-Louise [UNCLEAR] from [UNCLEAR], Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: Yes.

Yogi: Marie-Lousie...

Shri Mataji: I know, I know, but what has she put here, the name?

Marie-Lousie: It's a poem.

Yogi: It's a poem, Mother, inside.

Shri Mataji: All right, but why don't you put your name here? Did you put your name in?

Marie-Lousie: Only Milus.

Shri Mataji: No, you put it here. Is it from Milus, from all of you? Yes. Then it's all right. You put the name Milus here. It's a beauty, I tell you. I can put it in this finger also, the right Nabhi.

Yogi: Mother, in the envelope there is a poem that Marie-Louise has been reading for you and Kingsley translated it in English.

Shri Mataji: Oh, I see. Then I can read it. I was thinking I'll have to go through the translation. This is in English. All the daisies are there. Trigunatmika. Who did this? You ordered or you got it?

Yogi: It has been handmade by some people she's met. She's working with them.

Shri Mataji: Who is it?

Yogi: It's handmade.

Shri Mataji: Three Trigunatmikas, beautiful, symbolic. This is the Adi Shakti here. It's beautiful. Thank you very much. Can you keep it properly? And it is to be taken. Can you read for Me, please? Proudly.

Yogi: I'll take the microphone.

My brother, do you know a safer shelter than your Mother's arms, a sweeter drink than Her milk, a voice more calming than the heat than the beat of Her heart, or a breath that is cooler than Hers? Have you felt Her caressing your poor bruised body, a softer or silkier touch? A balm which heals with greater care your whole being, all fevered and warm. Do you know of a pearl that is purer than a single tear of Her joy? As She sees you stand proud like herself and all healed, walking straight to the kingdom inside. And do you know of Her mantle, a love which protects you, Her palace, Her home and Her heart, where we'll all go tomorrow? But no, I am feeling you don't know your Mother, my brother, but you tremble desiring. So give me your hand, I'll show you the way. You must walk without fear and always straight on, where the sign it is pointing, Ma Nirmala Yoga.

Shri Mataji: Ah, beauty. So beautiful it is, isn't it? Extremely beautiful. Such [UNCLEAR].

Yogi: Can I read it in French?

Shri Mataji: Yeah, please, please do it in French. It's so touching and so beautiful, so vibrating. Yeah.

Yogi: Mon frère, connais-tu un abri plus sûr que les bras de ta mère, un breuvage plus doux que son lait, Une voix plus calmante que les sons de son cœur, Un souffle plus frais que le sien. Connais-tu ces caresses sur ton cœur tout meurtri, Un toucher plus doux, plus soyeux, Un baume qui pense avec autant de soin Ton corps encore tout fiévreux ? Connais-tu une perle plus pure Qu'une larme de sa joie, Te voyant debout, Guéris, lui ressemblant, Marchant tout droit vers le royaume du soi, Et de son manteau te protégeant. Connais-tu sa maison, son palais, son cœur, Où demain tous nous irons ? Ah, mais tu ne connais pas ta mère, mon frère, Et tu trembles de désir. Alors, donne-moi ta main, je t'indiquerai la voie, Marche sans crainte et toujours tout droit, c'est flasher Ma Nirmala yoga. 

Shri Mataji: Beautiful. Extremely beautiful poem. Now the poets are born, artists are born, such great poets. So beautiful. So these geniuses are going to come up and Sahaja Yoga is going to be expressed in so many ways. I would suggest we now have made committees for poetry and poems in London and all of you, whatever you write, translate it in English and send it over there and they are all going to be compiled and are going to be sent to Nirmala Yoga from where you are going to receive publication of this. And later on we'll publish them as books. So all these articles, all these letters which are very beautifully written to Me or all the beautiful poems, compositions are going to be compiled. And you have to send it to your leaders. And the leaders know where to send because they have got the list of people and their addresses. All right, thank you very much.

That is Indian, beautiful. Wawa. Thank you.

Yogini: Mother, I'm [UNCLEAR] from Swiss and I'm expecting a little child.

Shri Mataji: That's good. May God bless you. Very happy to know that. I think in Switzerland lots of great children are to be born. All right? That's a good idea that those who are coming, those who are coming to India, if you have problem of your children, you can leave them in Rome and there will be people who look after your children for that month or for that five weeks, whatever it may be the problem. And you tell them that this is the time we'll be out and they'll look after your children very well there. And all the children will live together, will be good idea, all the Sahaja Yogi children. And there will be some more sent, some more people will be sent to Rome who will help Guido to do this. It's very kind of Guido to have offered this.

But you must prepare them. Australia is rather big. Now, there's one thing which I'm little concerned is that those who want to get married should give their photographs, their preferences and they should fill in the forms because it may be difficult at a short time to do it. As the leaders like Warren and also Gavin and Bogdan and Dr. Wells, all these senior people are getting married. We found it difficult for them to give the job because those who are younger are already married but they are much younger and those who are senior are still to be married.

So now we thought of who did we think of is Dr. Spyro and?

Yogi: Jamel.

Shri Mataji: And Jamel. Jamel is in the Chelsham Road.

Yogi: They should all be sent to Gavin's office and they will be centralized.

Shri Mataji: You can send it to Gavin's office and then we'll centralize it and we'll decide it. And then we'll give you one or two preferences which you should see according to your age, according to your qualifications, your aptitudes and your preferences. And we'll give you full chance to see for yourself for some time, at least two weeks, you will be able to see them. But I have make one request, those who are getting married, if their marriage is not yet decided, and they want to see the person whom they are going to marry, they should come from the beginning. So they get those two weeks. Would be better, I mean from your point of view and also from My point of view. But I think the first three weeks should be easier because it's holidays mostly. Any other...

Yogi: Shri Mataji, are you accepting a few late applications from some of these people?

Shri Mataji: Yes, yes, yes. It's all right because I'm now, I'll be going to India much later in a month, end of November. You see, when I was going earlier because different but now we will be going later and I've received message from India that it's all right, they can book all the things now and I can pay them later, so no problem. But at the most up to the 15th of November should be the absolute last. 15th of November.

Yogi: We've said the first, but if you extend it Mother, that's your...

Shri Mataji: 15th November last. I mean, they would say, according to the leaders, you see, they would say, no Mother, give only two days more, then five days more. At least one week now, somebody's...

Yogi: One day more.

Shri Mataji: One day more, all right. Now I would say that, actually to be very kind to me, 15th of November, so that we can go to the banks, you see, say about 21st November, all right? I have at least a week in between. So please see that you do it by the 15th November, it should go away to London. It should reach London on the 15th November. May be 12th you might have to do it or a week ahead, wait, I don't know how many days it takes.

Yogi: Between France and UK for example, it's a week / ten days.

Shri Mataji: Week / ten days, they better keep it.

Yogi: They keep the date of the 1st November.

Shri Mataji: 1st November is all right. But you can have one week, say, 7th, 7th, keep it 7th. Yes, by seven you must send, otherwise it is going to be difficult. See now, we take, once you take seven to ten days and then also the bank is not easy, it has to defer it back and all that. But even if the money is there, then we have to go through the whole list, find out all that and it's rather a difficult situation. So before I leave, this money should be sent. And what about the money for the tour? Travelling?

Warren: The air fair, the biggest single problem is there's one aeroplane going from Cairo, going to collect everybody now. The aeroplane's already completely full and bursting. So I think a big abandon of the new Mother Energy will work out somehow.

Shri Mataji: I mean what is, what sort of an aeroplane it is?

Warren: It's a limited aircraft i think of about...

Shri Mataji: Hundred?

Warren: Not so big.

Yogi: Between Lucerne to Bombay only have one flight a week. They are not allowed by Indian authorities to have more than one aircraft and no more than 140 seats per week. That's 140 seats on the flight.

Warren: The French have already had to go on another airline because of this problem, Mother.

Shri Mataji: Really? Only 140?

Yogi: Yes, Mother. You know, there is spatial regulations about various, the same level between two countries. And at the moment, Egypt-Air only have one flight with 140 seats on Bombay, on India.

Shri Mataji Oh, Wow. Then are they going to be more than that, 140?

Warren: No, that all more of less be alright expect for the French, Mother. Anybody else is fine.

Shri Mataji: But why treat the French? Now for the French, then what are you thinking about?

Yogi: Now we got the agreement to fly direct from Paris through Air India so if there is any extra registration we can do, but we must know very soon, I must say before they - I will ask to have an answer on Monday or Tuesday, because at that time. Flights to Bombay are very, very crowded because it is the holidays. So I would like that French people who want to come to India and who are not yet registered, to do it for Monday or Tuesday latest, so that we can have a flight for them.

Shri Mataji: That's a big problem. So they will arrive at what time, Air India's?

Warren: 12.15 on Saturday Mother.

Shri Mataji: And what about all the others? Egyptians also same time?

Warren: Yes, in the morning of Saturday.

Shri Mataji: All right. So there is no, they will then directly go to Vaitarna from the airport. Yes because, you know, it's a big problem going in the city of Bombay and going back, you have to unload and load and so why not, and at Vaitarna you are going to enjoy in any case.

Yogi: It's a nice place.

Shri Mataji: It's beautiful it is, it's beautiful. We've got a land. We've got a big land, forty-two acres. Have you got the photograph? Yes, show, for the school.

Yogis: Aaaw, wow.

Yogini: The French and English translation of one of your talks is present of the meaning of puja and it's for the French who would like to learn English. It's to be read through with the cassette going. And these are a few examples for the different French centers so they can copy it.

Shri Mataji: Whose done this? Whose? You have? Your photograph? You did this photograph? Who did the photograph?

Yogini: Kevin from Australia.

Shri Mataji: It's good, but I like this photograph that you have, the big one in your house. It's a very good photograph, I say. It's really a sage-like photograph. It's beautiful, that one is. You see, this is nice. This is a Mother, affectionate kind and compassionate. But you have to have somebody like a sage to be worshipped. You see, Mother, we don't worship really. We always take advantage.

What do you have for me? This is for me? Or this for you? For me? What? Oh, thank you very much. It's so beautiful. Now this is nice for the baby. Little, little things make them happy. So I would suggest. Can you show that photograph also? See now. You all can have a look at this place. Oh, it's very small. But I'll show you how it is. Now this is, here is the road which is about thirty feet wide which looks like a little line here. You can all see later on. Now this road comes on this hill which is on top. And there from there you see this valley, so big you can't walk, it's too big. From this side flows a brook and there's a river flowing from this side. And this river then goes and meets Vaitarna. And the river Vaitarna word is used always in the Shastras, in the scriptures as Bhavasagara. So Vai means, Vai means the Bhava Sagara and Tarana means to cross over. Vai means the Bhava Sagara, Vai. Yes.

Interpreter: Why?

Shri Mataji: Vai?

Interpreter: Vai?

Shri Mataji: And Tarana means the one that allows you to cross. Vai-Tarana? I mean you will notice this that in India everything has a name and a symbol with it. And it has a meaning, always it has a meaning. Now you can see this for yourself now, for children. Look at the smile. But there are more trees than this, much more. This artist didn't show them because he said he wants to give an aerial view so he doesn't want to show so many trees. But the artist has not seen the place, just through inspiration he's done. Never. I just drew out and showed him and he just made it. He's a Sahaja Yogi.

Warren: Would one of the Swiss be the last to take this and it back to Arnaud particularly please? [UNCLEAR] would you please?

Shri Mataji: This has to go to Arnaud.

Warren: The photograph of Anu.

Shri Mataji: Who will take it? Raise your hands to Anu. Yes, she's here. Who could be more reliable than that? All right. So now I make a move and I say goodbye to you because I think if you are all coming, well and good, but I wanted to go a little bit in the city and I'll have something to eat there, something, not much, but I have eaten with the children all chanas and everything, you see. Then we'll meet at the airport if possible, those who are coming.

Can I have a some water?
