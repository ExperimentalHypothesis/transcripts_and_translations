So welcome to you all, Sahaja Yogis, to this great country of yoga. Today, first of all we have to establish our desire within ourselves that we are seekers and that we have to achieve our full growth and maturity. Today's puja is for the whole universe.

The whole universe should be enlightened with your desires. Your desires should be so intense that they should emit out the pure vibrations of Mahakali Shakti, which is the pure desire of attaining the Spirit. That's the real desire. All the other desires are like mirage.

You are the people who are chosen by God. Specially, first to express your desire, and then to achieve it. And by intense desire of purity you have to purify the whole world. Not only the seekers, but even those who are not seekers. You have to create an aura around this universe, of desire to achieve the Ultimate, the Spirit.

Without desire this universe would not have been created. This Desire of God is the one that is the Holy Ghost, is this All-Pervading Power, is the Kundalini within you. Kundalini has only one desire, is to be the Spirit and anything else, if you desire, the Kundalini doesn't rise. Only when it knows that this desire is going to be fulfilled by somebody, who is facing the seeker, it is awakened. If you do not have the desire, no-one can force you. Sahaja Yogis should never try to force this desire on other people. The first ordeal we face, as soon as you get your Realization, is that you just start thinking of your family. You start thinking, 'My mother has not got it, my father has not got it, my wife has not got it, my children have not got it.'

You must know that these relations are worldly, Sanskrit is "laukik". They are not "aloukik" [divine], they are not beyond the worldly relationships. These are worldly relations, and these attachments are worldly. So if you play into that, of course, as you know, that Mahamaya Shakti allows you to play with that. You go ahead, as long as you like. People bring Me all their relations, parents, this and that and ultimately they discover that this was a very wrong thing they did. They lost so many precious moments, so many hours, so many years, wasting their energy on people who never deserved any attention of Mother. Sooner you realize the better, that this desire may be within you, and may not be in anyone of your so-called worldly relations. Makes no difference.

As Christ was told that His brothers and sisters are waiting outside, so He said: “Who are My brothers and who are My sisters?”

So one has to realize that those people who involve themselves into the problems of their family all the time, and attract My attention, you must know that I am just playing about. It is of no value to you.

For your ascent it is important first of all to have no desires to create desire in your kith and kin. This is the first principle of establishment of Mahakali Power. Specially in India where people are too much attached to their family, it's a very big problem. If you give Realization to one person, you are amazed to see that all relationship they have is with a big bunch of bhoots and once you give Realization to one person you are in for trouble. Then all the bhoots walk in, slowly, torturing My life, wasting My energy, and absolutely disgusting!

It should happen to you to understand that this is not auspicious. If you want to waste your time, I will allow you to waste your time. But if you want to have the ascent fast, first of all one must remember that these are relations which are absolutely worldly relations and this is not your pure desire. So try to separate your pure desire from your worldly desires. It does not by any means, suggest that you give up your family, you give up your mother or give up your sister - nothing. But you witness them and see, as you would see anybody else, and see for yourself, whether they are really desirous or not. If they are - well and good. They should not be disqualified because they are your relations. It works both ways. As they cannot be qualified because they are your relations, they cannot be disqualified because they're your relations.

So in Sahaja Yoga to make your desire a pure desire, you have to get out of so many things. But for people who are attached to their family, are bound by their family, they have to see to it that they do not force Sahaja Yoga on anyone of their relations, at least don't force them on Me.

[Shri Mataji is coughing] : I’ve been speaking every day....

[Shri Mataji is speaking in Hindi]

I have to speak about Shri Krishna, otherwise He thinks I’m just talking about Mahakali [Shri Mataji laughs]

Now this desire within us, which is the Mahakali Power which is manifesting, comes to us in so many ways. As I told you first of all, it comes to us after Realization, because you are all Sahaja Yogis, to do something about our relations. Then the second desire that comes to us, that - let us try to cure people, who are our relations. This is the second desire, you should face yourself and see, that this has happened to many of you. So, right from leprosy to any small thing like cold or sneezing, whatever they have, you think you should bring to Mother. And all the worries of your families should be brought to Mother. Simple thing like pregnancy or sneezing, very simple things - which are so natural are brought into your attention. So when you have them in your attention I say: 'All right, go ahead with it. Try to solve it, if possible.' But if you do not have them in your attention they are in My attention. You leave them in My attention, I'll manage that.

But then it's a vicious circle. It's a very subtle projection of the mind that thinks: “All right then Mother we don't have this in our attention, You'd better look after it." That's not the way. You should have only one intense desire within yourself: "Have I become the Spirit? Have I achieved my Ultimate? Have I risen above the worldly desires?" Purify it. Once you start purifying whatever falls off, I'll look after that. This is just an assurance, but not a guarantee. If it deserves My attention I will definitely look after you.

You have to value your attention as I value My attention. I think you have to value much more of your attention than Me, because I can manage many more things within Myself, because everything is in My attention. But you try to purify your desires away from the worldly problems that are facing you. So you expand it more, then you start thinking: “Mother, what about the problem of our country?” All right, give Me the map of your country - finished. That's more than sufficient. Then purify yourself. The desire that you have, you leave it. And once you are purified that area will be covered through your attention, it's very interesting. When you get over it then only you can throw light, but if you are inside you are hidden by that. Your light is hidden, there's no light emitted. You all rise above that desire.

Every time you get a desire you rise above it, so your light is emitted on that wider problem that you are facing which you think should be solved by Me. These are all My headaches which you are taking on yourself. You have to do only one thing is to become the Spirit that's all. Is a simple thing. The rest of it is My headache.

Now the problems that should take your desire on the collective should be very different. To substantiate your purity, to be fragrant with your purity, your attention should be on the other side. Now you are not facing Me, you are sitting with Me facing the whole world. See, the whole attitude will change. The attitude should be: “What can I give? How can I give? What is my mistake in giving? I have to be more alert. Where is my attention? I have to be more alert towards myself what am I doing? What's my responsibility?” You must desire that you should be pure. You should be pure desire. That means you should be the Spirit.

That, - what is your responsibility to yourself? You should desire that your responsibility to yourself should be manifested, should be complete.

Then your responsibility to this Sahaja Yoga. What is your responsibility to Sahaja Yoga, which is the work of God, which has started and you are My hands. You have to do the work of God, and you have to fight the anti-God elements, the satanic elements. You are not responsible for your family any more, those who are, are the half-baked Sahaja Yogis I said, are useless absolutely good for nothing. All such will drop out, their families will suffer, I know this is going to happen because now the forces are gathering in such a way that sorting out will start.

Your responsibility to yourself, to be the Spirit, your responsibility to Sahaja Yoga, your responsibility to understand Me, better and better and better. Your responsibility to understand this mechanism that is within you, your responsibility to understand how this mechanism works out everything. The responsibility is to how to become a guru yourself. Your responsibility to be a dignified and a glorified personality. A responsibility to be a respectable person and not a cheap personality. Every one of you is worth the whole universe. If you want to rise to that height. Universes of universes can be thrown away at your feet. If you want to rise to that height, to that magnitude that is within you to prosper. But those people, who still want to live on a very low level cannot rise.

For example, the western Sahaja Yogis have certain problems of committing the sin against the Mother, and the eastern Sahaja Yogis have the problem of committing sin against the Father. It's not difficult at all for you to get out of it.

The attention is to be kept pure. In Sahaja Yoga you know all the methods how the attention one can keep it pure. If the attention is not pure then this desire will be always attacked by all petty nonsensical things which has no meaning in your ascent. Now a person who is a good Sahaja Yogi is not bothered about clothes, what others say to him or what others are talking to him, how they are behaving towards him and the attention is not on that criticism that this person is like this, that person is like that. Nor there is the aggressiveness of anyone else, because nobody is the other. But the problem is when I say that, no-one thinks that I'm saying about you, each persons. Those who are aggressive take the other role and those who are non-aggressive think the other way. Like I say something for a person who is aggressive, the non-aggressive immediately thinks of the person who is aggressive, not about himself. You immediately start shifting your mind to other person, finding faults with other people.

So this desire becomes gradually lower and lower and lower because of the loads that are put onto it. So the alertness is very important, complete alertness - ‘satarkata’. That we should keep our attention purely for the sustenance of our pure desire. Desire comes from your heart and you are so built that your brahmarandra is also the heart. If you don't have a clean heart, this won't keep clean. There are people who think if they talk about Sahaja Yoga big, and all that, they are all right. They are cheating themselves. If the heart is not open then this is closed. So try to open your heart by projecting it. Projecting it.

I hope today when you do this puja and you do the worship of Mahakali and this special yAgnya, we will definitely establish this aura, and enlighten the universe. But your outlook should be - 'How much I have contributed to this. Am I still thinking of other people? Am I still thinking of my petty small problems, or I'm thinking of my Spirit?'

So, the left side starts and ends with Shri Ganesh. Shri Ganesh has only basic one quality, that He's completely surrendered to His Mother, He does not know any other God, He does not even know His Father. He only knows His Mother and completely surrendered to Her. But this pure desire has to have the action, and about which I'll tell you later as we will be having more pujas and more pujas.

But today let us establish ourselves into that pure desire, to be the Spirit. Now, as it is, with the Western mind we'll say: 'How?' Is always coming, "How to do it?" Should I tell you? It's very simple. Adi Shankaracharya wrote 'Viveka Chudamani' and so many other books of treaties, and then all these big intellectuals got after his life. And they said: 'How this and how that and how?' He said: 'Forget these people.' Then he wrote 'Saundarya Lahari', it's just a description of his Mother and his devotion to Her and every couplet that He wrote is a mantra.

It is not the surrender of your mind through your mind, but the surrender of your heart. Is absolutely the surrender of your heart. Western Sahaja Yogis know very well how there have been attacks and attacks of negativity on them, specially when horrible people like Freud came to destroy their basic, the roots. And how the West accepted it blindfolded, and put them on the path of hell. All that has to be brought out. That is all nonsense, is wrong, absolutely against God, it's anti-God activity. Then you will realize that you will fight fully, by saying, "This is the destruction of our basics, our roots, when our Mother is the source of everything that is sublime, noble, all that is nourishing, all that is elevating, emancipating. You are cutting us from our roots." When he dealt with, I think, animal-like creatures and he wants all of you to go down to that low level of human beings, which exist as pathological cases, I don't know.

So it is important for you to understand all the attacks that came on you, and be alert and don't be identified with anyone of these.

Last I would say you have come to this country to see the roots and not the shoot. Change your attitude of western style. Telephones are no good. You cannot get any telephones done here. Postage is horrible. Railways are worst. I shouldn't say because we are in a railway. But, the people are excellent. They know what is dharma. They are not being attacked, somehow or other because it being the Kundalini. The Ganesha is sitting here how dare anybody attack? This great Maharashtra has got eight Ganeshas, protecting them. I don't know if these Maharashtrians know this fact. And so many Marutis, so who can attack this country? There is no negative attack except that they themselves are rather money-minded sort. That's the only curse they have, if they can get out of it they are great people.

So, we have come to this country not to enjoy the comfort of the West, but the comfort of the Spirit. So to change your attitude towards India. I don't mean Air India, by any chance. This is a wrong idea that you come by Air India because you are a Sahaja Yogi. Not at all. Air India is nothing to do with Sahaja Yoga. All our railways, all our everything, they have nothing to do with Sahaja Yoga, so far. So you be patriotic and use your own airlines, for heaven's sake. But when you arrive here you will see that the people are too innocent, they can't understand Freud, you can't talk to them, it's beyond their minds. They are a higher type of people in this respect now, because they are not attacked, while you are higher in a way that though you are attacked you have come out of it. You have just turned your faces and you are on the other way. That's something great. So you would also have a confidence there are many people who believe the same way as you believe, in this big country where there's such a big population to support you. So you shouldn't feel lost.

Thus today, we have to start this puja, on Mahakali Day. And is the Day of the Gauri we can say, and Ganesh-Gauri's Day today, though according to the scheduled time it may not be. But according to Me, let us establish within ourself on a subtler level the desire to be pure, and to be cleansed out. All the barriers and unclean things that are within us, to desire to be great Sahaja Yogis, desire to be responsible Sahaja Yogis and desire to be surrendered to your Mother. It's not difficult. That is the easiest, the last one is the easiest, because what you surrender, I don't want anything from you, except that you accept My Love. Surrendering just means you open your heart to accept My Love. Give up this ego. That's all and it will work out. I'm sure it's going to work out. I am trying to push Myself into your hearts and I'll definitely settle down there. [Shri Mataji smiles]

[Shri Mataji talks in Marathi for 25 minutes]

Mahakali has a special capacity to weep, [Shri Mataji smiles] because She is left-sided. When She's helpless and She cannot act, She weeps. This is the only manifestation of Mahakali is that She desires, and if She doesn't get Her desire enacted then She just weeps, that's the only thing She can do in helplessness, isn't it? And sometimes when She's full of love - as I've seen you today all of you coming down here and all these people sitting down here - when She cannot express Herself fully, with full heart, also She feels that joy pouring as tears.

May God bless you for today's puja, I hope all of you will take it in such a way that the subtlest of subtle will be awakened within you, the sensitivity every way, and the love, which culminates into joy. Love that flowers into the fragrance of joy will manifest in today's puja.

May God bless you

[Translation from Marathi]

Now I will speak a little Marathi. A shortcoming of the English language is that if I speak something against them ( the westerners), you understand it. But an advantage of Marathi is that if I tell something against you, they will not understand it. Thus it goes to your advantage and all your wrongdoings, all your misdeeds remain secret which is a big advantage of the Marathi language. For this reason some people think that I do not know Marathi. But I know Marathi, I know Hindi and also I know, much better, the language of bhoots.
 So, you should keep in mind, what I have spoken about Shri Mahakali, give your attention to Shri Mahakali and make efforts to get rid of your faults. I have already told you how people behave,” Shri Mataji please cure my son”, “What has happened to him?” “He is bed-ridden with broken limbs, mental derailment, does not eat or drink anything and unable to bend his back.”.” If you touch him with your feet, it will do a lot of good to him.” So, why has all this happened? This is the result of your past deeds (Karmas). How far can I overcome them, how much can I eat them?. And what is the use of saving such soul? I forgive him so that he can take another life. You should understand. Do favor to him, to yourself and especially to me.” But Shri Mataji let your feet touch my house”. You know all, Shri Mataji is this, that etc, don't have to be told.”Shri Mataji, please come to me just form five minutes, okay two minutes, at least for a minute”.And when I go to their house, I have to climb seven stories. Lift is out of order! I see! Now grind me, I have ground myself for you. I have done a lot. Did whatever you told me to do, cure him, cure her, and cure my aunt! I have cured all. Now I am not going to cure anyone. She may be your aunt, not mine! Understand! I make it very clear! Please do not tell me, “Shri Mataji please see this relation and that relation of mine.” Do me a favor. It has become too much.
 Secondly, do not tell your family problems to me. I am fed up. Your attention should be on Sahaja Yoga. How to spread Sahaja Yoga and what should we do for it, how to develop our meditation centers. What mistakes have we made? Why people do not come to Sahaja Yoga? Sit down and discuss it. It should not be empty talks. Sit down and think. What is wrong with us? What wrong we do in Sahaja Yoga? Why are we not stabilizing in Sahaja Yoga?
 If you do not collect at least fifteen bhoots at Pujas you are not real Mumbaits. If I go to Pune at least twenty one bhoots must be there and being Pune they have to be big bhoots (Mahabhoots). “Unless we bring them in Pujas and trouble Shri Mataji, we are not real Puneits. “ After all they are Peshwas so Shri Mataji must bear with all this. So they are brought in Pujas. It is very special of them.” Shri Mataji shall we attend the Puja? Since all know about the Puja, please allow us to attend. Check before hand whether the people you bring with you for the Pujas are empowered to be there. In the West I have to tell that I am Adi Shakti. Here, it is not necessary since you know who I am and you want to take as much benefit as possible and bring as many bhoots as you want. If you put dirty things in the Ganga, she will wash them but is necessary to always throw only dirty things? So at least some times you think, “ We always take Bhoots to Shri Mataji, let us find some pure people as well!!” What work can bhoots do other than troubling me? So you take care of bhoots and bring good people at Pujas. So far I have been tolerating it but hereafter I shall not. If you bring bhoots I will set ten bhoots in your house. I make it clear, not one or two but ten. It is not difficult for me do that. And I will put them permanently. I am smiling as I say this but I am serious. This thing troubles me a lot!
 Shri Mahakali's form is extremely loving and protecting. Not just this, She is capable of fulfilling all your desires. But if you come with low type of desires, what should I do? How much destruction I have to do! And here are theses foolish things. What should I do? How much should I tolerate just because you are my children? Now this is about bhoots. Secondly, there is terrible attachment, like Mr. Pradhan say, they have fraternity. If one person is possessed he or she joins another like him or her. Exactly. You can make out that they are bhoots .When ten bhoots are together, you should know that all ten are bhoots., because only a bhoot joins nother bhoot. It is typical of them. So, keep it in mind .
 So, get the company of good persons. Good persons should unite and make a group. Do not quarrel. Once you form a group go on enhancing it slowly, means the group becomes a nucleus and the nucleus is to be expanded with more and more good persons coming closer. Quarreling is a sign of bhoots. So is anger. Do not allow anger to get better over you. Or people hasten the work and goad others, do this, do that. I come to know that he ( possessed person) has arrived. What can one do when ten bhoots are around. You should have a kind of dignity. You are like Shivaji Maharaj, aren't you? Only his statues are erected everywhere. You are like him, so, see how dignified he was and how you are! Only yesterday I said in Pune,” Sahaja Yogis sit in line, for having food, for free is the limit. In this Maharashtra when we called our woman sweeper to come and have food she would not come without ten invitations. I have seen it for myself. Leave aside stories of Shivaji Maharaj. I have personally seen that if the woman sweeper from our house, was told to come and have meals with us, she would not came unless she was given invitation in advance. “ Shri Mataji you have not given an invitation card, so how can I come?” She would say. This was the way the people behaved. I have seen it for myself. And now, Sahaja Yogis from good families, decent people, come with their children to eat without paying! When I heard it I was flabbergasted as to what I should have told them. Which is this style? Which is this level? Eating is a big problem with us, wherever it is a free feast. If it is with Bhajan, better still ! We never talk about anything else but food! I cannot understand whether we belong to the category of swine! Basically I cannot understand how these people were born in the region which was the kingdom of Shivaji Maharaj! They rush to place where they can eat. Is it the way one should be?
 There should be a limit to have everything for free. God can see this way of having everything for free. Never ever should we have anything for free. When somebody is going in his car, board it. For what ? “ Money will be saved”. And where will money thus saved go? What will you do with it? Learn to live with self-respect. What will he, who has no self respect, do in Sahaja Yoga. As first thing one must desire the intelligence to become such persons who are respected, who have dignity. Otherwise, if Sahaja Yogis are known to be the ones who want everything for free, who fight and criticize each other, then I get a bad name. So, first of all you should keep this desire. Having everything for free is highly unbecoming of a Sahaja Yogi That I have given you Sahaja Yoga for free does not mean you should move around having everything free. It has become the other way round these days. Instead of paying to the Guru, it is the Guru who is paying. Is it not strange? You should think whether it is acceptable to God, whether he will approve of it. You know everything. You know all scriptures very well and do not have to be told, but see where you fit into it, which position you have brought yourselves to. Further, money is very big hassle. You are looking forward to save money wherever you can and if you can get good deal of money, nothing like it. So, it's a business. You know, Shri Mataji is not doing business and you too should not do any business in Sahaja Yoga. Otherwise don't tell me, you will turn into a business yourself. Keep it in mind.. Sahaja Yoga is reality. It is truth. It is God's empire where your ways are not allowed. Remember it is not your India government but God's empire. Bribery and all money making businesses may be allowed in the India government ( 1982) but they are not permitted in God's empire. I repeatedly warn you! Keep it in mind that hereafter if somebody tries to make money or have things for free and lands up in trouble, I shall not be responsible. How great was the integrity in past! Nobody could beat the Maharashtrians on integrity. They are well known all over India for their integrity even now. Very loyal people. I tell you the poor are far better. Even maidservants; you give them the keys, they will not touch your money. But the Sahibs from the middle class are ready to do anything to keep their status at the cost other people.
 You may have two kurtas less than others. It will not make any difference. If you cannot afford silk kurtas, use cotton ones. I have made you, “Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, the ones to whom the whole earth is a family, i.e. universal personalities but you are not “Udaar Charita” generous. You are miserly about money and Puneits are said to be known for their miserliness. But now they have very big responsibility. Yesterday, such high authority as Chief of Southern Command, General sahib told me that we were sitting on the land of merits (Punya Bhoomi). I said,” Is it?”. Then he said,” Shri Mataji you always say that this is the Punya Bhoomi, then why don't you settle here and residing here help us?” He was all praise for Pune. He is a Sikh, hailing from Punjab. So, as , they say, distant hills appear beautiful, he was eulogizing Pune and I was listening. I too have sung its praise in my speech. So, the Puneits have very big responsibility. How much have I extolled you! I feel, probably, my over- praising you has caused this.
 Some time back I wrote a letter to you and it was published. In that letter I praised you so much that Kulkarni could not translate it nor could I. Taking you as God I worshipped you and here you are standing like beggars. Signs of indigence! Do one thing at the least, on your own; rise above this form and have such mindset as to, “We are the people of self esteem. Why should anyone spend money on us?” Then you will see, verily Shri Lakshmi shall be at your service. But do not do it just for this. Or you will go back to earlier mindset, that we do it because Shri Mataji has told us and I will get a ten page letter from you,” Shri Mataji you told us but Shri Lakshmi is not at our service. On the contrary I have lost Lakshmi. I am left with no money, I am in indebt, my wife has run away etc.”Sahaja Yoga is to be established in such terrible circumstances. It is like a tornado. And the need is for those who will take care of the sapling of Sahaja Yoga in this storm. But, where have those people gone? Have they all gone with Shivaji Maharaj or finished with the rule of the Peshwas? Prepare the people who will take care of the sapling. I will do it if you don't. They will put you all right. Despite having the potential you are not preparing them, then where will I bring them from? So, the Puneits have big responsibility. I have already cleared the Mumbaites. They need not be cleared again. But the Mumbaits should move from their places. They are sticking to a place in Mumbai like Shri Ganapati's idol. But unless they move they will not get any benefits. They don't move at all! They must move. Everybody should make a resolve and after I go back, every Sahaja Yogi from Mumbai should visit all centers of Maharashtra. Every Sahaja Yogi. Money is available and the people at those centers will not leave you starving. Take leave or do anything but everyone must visit at least 2-4 centers. Then you will say,” Shri Mataji has said 2to 4. So we will go to two centers. Since it's two, one should suffice. So, going to Kalwa is all right. There is a center at Kalwa and it is located out of Mumbai. They confirm from the map that Kalwa is outside the borders of Mumbai. So a visit to Kalwa is enough. Then they will tell, “Shri Mataji we had been to Kalwa.” I see! Will you now go to Thana? Go to Thana, like bats! It will suit you better. A number of them are already there. How will it suit you? Best? But, such arrangement should not be for Sahaja Yogis. They are my children.
 What are you doing with yourselves? Watch yourselves. You are my children and you should not go into the state of bats. Never! So take care of yourselves. Time has come when you should be careful. Now, many more people than these will come. Will you rob them too? Are you thugs on roads? Have thugs of that time been born in Maharashtra? If so, say that all of them have been born here and all thugs together are robbing the people.Open your hearts, live with open hearts. Sahaja Yogis will arrive tomorrow. Every one of you should give them some gifts. The last time I spent my money and on behalf of Pune Sahaja Yogis gave the gifts of mangos, brass jugs, and tumblers. It was on the Puneits' behalf and what did the Puneits do? “Shri Mataji we gave them company, had full meals with them”. Everyone must give at least one present to them. Every one of you should make friends with them. But friendship should not be of this type, “ Please lend me Rupees five hundred, I have taken loan, my mother has expired and I have no cloth to cover her.”Instead of indulging into such things you should try to understand what impression this behavior shall create about you. I am doing plain speaking. It is better to do it today. Never indulge into such low type of behavior. You should make friends with them. Show them your magnanimity. They have come for your Darshan. It is like, you go for God's Darshan and find him begging! What is this state? Try to understand! Do not distort Sahaja Yoga to this extent. So please do something for them. They have brought a number of presents for you. They have also spent a lot of money for coming here.If not anything, at least you understand money. So these people have come here by spending so much money. If you give them a present they will always remember it. So hug them with love. Invite them with love to your homes. See how large hearted are Delhi Sahaja Yogis! They said, “Shri Mataji we will keep them with us for seven days. You may do anything but we will not agree. We will have them with us for seven days. We will divide the group amongst us. We live in one room, so what, we will divide them.”This is how Delhites are.
 The Mumbaites are also generous, no doubt. They are generous but do not move. Delhi Sahaja Yogis will come to Lonavla. Tell me, although we are having the Puja on Sunday, how many Sahaja Yogis have come here ( (Lonavla) from Mumbai? They can be counted on finger tips. What has stopped them? Shri Mataji is having the puja today, these people have come from faraway places and you cannot come here from Mumbai! Give me a list of those who have come from Mumbai. Why have others not come today? Why could they not come by a morning train and return by an evening train? Is Lonavla very far? Now if program is held at Kalwa they will attend. They do not have the inner feeling, no longing. If your mother (by birth) had been here you certainly would have come to meet her. Am I not your mother. I am your mothers' mother. Can you do without me? The Mumbaites do not have the inner feeling. What is a benefit of generosity? The inner feelings should be there. It is not possible to buy everything by spending money. The inner feelings can get them. Do you have them? Introspect, “Are we having the inner feelings? You should feel from the hearts. I do not say that all are without the feelings, but some do not have at all. They may say, “Shri Mataji, since you have arrived we have had this benefit.” But let me see what benefit I have got. Now, if four persons come to Mumbai, I have to think in whose house I should put them. I notice that if I put a visiting Sahaja Yogi in somebody's house, he transfers that person to somebody else's house. He has come to us, okay, pass him to another family. I cannot understand what is happening! If they cannot understand your ways, explain to them. But the inner feelings are missing. They are necessary. Everything cannot be purchased by paying money.
 On the other hand when I go to villages, it is like a blossom time there. They have inner feelings, everything is so beautiful and joyous. Let it be a bullock cart or some other conveyance. What, if one has to walk! What, if one has to walk barefoot! When love flows in torrents, one does not need anything more and no desires are left. This is how it should be and it should be learnt from those people. They have open hearts. They will not take even a paisa from me., will not trouble me at all. All arrangements are in place. All after their baths are ready and waiting properly. Then it is felt, “This is my Maharashtra.” So, the Mumbaites and the Puneites have very great responsibility. You are sitting here (highest) like crowns, wielding swords. Let those swords not rust. I want to tell all; go and stay in villages for some time and learn from those people. They may not have in the houses anything to prepare eats, yet with great love they would offer,” Shri Mataji, have a cup of tea, have something, not just a glass of water.”Their love evokes love in one's heart! This is how it should be. The inner feeling is necessary. When you meet these people your hearts should be full of love for them. You should think, “ They have come with love to meet our spirits, where should we keep them, how should we make them comfortable” When they are about to leave , you should feel, “ Now these people who are our relations of hearts are going. When shall we meet them again?” Do not think, “What and how much can we extract from them?” Now forget all that has happened. Forget the bygone and proceed further. As you proceed rise higher and higher. Unless you rise from duality to unity it will not work. Still we are in the duality. A few thorns exist in that duality and they need to be removed.
 Throw away the load of money which is on your head and you will have money in lacs of rupees. It is said,“Yogakshemam vahaamyaham” I shall take care of your Yoga and kshema i.e. benevolence. Detach yourselves and see what happens. Give love to these people, spend money on them. Not much is required. You will not get in debt. I do not want anything. But give them. They have come from foreign countries and you should give them love.
