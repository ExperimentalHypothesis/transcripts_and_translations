I remember that feeling when I went to India with Mother, because on the first tour we were in Nagpur and there was a music programme. Somehow, I always seemed to end up sitting next to Mother at music programmes. And even in Russia many years later, when there was a room with thousands of people in it, somehow I ended up at Mother's feet in this huge hall. But when we were in India, it was the first time I met Baba Mama as well, and it was just an incredible evening's music.

At one point I turned to Mother and I said, “Mother, it's just like one big family.” Mother got up and said, “Bernard says it’s like one big happy family.”

Lovely.

Vinakshi, what was your experience like? Were you seeking, were you looking for God when you got your realisation?

Right.
